So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, “yeah, he’s dead,” And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, “wait a second! Aw, shit! “I was taking a nap! Jesus! “you gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.” And then my daughter comes home. “why did he die, da–” Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That’s the reason. That’s the actual reason, is because didn’t matter That he was alive. That’s why he’s dead. He didn’t know his name, and he didn’t love you back. These are the facts about that fish’s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don’t know which one. I don’t care. I don’t think they need to be separate things. I really don’t. They don’t care, and we don’t care. There’s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, “ok, everybody. “from now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And–you know what?–Penguins are all seals now,” And we would all be like, “yeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.” Anyway, so we’re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he’s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he’s going– They’re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you’re gonna see little, white sheep Going, “baa,” but they’re all fat and shit-colored, And they’re like– Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don’t go– They go– My daughter’s like, “what is he saying?” I don’t know! “I’m a slave! Kill me!”',\n",

Anything else, any other kind of thing, you’re in the food chain. You’re in the food– we are out of the food chain. I don’t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That’s how all life ends, is– Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We’re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just “I love you. Bye.” I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You’re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You’re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it’s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, “beh,” and you’re like, “fine,” And it’s just, “why?” You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone’s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don’t get it! Then you’re walking to work like, “why do I even bother? “shit! Goddamn it! “there’s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!” You think that sharks– Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they’d be bummed ’cause I don’t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they’re slick. They swim around like, “hey, nobody has any idea what’s down here,” And we’re all up here like, “there’s totally a shark right there.” It wouldn’t be fun being a predator, either. If you’re a predator, imagine if every time you’re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who’s running for his life. You gotta– “come on, dude! Shit, get over here!” And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That’s why animals just– They go, “let’s do this together, man. “you chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.” That’s why they do it like that. “fuck it. I’m eating babies. This is bullshit.” “grownups ain’t worth the meat.” Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn’t a gay voice, by the way. It’s not. Shut up. yeah.',\n",

I don’t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can’t get a fountain made without– “can you make me a fountain?” “yes, I’ll get started right away! “Yes! Yes! It’s finished!” And it’s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. “just piss on me forever!” Anyway, there’s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn’t look too good, you know?

Anyway, but so there I was. I’m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there’s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there’s this guy looking at me. I notice he’s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he’s all spiffy-looking. He’s got brown shoes, and he’s looking at me like, “” I can tell he was thinking I don’t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he’s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I’m sitting there thinking, Like, “please do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,” And I’m trying to look even more gross, And I’m, like, pulling up my shirt, “” And then I see him go, “no. That’s not gonna do at all,” And he comes over to me, “” and I’m like, “Num num num!” I’m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I’m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. “rrgh!” So he comes over, says, “excuse me, “do you live in this building?” And I said, “no,” ’cause why not start there? I said, “no.” He goes, “well then, what are you doing here?” And I said, “I just need to rest. I’m having a hard time.” He says, “this is private property,” And I said, “well, I don’t really believe in that.” You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, “well, if you don’t leave, I’m gonna talk to the doorman.” I was like, “can I just stay, like, five more hours?” So he’s–“no,” and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, “no. That guy lives here. It’s OK,” And the look on his face– mwah mwah! Num num!– It was just so– It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It’s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody’s feelings. That’s how excited I was.',\n",

I have moments where I’m like, “wow, this seems early for this.” Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I’ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I’ll realize, “I need to wipe my ass right now.” “I mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.” Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I’m 45. Already, my asshole’s just like, “Just– ” My asshole– My asshole’s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda… Loose and ineffectual. My asshole’s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up.

This is way better. This is what– At my age, if I’m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. “what? Why do I– no. Why, though?” “Your car is being towed right now!” “Well, that’s what happens to me, then. That’s– I accept that.” ’cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, “do I really want to be alive anymore?” Like, let’s start with that, And then I gotta, “” start kind of rocking to get momentum, “” like I’m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. “shit.”',\n",

And I know other people’s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J.

It means that even if they’re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They’ve been there longer. If you’re older, you’re smarter.

This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn’t clap. Why? ’cause they’re smart. They’re sitting in the dark going, “I don’t have to clap. I don’t have to do anything.” They’re not doing it, and they’re right. You know why? ’cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don’t know why I’m asking. How do you know what– OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I’m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That’s every time. “Whoo! Whoo!” every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you’re not the only people here. That’s like going to a cancer ward– “not me! Whoo! I don’t have it! I don’t have it!” If you’re older, you’re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, ’cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He’s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He’s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair… From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That’s what I’m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He’s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He’s seen more. He’s seen history. He’s witnessed history, Even if it’s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy ’cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, “the president’s kind of disappointing.” Really?

This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they’re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don’t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam’s apple and a smelly t-shirt. “hey, I’m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.” “so where do I– everywhere? OK. Cool.” But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I’d like to make one of those “it gets better” ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, “listen, man. “I know it’s tough right now. “You’re vaguely heavy with no face. “You have zero value on the sexual marketplace. “You feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, “but it gets better because you’ll all grow up, “and you pretty much look just like this your whole life, “and they don’t. “Their options start running out really fast, “and you’re gonna be there. “As long as you stay relatively employed and washed, “you’re gonna be amazing in your 40s. “You’re gonna be– “you’re gonna be the branch that she can grab “before she hits the ground. “It’s gonna be so great. “It just takes time for her circumstances “to match your looks, but it’s gonna happen. “It’s gonna happen. “When real shit matters, you’re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.” It’s just time.

That’s the one way we’re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, “yeah.

You know, when I see a date, I’m always happy when I see a couple on a date ’cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there’s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she’s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, “just go the fuck home and jerk off. Don’t do this!” But he walked up and said, “hi. Yes,” And she’s like, “” “no, no, no. A second. Give me a second,” And you try to get through this membrane of, you know– And then, if it works And you say, “you wanna go out sometime?” Sometimes she’ll say yes, and if she says yes, that’s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species’ existence counts on them doing it, and I don’t know how they– How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We’re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we’re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We’re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That’s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That’s the whole thing. That’s it, just our own heart going, “dude, I can’t– “you can’t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,” But women still– “yeah. I’ll go out with you alone at night.” What are you, nuts? “I’ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?” “To your death, statistically.” How do they still do it?

A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He’s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive– Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, “well… “ha ha! “well, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh…” Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that’s later down the line and something has happened. There’s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness ’cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, “I’m gonna let him fuck me.” They just get to decide. Something he says, and she’s like, “that was good. He’s gonna fuck me later,” And he has no idea.

If you’re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, “could you squeeze my tit for one second?” And 100% of us will go, “yes, of course.” That doesn’t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. “yeah. Ok.” Beep! “don’t worry. He’s not your tits. Don’t worry about it.” I don’t know why we love tits so much.

I don’t know if you read “the grapes of wrath,” But that’s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl’s tits, And then the book is over, and you’re like, “Jesus! What happened at the end there? That’s crazy.” There’s no other book in that genre. There’s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very– “and then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.” “holy moly with that!” “the end.” “my god! “that is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book.

I know it!” Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, ’cause you could drive a tack in there, I’m not gonna feel it, But a tit– Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow… “it’s a tit! I touched a tit! “I touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.” That’s rare, to touch one tit. It’s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn’t have permission, But otherwise… When tit access is granted, It’s usually good for two tits at a time. It’s, once you’re on one– You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn’t get the second one. “yeah, it’s like your mom’s dirty whore tit.” “why? What? I said I liked it. “that’s what I meant, is that I like it. “I like your mom’s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,” And if it’s up to the guy, we’re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, “you know what? “I’m good with the one. That’s fine for me. Everything in moderation.” We’re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of– “yeah–” “there’s a bomb!” “shit! Come on, let’s get– “come on!

              " '“Behind The Wheel”\\nIt’s pretty good, and I’ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I don’t know. You know, it’s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as they’re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I’m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I’m behind the wheel, which is when I’m at my most dangerous. When you’re driving, That’s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life ’cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it’s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of–I don’t know– sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, “worthless piece of shit.” I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? “Worthless piece of shit”? That’s somebody’s son. And things I’ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did– I don’t remember, even– And I yelled out my window, I said, “hey, fuck you!” Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person’s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, “hey, fuck you!”? “worthless piece of shit!” No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there’s nothing you would not say to them. “I hope you die!” I said that to a person. “I hope you die!” Why? ’cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!” I mean, what am I capable of? I’d like to think that I’m a nice person, But I don’t know, man.',\n",
              " '“If Murder Was Legal”\\nA lot of it is context. There’s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I don’t know. I’d love to think, “I would never do that,” But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We’d like to think it’s ’cause, Like, “I would never do that.” No. It’s ’cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor– Like you get a thing in the mail– “shit, they had a camera there. Well.” If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn’t trust somebody who didn’t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn’t like them. “I never killed anybody.” “OK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. “I mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. “what’s wrong with that guy? He’s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.” “I think he’s nice.” “shut up, Janet.” They would just– If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That’s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you’d go to a mall, there’d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just– “I told you to stop it! You didn’t listen to me!” Just–pbbt! There’d be just– You’d be stepping over dead kids. There’d be, like, a new problem. “you have to clean up your kids “when you kill them ’cause it’s gross. “it’s bad for the environment. “if you murder your child in a public place, “please use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers “every three feet of America. “put your murdered child in the red bag “with a logo of a murdered kid on it “next to the other logo that tells you “not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag “because they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.” That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad thought.',\n",
              " '“Of Course, But Maybe”\\nYou know, you have your bad thoughts. Hopefully you do good things. Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing– That’s the thing I believe– and then there’s this thing, and I don’t believe it, but it is there. It’s always this thing and then this thing. It’s become a category in my brain That I call, “of course… But maybe…” I’ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe… Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you’re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I’d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe… maybe if we all just do this for one year, we’re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you’re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it’s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course… But maybe… Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it’s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It’s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you’re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don’t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it’s happened– Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it’s a terrible, horrible thing, of course… But maybe… Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, “how did they build those pyramids?” They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew ’em up and didn’t give a shit what happened to them. There’s no end to what you can do when you don’t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That’s where human greatness comes from, is that we’re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they’re making these, They jump off the fucking roof ’cause it’s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while you’re taking a shit.',\n",

And I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019ll be a problem in the future, but it\\u2019s a problem now and I don\\u2019t see it getting better. Um\\u2026 I\\u2019ll give you an example, right? I was in the car, and my son Hank was asleep in the back seat, and we\\u2019re driving along, and on the radio comes Madonna, and my girlfriend just slips into conversation, \\u201cOh, I used to party with Madonna.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cYou fucking what, when?\\u201d And she went, \\u201cI used to party with Madonna.\\u201d Now, I should fill you in a little bit on this. My girlfriend used to be a model in Miami, right? I\\u2019m not bragging. I didn\\u2019t get the model years. I didn\\u2019t get those years. I\\u2019ve seen the photos. Very impressive. Um\\u2026 So, I said, \\u201cSo you used to party with Madonna. Madonna used to have big parties and invite models over, right?\\u201d And she went, \\u201cNo, no, it would just be me and a few other people.\\u201d I go, \\u201cYou need to elaborate on this story right now.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cOh, okay, I used to date the center for the Miami Heat.\\u201d As soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an NBA center, even if this guy\\u2019s even slightly in proportion\\u2026 a lot of things flood through your head. First thing is, \\u201cThat\\u2019s why your cunt\\u2019s so fucked up.\\u201d That\\u2019s a big one. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why our child came out while you were walking. I understand.\\u201d So she said, \\u201cI used to date the center for the Miami Heat. His best friend was Dennis Rodman. Dennis Rodman used to go out with Madonna, and we used to go over to Madonna\\u2019s house.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cThis one time, the four of us were over at Madonna\\u2019s house, and we were all fucked up on drugs, and one thing led to another\\u2026\\u201d And then I went, \\u201cShut the fuck up!\\u201d And she went, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I said, \\u201cI know what \\u2018one thing led to another\\u2019 means! You all started fucking each other!\\u201d And she went, \\u201cWe did. We started\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cJust shut up!\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cWhat do you care for?\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re the mother of my child! I don\\u2019t wanna picture you being fucked by a 7\\u20192\\u2033 NBA player while you\\u2019re licking out Madonna\\u2019s muscular vagina and Dennis Rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock, going\\u2026\\u201d [Moaning] And she goes, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re being silly. What do you care for? You\\u2019ve partied way more than I have in my life.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cThat is not true. I\\u2019ve gotten wasted way more than you have, but I have, in no way, partied way more than you have. Often, I get wasted just by myself. I wouldn\\u2019t call it a party.\\u201d For most of my career, I was a struggling comedian, right? And this is how struggling comedians party, right? It\\u2019s 5:00 a.m., Monday, right? We\\u2019re in a one-bedroom apartment. Seven of us are standing around a coffee table, trying to stretch out two grams of coke. One of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories\\u2026 and the rest of us are talking about where women might be. One of us has come up with a plan. The plan goes like this, \\u201cWell\\u2026 nurses will be finishing their shift soon. Maybe if we just stand out the front of the ER, they\\u2019ll appreciate seven funny guys.\\u201d [Chuckles] I don\\u2019t\\u2026 You know, I\\u2019ve never partied like a model. I have partied twice in my life. Twice. Like, really partied. I\\u2019ve had good nights out, but I\\u2019ve really partied twice. If you really party, and most people never experience this, it\\u2019s an amazing thing. It happens in Vegas. It can only happen in Vegas, and it\\u2019s gotta involve celebrity, right? I\\u2019m not famous, but the people around me were super famous, and I was at this party in the night club, and they took me in. And then there\\u2019s the night club, but then there\\u2019s the real night club out the back, which is, like, the size of this stage. It\\u2019s only a little room. And you go back there and you can just\\u2026 They encourage you to take drugs in the open, and you\\u2019re just doing it off a key, [Sniffs] and they\\u2019re going, \\u201cNo, dude. Use the table. Don\\u2019t use your\\u2026\\u201d And I go, \\u201cOh, oh. Oh, sorry. Um\\u2026\\u201d And it\\u2019s confusing at first, and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room. Just bring \\u2019em in like, \\u201cHuh?\\u201d And you can do this. You can go\\u2026 \\u201cUh\\u2026\\u201d Like that. And they\\u2019ll drag these women away. It is the best thing you\\u2019ll ever do with your life. When you party that hard as a man, there\\u2019s a lot of remorse \\u2019cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money. You wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover, and you go to your friends. You go, \\u201cOh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I spent $5,000.\\u201d When a hot girl parties that hard, she wakes up in the morning and goes, \\u201cOh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I made $5,000.\\u201d And that\\u2019s a vastly different emotion that\\u2026 I don\\u2019t think women will never\\u2026 Yeah, okay. This is the thing. In America, at the moment, they\\u2019re trying to raise the minimum wage to, I don\\u2019t know, $16 an hour or something like that, and whenever they bring up this argument, they always go, \\u201cAnd still to this day, women only earn 70% of what men earn in the workplace.\\u201d And of course, that\\u2019s disgusting. How dare women earn so much? Like\\u2026 a lot of things that I say tonight will be jokes that I don\\u2019t actually mean, but this is something I\\u2019m really passionate about. Women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace. I\\u2019m sorry. I\\u2026 [Audience whooping] I\\u2019m not being a misogynistic bastard, right? I\\u2019m not saying that women don\\u2019t work as hard. I\\u2019m sure they do. I\\u2019m not saying they don\\u2019t do as good a job. What I\\u2019m saying is they don\\u2019t deserve to earn as much money as men. Right? Men need that extra 30% to buy meals and drinks and Jim Jefferies tickets and all that shit! [Audience cheering] Now\\u2026 I\\u2019m sure there\\u2019s women in this room that are saying, \\u201cOh, I pay for my drinks. I bought my own ticket.\\u201d And don\\u2019t think we don\\u2019t appreciate the uglies, \\u2019cause we do. Right? We do. But there\\u2019s little things in society that you can\\u2019t change. Men have extra expenses that you\\u2019ll never understand. There\\u2019s holidays that are just for women. Like Valentine\\u2019s Day is just for women. They say it\\u2019s for romantics. They say it\\u2019s for couples or something like that. It\\u2019s just for women. There\\u2019s no man who gets excited by Valentine\\u2019s Day. There\\u2019s no man that when he sees the Valentine\\u2019s Day decorations go up in the shopping mall, he goes, \\u201cOh, Valentine\\u2019s Day is coming!\\u201d Valentine\\u2019s Day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head, and it goes like this, \\u201cHow much money do I have to spend today so that you won\\u2019t act like a cunt?\\u201d It doesn\\u2019t stop there. Mother\\u2019s Day! Mother\\u2019s Day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old. My girlfriend\\u2019s first Mother\\u2019s Day. And she went, \\u201cOh, I wonder what I\\u2019ll get for Mother\\u2019s Day.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cProbably fucking nothing. He\\u2019s got no money. He\\u2019s six months old. What do you think he\\u2019s gonna buy you?\\u201d Within an hour, her friends were over at the house, just by coincidence, telling me what a bad person I was and how important Mother\\u2019s Day is to a new mum, you know? And so, I went and bought her a cappuccino machine \\u2019cause I assumed that\\u2019s what Hank would have wanted her to have\\u2026 and I wrote a card. I\\u2019m not a bastard. I wrote a card. I\\u2019m right-handed. So I got my left hand. Every new dad knows this. You get the crayon and you go, [Imitating child] \\u201cHappy Mother\\u2019s Day. Love, Hank.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cH-A-N\\u2026\\u201d And then I did the \\u201cK\\u201d back-to-front because he\\u2019s a fucking moron. See, now I know there\\u2019s people in the room, they\\u2019re thinking, \\u201cWell, fathers have Father\\u2019s Day.\\u201d Father\\u2019s Day is bullshit. It\\u2019s fucking shit, Father\\u2019s Day. Father\\u2019s Day came around and my girlfriend went, \\u201cWhat do you want for Father\\u2019s Day?\\u201d And I went, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want anything. Don\\u2019t even worry about it. I don\\u2019t want anything.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cCome on. You gotta have something.\\u201d I said, \\u201cHonestly, I don\\u2019t want anything.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cCome on.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cIt\\u2019s my fucking money. Just don\\u2019t touch it. Just leave my money alone. How hard is this? How about, for 24 hours, you don\\u2019t touch my fucking money? That would be a gift.\\u201d That\\u2019s why every single father has that one Father\\u2019s Day gift that they cherish, and it\\u2019s shit! It\\u2019s, like, a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handle\\u2019s too big, and it says, \\u201cI heart Dad.\\u201d And they keep that for 20 fucking years, this mug. And do you wanna know why they like it? Every now and again, they look at it and go\\u2026 \\u201cThat cost me nothing, that mug.\\u201d [Audience whooping] See\\u2026 wouldn\\u2019t it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff, but didn\\u2019t cost anything, that everyone could participate in, right? I\\u2019ve got it, right? April 18th\\u2026 Anal Sex Day. [Men cheering loudly] It\\u2019s good, isn\\u2019t it? Everyone\\u2019s girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on April 18th. It\\u2019s nice. A month before, you\\u2019d be walking around the shopping center going, \\u201cOh, the decorations are up!\\u201d [Men whooping] And it\\u2019s good \\u2019cause if your bird didn\\u2019t take it in the ass, you could do the same thing that women do on Valentine\\u2019s Day when they don\\u2019t get a gift. You could go like, \\u201cOh, me mate, Jason, his wife took it in the ass twice. Yeah, obviously, they\\u2019re more connected than we are. They\\u2019ve, uh\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, I don\\u2019t do much merchandise after my shows and stuff, but I\\u2019m thinking of bringing out some April 18th T-shirts. Not even putting \\u201cJim Jefferies\\u201d on them or anything. Just T-shirts that say, \\u201cApril 18th.\\u201d \\u2018Cause it\\u2019s good, right? You\\u2019re in a bar. You\\u2019re a guy. You see a guy at the other end of the bar with an April 18th, and you go\\u2026 Fucking friends for life, right? But even better, you see a girl with an April 18th T-shirt. The weird thing is I\\u2019m bigging-up anal sex here, and I don\\u2019t even really like fucking girls in the ass that much. I\\u2019m not even a huge fan. I much prefer the cunt. I think it\\u2019s a much more\\u2026 I think that a cunt is a much more purpose-built thing to fuck. But, you know, anal sex\\u2026 Oh, you know\\u2026 I do it. I get involved, \\u2019cause I feel like I have to. You know, I\\u2026 But I\\u2019ve never been a big fan of the ass fucking, I, uh\\u2026 When I watch it on porn, it seems very inviting. The girl\\u2019s taking it so fluently in her ass, and she seems to be having fun, and, uh\\u2026 But the thing is, you can\\u2019t smell porn. You don\\u2019t smell porn. You just\\u2026 You just watch it. They never\\u2026 And it\\u2019s different, porn. It\\u2019s different. They clean the girl\\u2019s asshole. They pump water into it until it\\u2019s very hygienic. I\\u2019m sure. And the girl seems to be so happy. She\\u2019s like\\u2026 You\\u2019ve got it in her pussy, you\\u2019re fucking her, and then she\\u2019s like, \\u201cPut it in my ass.\\u201d She\\u2019s inviting. It\\u2019s like you\\u2019re doing her a favor in porn. And then she\\u2019s like\\u2026 She says things\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know, things like, \\u201cI\\u2019m enjoying that. Keep putting it in my ass. Fuck my ass. I love a cock in my ass.\\u201d And\\u2026 And the experience I\\u2019ve had in my own life has been vastly different. I\\u2019ve\\u2026 My experience has been a lot of crying. Now, although that can help you come at times, it\\u2019s not what you want\\u2026 It\\u2019s not what you want for every day. I like the girl who acts like she\\u2019s enjoying it. Like, you know when your girlfriend\\u2019s like, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna act like I enjoy it.\\u201d She does that whole, \\u201cYeah. Oh, no, that\\u2019s good.\\u201d [Moaning] Ahh! \\u266a I\\u2019m having a good time \\u266a And then they\\u2019re always going, \\u201cAre you done? Are you close to done?\\u201d You never fuck a pussy and they go, \\u201cAre you almost done? Finish this.\\u201d Like that. If you\\u2019re fucking ass, they don\\u2019t want you\\u2026 They want it all over, quick. And they do other things, the porn girls. I don\\u2019t know how much they get paid. I\\u2019m sure it\\u2019s more than what the men get paid. It\\u2019s the opposite bit of society. Um\\u2026 But they do a thing called \\u201cATM.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know if you know what that is, kids. That stands for \\u201cass to mouth.\\u201d That\\u2019s where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus, and she\\u2019ll put it directly in her mouth, and she\\u2019ll say something like, \\u201cI love the taste of my ass. Let me taste my ass.\\u201d And then the man, as a favor to this woman, puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work\\u2026 [Applause] she\\u2019s been doing. Now, I had a drunken night with my ex-girlfriend where she thought she\\u2019d be all wild and try that. Once again, vastly different experience. I\\u2019m not a big fan of the ass fucking, and I don\\u2019t know of any man, if they\\u2019re truthful, really is. Now, there\\u2019s women in the room who are thinking, \\u201cWell, why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass?\\u201d [Woman shouting] What a good question. [Woman whoops] Women, the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because\\u2026 we know you fucking hate it. [Cheering] So\\u2026 I\\u2019m a father. Um\\u2026 I love my son! I love my son the same way that I love cigarettes. I like to hold him for five minutes every hour, and the rest of the time, I\\u2019m thinking about how he\\u2019s fucking killing me. He\\u2019s a good little boy. No, he\\u2019s a great little fella. I really like him. Um\\u2026 My girlfriend super loves him, though. It\\u2019s fucking creepy. And\\u2026 I\\u2019m glad I have a son. That worked out good for me. I wouldn\\u2019t be a good father to a girl. It wouldn\\u2019t be good for me. Nothing weird. Wouldn\\u2019t fuck it. I\\u2026 I just don\\u2019t get along with women. You know how it is. I don\\u2019t want them in my house, and\\u2026 So\\u2026 Because you dream, see\\u2026 For example, okay? When Hank was born\\u2026 the couple over the road, within two weeks of Hank being born, had a baby girl, and rightly or wrongly, the first thing that went through my head was\\u2026 \\u201cAw, that\\u2019s great. I hope Hank fucks that one day.\\u201d That\\u2019s what I think\\u2026 \\u2018Cause that\\u2019s what I think about my son. I hope when he\\u2019s of age, he just fucks everything. I don\\u2019t care if my son is gay or straight. All I care about is, when he is of age, that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires. That is my dream for my son! [Audience cheering] But never in the history of fathers and daughters, has a father held his baby girl and gone, \\u201cOh, I hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life. I hope you\\u2019re never shy of a cock. I hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up.\\u201d Right, you know\\u2026 And it\\u2019s not just me. Women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well. My girlfriend goes to the gym every morning. I go there very occasionally, and when you go to the gym, there\\u2019s a little daycare cr\\u00e8che thing in the gym where you can hand your child off, and inside that daycare, there\\u2019s, like, three women in their 50s. They\\u2019re very nice ladies, and you hand your kid off and he plays. Then when you finish your workout, you come and get him. And there\\u2019s a woman that works there who just loves my son. She sees all the other kids, but she loves Hank, and Hank fucking loves her, and the two of them light up when they see each other. And it\\u2019s super cute, I bring Hank up the stairs, and he starts going, \\u201cUh, uh!\\u201d Trying to reach at her, all right? And she does this, she goes, \\u201cEveryone, my boyfriend\\u2019s here. Here\\u2019s my boyfriend. Give him here. He\\u2019s my boyfriend.\\u201d And then she kisses him, and she goes, \\u266a My boyfriend gives me kisses My boyfriend gives me kisses \\u266a It\\u2019s fucking adorable. But I tried doing that with a baby girl\\u2026 Let\\u2019s say you go to the gym and there\\u2019s a daycare, and me and a couple of my mates are working there. \\u201cHey, everyone\\u2026 me girlfriend\\u2019s here. Give her here. Give her here. She\\u2019s my girlfriend. My girlfriend gives me kisses. You know that, right? She\\u2019s always giving me kisses. Enjoy your workout. Don\\u2019t worry about a thing.\\u201d [Applause] [Cheering] So\\u2026 Also\\u2026 it\\u2019s just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter. It\\u2019s just little things. Even when they\\u2019re babies, it\\u2019s just easier. There\\u2019s a wiping technique when you\\u2019re wiping a baby\\u2019s ass. I don\\u2019t know if you have children, but this is how you do it. The baby lays on its back. You put their feet together. You lift the feet up, and then you go in and wipe. With a boy, you can wipe like that. Up and down, side to side, whatever the fuck you want, right? With a girl, you gotta wipe downward and away. Downward and away. It\\u2019s very important that you wipe away from the cunt. Very important. \\u2018Cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts. They do. They fucking hate it. Boys don\\u2019t give a shit. Fucking\\u2026 My son will have shit all over his dick and balls, and I\\u2019ll be cleaning it off under the foreskin, and he\\u2019ll be laughing like it\\u2019s the best day ever. Even at my age now, I find it funny if I have shit on my dick. If I fuck my girlfriend in the ass, I pull out, I\\u2019ve got shit on my dick, I\\u2019ll ring me mate Jason up and go, \\u201cHey, Jason\\u2026 It\\u2019s happened again. I got shit on my dick.\\u201d And he\\u2019ll tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick, and we\\u2019ll laugh and laugh and laugh. But never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and she\\u2019s thought, \\u201cOh, I can\\u2019t wait to call Karen.\\u201d [Chuckles] [Laughs] When you\\u2026 When my girlfriend got pregnant\\u2026 When you meet\\u2026 When you haven\\u2019t got a child, couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children. Whenever you meet couples with children they\\u2019re always like, \\u201cIt is the most fulfilling thing I\\u2019ve ever done with my life. My heart grows larger and larger every day.\\u201d And then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant, those same people went like this, \\u201cYou\\u2019re never gonna sleep again! [Laughs maniacally] Forget about it. It\\u2019s over. You\\u2019re not gonna sleep.\\u201d They\\u2019re constantly telling you you\\u2019re not gonna sleep. Raising a baby is not that hard. I\\u2019ll tell you what, it\\u2019s easier than a coke habit. I had a coke habit for seven-and-a-half fucking years! At least it\\u2019s not me who wakes up crying anymore! I can sleep through other people crying. I\\u2019ve had girlfriends. That\\u2019s like white noise to me. I find it soothing. See, me and my girlfriend, just two months, we went, \\u201cFuck it! Let\\u2019s have a kid.\\u201d Fucking did it, right? These other people, man\\u2026 You know these couples, and they date from high school, and then they go out for a bit longer, and then after being together for like, seven years, they go, \\u201cWe\\u2019re getting engaged. You wanna come to the party?\\u201d And you wanna say, \\u201cNo, you\\u2019re really boring and we hate you.\\u201d But you go, \\u201cOh, okay, great. You\\u2019re still together, are you? You fucked one person, have you? Oh, how exciting.\\u201d And\\u2026 And then what they do is they don\\u2019t have a kid right away because they\\u2019re still not ready. \\u201cWe have to see how our careers are going and shit.\\u201d And what they do is they get a dog, and then they act like the fucking dog\\u2019s their baby. They refer to it as their fucking baby. They send you a Christmas card of them holding the dog\\u2026 and it says, \\u201cFrom our family to yours.\\u201d And then you have a barbecue, and you invite them, the humans, right? Then they come over. This fucking dog runs in, jumping over everything, and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cWhat the fuck is this shit?\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe had to bring him. We bring our baby everywhere.\\u201d And you go, \\u201cWell, your baby is biting my actual baby. Can you control\\u2026\\u201d And then, eventually, they decide they\\u2019re gonna have a kid \\u2019cause they\\u2019ve learned so much from the dog, and then they bring the kid back, and the dog runs up, like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s happening? A new person.\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cFuck off. We don\\u2019t love you anymore. We\\u2019re going.\\u201d And they think they\\u2019ve learnt something from the dog, and they haven\\u2019t learnt anything. What happens if your girlfriend\\u2019s away on work and the dog dies? You go off, you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog\\u2026 try to pass it off as the same dog. What happens if your girlfriend\\u2019s away on work and the baby dies? Very hard\\u2026 to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have. Easier if you\\u2019re black or Asian. [Audience cheering] Boston, no! No! No! Shut up! I will not put up with racism at my shows, okay? I\\u2019m not saying \\u2019cause they look the same. I\\u2019m saying \\u2019cause they\\u2019re easier to purchase. [Audience cheering] [Audience whooping] If Angelina Jolie and Madonna have taught us anything\\u2026 it is that you can buy black and Asian people. I\\u2019m yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from Norway with a child, going\\u2026 \\u201cYolanda, quick, get Hans. Bring him over. Come on.\\u201d [Jeffries chuckles] I\\u2019m gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit. Uh\\u2026 Gun control. Now\\u2026 No, wait. Before you\\u2026 Don\\u2019t get excited because the other people have guns. The anti-gun people are like, \\u201cYeah! Do it, Jim!\\u201d No, let\\u2019s just\\u2026 [Shushes] Now, before I start saying this, I wanna say this, right? I believe in your right as Americans to have guns. I\\u2019m not trying to stop you from having guns. All I\\u2019m saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion. My opinion on the\\u2026 Oh, it doesn\\u2019t matter. I don\\u2019t like guns, right? I\\u2019m gonna say some things that are just facts, right? In Australia, we had guns, right? Right up until 1996. In 1996, Australia had the biggest massacre on Earth. It still hasn\\u2019t been beaten. And\\u2026 Now, after that, they banned the guns. Now, in the 10 years before Port Arthur, there was 10 massacres. Since the gun ban in 1996, there hasn\\u2019t been a single massacre since. I don\\u2019t know how or why this happened, uh\\u2026 Maybe it was a coincidence, right? Now, please understand that I understand that Australia and America are two vastly different cultures with different people, right? I get it. In Australia, we had the biggest massacre on Earth, and the Australian government went, \\u201cThat\\u2019s it! No more guns!\\u201d And we all went, \\u201cYeah, all right, then. That seems fair enough, really.\\u201d Now, in America, you had the Sandy Hook massacre where little, tiny children died, and your government went, \\u201cMaybe\\u2026 we\\u2019ll get rid of the big guns?\\u201d And 50% of you went, \\u201cFuck you! Don\\u2019t take my guns!\\u201d [Whooping] So, here\\u2019s where it gets confusing, right? Now, as I said, I am all for your Second Amendment rights. I think you should be able to have guns. It\\u2019s in your constitution. What I am not for is bullshit arguments and lies. There is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun, and this is the argument\\u2026 \\u201cFuck off. I like guns.\\u201d It\\u2019s not the best argument, but it\\u2019s all you\\u2019ve got. And there\\u2019s nothing wrong with it. There\\u2019s nothing wrong with saying, \\u201cI like something. Don\\u2019t take it away from me.\\u201d But don\\u2019t give me this other bullshit. The main one is, [In American accent] \\u201cI need it for protection. I need to protect me. I need to protect my family.\\u201d Really? Is that why they\\u2019re called \\u201cassault rifles\\u201d? Is it? I\\u2019ve never heard of these fucking \\u201cprotection rifles\\u201d you speak of. Protection? What the fuck are you talking about? You have a gun in your house, you\\u2019re 80% more likely to use that gun on yourself, than to shoot someone else. And people think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019d never happen to me.\\u201d You don\\u2019t know that, because you know what?\\n\\u266a From time to time We all get sad \\u266a \\n\\u266a One day you\\u2019re happy Then you\\u2019re sad \\u266a \\n\\u266a And then, uh-oh \\u266a\\nProtection. I had a break-in in Manchester, England, where I was tied up, I had my head cut. They threatened to rape my girlfriend. They came through the window with a machete and a hammer, and Americans always go, [In American accent] \\u201cWell, imagine if you had a gun.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAll right. I was naked at the time. I wasn\\u2019t wearing my holster. I wasn\\u2019t staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through.\\u201d What world do you live in where you\\u2019re constantly fucking ready? You have guns \\u2019cause you like guns! That\\u2019s why you go to gun conventions! That\\u2019s why you read gun magazines! None of you give a shit about home security. None of you go to home security conventions. None of you read Padlock Monthly. None of you have a Facebook picture of you behind a secure door going, \\u201cFucking yeah!\\u201d Like you\\u2019re going to be ready if someone comes into your house. You have it at all fucking times. By the way, most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking TV! You think that people are coming to murder your family? How many fucking enemies do you have? Jeez, you think a lot of yourself if you think everyone\\u2019s coming to murder you. See, if you have it readily available, it becomes unsafe. You have it in your bedside table, one of your kids picks it up, thinks it\\u2019s a toy, shoots another one of your kids. Happens every fucking day, but people go, \\u201cThat\\u2019d never happen in my house \\u2019cause I\\u2019m a responsible gun owner. I keep my guns locked in a safe.\\u201d Then they\\u2019re no fucking protection! Someone comes into the house, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cWait there, fuck-face! Oh! You\\u2019ve come to the wrong house here, buddy boy. I tell you what. I\\u2019m gonna fuck you up! Okay. Is it 32 to the left or 32 to the right? Your mother\\u2019s birthday? Why the fuck would I know your fucking mother\\u2019s birthday? Maybe if you didn\\u2019t leave the window open [In whining voice] \\u2018because it\\u2019s too hot in here,\\u2019 we wouldn\\u2019t be getting fucking murdered, right?\\u201d I find the NRA to be hard work. The fact that they always think the answer is more guns. After Sandy Hook happened, the NRA said, and I quote, \\u201cNone of this would have happened if the teachers had guns.\\u201d I\\u2026 I think they\\u2019re forgetting what school was like. Does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to\\u2026 Whenever she came into school, that relief teacher came, you and your friends would see her and go, [Chuckling] \\u201cOh, we\\u2019re gonna make her cry.\\u201d And then she\\u2019d stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking, and you\\u2019d go, \\u201cYou\\u2019re never getting married, are you, Miss? Never gonna happen for you.\\u201d Then she\\u2019d get back to her 1967 Volkswagen Beetle, and she\\u2019d be crying over the steering wheel, just, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t they like me?\\u201d Let\\u2019s give that cunt a gun and see how things work out! [Audience cheering] And then they go, \\u201cOh, well, answer to that, we\\u2019ll just add more guns.\\u201d They go, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll put an armed security guard at every school across America.\\u201d Yeah, that\\u2019ll work out. The average security guard in America earns $16 an hour. Not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero! Someone comes onto the school and\\u2026 [Mimicking machine gun] And you\\u2019ve got Kevin. Now, I\\u2019m sure Kevin\\u2019s shit-hot at Call of Duty, but it might not fucking cut it, ladies and gentlemen. Now, I understand that when I\\u2019m doing this joke in this room, 50% of you agree with me, 50% of you don\\u2019t agree with me, and I do respect the people who don\\u2019t agree with me. Don\\u2019t think I don\\u2019t. Out of the 50% that don\\u2019t agree with me, 20% of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and it\\u2019s not to be taken seriously, and they\\u2019re laughing along \\u2019cause it\\u2019s just funny jokes, right? And then the next 20%, have sort of phased out a little bit. They\\u2019re looking around, going, \\u201cWonder how they got that chandelier up there?\\u201d And then\\u2026 there\\u2019s the last 10%. And they\\u2019re fucking furious. Right now, in this room and the people watching at home\\u2026 10% of you are fucking seething. Just\\u2026 And for a couple of reasons. First reason, I\\u2019m making good points. [Audience cheering] Second reason. Second reason. Second reason, and this is the big one, I\\u2019m foreign\\u2026 and that\\u2019s pissing the fuck out of you right now, and your brain is on a loop and you can\\u2019t fucking turn it off, and it\\u2019s just going around in a circle, and you\\u2019re just going, \\u201cIf you don\\u2019t like it, go home! If you don\\u2019t like it, go home!\\u201d And my answer to that is, \\u201cNo.\\u201d I came here legally. I pay my taxes. I\\u2019ll say whatever the fuck I want. Your First Amendment means that I can say the Second Amendment sucks dicks. And\\u2026 unless you\\u2019re an American Indian, you\\u2019re a fucking immigrant as well, so fuck off. People get so precious about it. I understand that to Americans, your constitution is very important. I respect it, but please understand that every country has one as well. It\\u2019s no more special than any other constitution. We have one in Australia. I don\\u2019t know what it says. I\\u2019ve never seen it. If there\\u2019s a problem, we\\u2019ll check it, but everything\\u2019s going fine. And don\\u2019t get me wrong. I get that the constitution is important to you. I have had\\u2026 Fucking, I get it, right? I\\u2019ve had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as I\\u2019m leaving the theater, going, [In American accent] \\u201cYou cannot change the Second Amendment!\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, you can. It\\u2019s called an \\u2018amendment.'\\u201d If you can\\u2019t change something that\\u2019s called an \\u201camendment\\u201d, see, many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution. And if you don\\u2019t know what a thesaurus is, get a dictionary and work your way forward. Don\\u2019t think your constitution is set in stone. You\\u2019ve changed things before. You used to have prohibition in there, right? And then people were like, \\u201cHey, who likes getting fucked up? Yeah, I like getting fucked up, too. Let\\u2019s get that one out. Let\\u2019s get that one out.\\u201d You used to have this other thing in America called, uh\\u2026 slavery! And then Lincoln came along and went, \\u201cThat\\u2019s it. No more slaves!\\u201d And 50% of you went, \\u201cFuck you! Don\\u2019t take my slaves!\\u201d And the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns. \\u201cWhy should I have my slaves taken off me? I\\u2019m a responsible slave owner. I\\u2019m trained in how to use my slaves safely. Just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesn\\u2019t mean that my rights should be taken away from me. I\\u2026 I use my slaves to protect my family! I keep my slaves locked in a safe!\\u201d That\\u2019s the thing. \\u201cWhy should I have my guns taken off me? I\\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\\u201d Look, I agree with you. If you\\u2019re a responsible gun owner and you don\\u2019t fuck around with them, then you should be allowed your guns. You really should. But that\\u2019s not how society works. We have to play to the 1% that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us. We have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving, right? I take drugs like a fucking champion, right? [Audience cheering] We should all be allowed to take fucking drugs, but we can\\u2019t, can we? Because Sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids. Oh! \\u201cOh, thanks, Sarah. You fucked it up for everyone.\\u201d Right? Everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it, right? But we can\\u2019t because Jonathan got drunk and ran over a family. \\u201cThanks, Jonathan! Now I have to drive at 30, you fucking idiot!\\u201d See, that\\u2019s the thing. \\u201cWhy should I have my guns taken off me, I\\u2019m responsible, just because that guy\\u2019s crazy?\\u201d Who\\u2019s to say you\\u2019re not crazy? That\\u2019s the thing about crazy people. They don\\u2019t know they\\u2019re crazy. That\\u2019s what makes them crazy. The only thing you know for sure on this Earth is, \\u201cI think, therefore I am.\\u201d You know that you exist. Anything past that is open to interpretation, right? You know you exist and that\\u2019s it. Right now, I think I\\u2019m in Boston talking to 1,200 people. That\\u2019s what I think I\\u2019m doing, but there is a good to fair chance that I\\u2019m in a mental home, standing in front of a white wall, going, [Slurring speech] \\u201cI hate guns. I hate guns. I hate guns.\\u201d [Audience applauding] See, one of the better arguments is, \\u201cWell, if you take the guns away, then only the criminals will have guns.\\u201d Not true. When they banned the guns in Australia, it worked. When they banned them in Britain, it worked, okay? The Bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in Sandy Hook costs, like, $1,000 American and you can buy it in Walmart. It\\u2019ll be delivered to your house. That\\u2019s it, man. 1,000 bucks, right? That same gun in Australia on the black market costs $34,000. Now if you have $34,000, you don\\u2019t need to be a criminal. You\\u2019ve got $34,000. You\\u2019re a great little saver. Keep going. So that covers the criminals, but that doesn\\u2019t cover the people who wanna murder your family, that are coming after you and your family. It kind of does. The people who do the massacres, it covers them \\u2019cause they go\\u2026 The kid at Colorado who thought he was The Joker, let\\u2019s say that he had some social issues. The kid at Sandy Hook was Asperger\\u2019s as fuck. Right? I don\\u2019t know if you know a lot about the black market, but you can\\u2019t just rock up at the docks going, [Slurring speech] \\u201cGuns! Who wants to sell me a gun?\\u201d Now, I\\u2019m gonna wrap this up. We won\\u2019t talk about it anymore. Now\\u2026 See, the one thing that I do really agree with with the right to bear arms, I really agree with\\u2026 That the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government. In case the government became a bunch of cunts, you could all get your guns and fight back, and that\\u2019s why it was written. \\u2013 [Audience cheering] \\u2013 Yeah! And that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets. But you do know the government has drones, right? You get that? You\\u2019re bringing guns to a drone fight! If we went back to muskets, I\\u2019m all for it! Keep the Second Amendment. If we all have muskets\\u2026 Muskets are awesome! Every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times. You know what\\u2019s good about the musket? It gives you a lot of time to calm down. Someone calls your wife fat, and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cFuck you, buddy! Ah, you\\u2019re not a bad guy. You\\u2019re all right.\\u201d Now\\u2026 after the show, we\\u2019re gonna go out, have a big party around Boston, see how it goes. I\\u2019m not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore. My girlfriend has said that\\u2019s a no\\u2026 \\u2019cause I don\\u2019t behave myself in there, so I\\u2019m not allowed to go to them anymore. \\u2018Cause strip clubs aren\\u2019t what women think they are. [Stammers] It used to be like\\u2026 Okay, so, when a man goes to a strip club, it\\u2019s all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible. That\\u2019s what men want to see. Women, when they go to their Magic Mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are\\u2026 women wanna see a guy, \\u201cHey, ladies. He\\u2019s a fireman.\\u201d And he comes out with his hose and like that\\u2026 And whenever a stripper takes their clothes off, they\\u2019ve still got the fireman\\u2019s hat on or a tool belt on or policeman\\u2019s gun on a holster, right? Because even when a man\\u2019s naked, a woman wants to know that he has a job. When men watch strippers, we want them to have a job, and that job\\u2019s stripping. We want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money, and just go\\u2026 \\u201cYou can\\u2019t take care of your kids.\\u201d It\\u2019s\\u2026 And when men get private dances in these strip clubs, I don\\u2019t know\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms, but basically, it\\u2019s dry humping. There\\u2019s no dancing. The girl gets in front. She gets where your cock is, pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it\\u2026 and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face, and you go\\u2026 That\\u2019s what a private \\u201cdance\\u201d is, right? I don\\u2019t know if there\\u2019s private dancing in female strip clubs. [Stammering] I can\\u2019t imagine that there would be. I don\\u2019t imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going\\u2026 She goes, \\u201cHow was it?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cWell\\u2026 he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals\\u2026 and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead. I got to go to the ATM.\\u201d So Legit got canceled. [Audience booing] Yeah. I know. I know it. Who would\\u2019ve thought it would\\u2019ve struggled on that great FXX channel that everyone knew about? The first season is on Netflix. This special is being recorded for Netflix. So you can go watch it there if you\\u2019re watching the special. It was\\u2026 I\\u2019m very proud of it. We had two great seasons of really good television, and if people didn\\u2019t\\u2026 Now\\u2026 The whole TV show is based around one standup routine that I used to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that I took to a brothel, which is a true story. And so, when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who\\u2026 In the end, we used DJ Qualls, and DJ Qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie Road Trip. He\\u2019s the skinny white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow, and he\\u2019s the white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow. Now\\u2026 the great thing about DJ is\\u2026 he already looks disabled. He has that \\u201clatter stages of AIDS\\u201d thing going on. It\\u2019s great for casting. Anyway, but\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t want DJ to begin with. I wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic, and the Actors\\u2019 Union of America said, \\u201cYou cannot do that.\\u201d Because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy, I think, are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired. And I said, \\u201cAll right, what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer?\\u201d And they sent me a list. And on this list, I said, \\u201cCan you get rid of all the contagious ones? And what have we got left?\\u201d So I saw every disabled actor in Hollywood, and I\\u2019ll be honest with you, not that many of them. I don\\u2019t know why. Maybe they\\u2019re just lazy. They don\\u2019t wanna work. Maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly. And none of them were very good, either. Everyone we saw, none of them were very good \\u2019cause acting is all about what you do with your hands. None of them knew what to do with their hands, and\\u2026 they all came in. Until this one guy came in. I had seen a lot of people that day. This guy was the most disabled person I\\u2019d ever seen in my life. He was like\\u2026 Think of the most disabled person you\\u2019ve seen, then double it. \\u2026really super disabled. He was shaped like a pretzel. He was being carried in by this big Russian nurse, carried him in. He made that great disabled sound of\\u2026 [Groans] That one. I just loved him. Anyway\\u2026 so he comes in for the audition\\u2026 and I\\u2019m sitting there, and we\\u2019re doing the lines together, and at first, I didn\\u2019t know if he was mentally all there either, so I was being a little bit patronizing. I was going, \\u201cThank you so much for coming in.\\u201d And then we did the dialog together, and I didn\\u2019t have to worry about a thing. This kid was funny. He was smart. His timing was impeccable. I thought he was just great, and I helped him out of the room, and I come back to the director and I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s our guy. That\\u2019s who we gotta pick.\\u201d And he agreed, but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room. So the next bloke wheels himself in. Now, obviously, he\\u2019s just a paraplegic if he\\u2019s wheeling himself in, which means the waist down, and that didn\\u2019t really suit me because\\u2026 paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance. But I thought\\u2026 \\u201cIf he\\u2019s a good enough actor, maybe he can quad-up for the role.\\u201d So he comes in\\u2026 He comes in, I shake his hand, and his leg slightly comes out at the same time. And I went, \\u201cWhoa! What\\u2019s going on there, kicky?\\u201d And he goes\\u2026 \\u201cOh, you got me! I\\u2019m not disabled.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re fucking what now?\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cI\\u2019m not disabled. I just really wanted the role, so I rented a wheelchair.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cJust shut up. So let me\\u2026 This is how your day has mapped-out thus far. You woke up this morning. You drove to the wheelchair rental place. You rented a wheelchair. You carried it out, I assume. You put it in the trunk of your car. You drove here. You got the wheelchair out. You carried it up three flights of stairs. You went to the waiting room. You put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse. Then you sat in it and practiced your lines.\\u201d And he went\\u2026 \\u201cYeah.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re a fucking asshole, mate. Get the fuck out of here.\\u201d And I kicked him out. And later on that day, I\\u2019m sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors I\\u2019m gonna call to tell them they\\u2019ve got parts, and I\\u2019m holding this disabled guy\\u2019s headshot, and I just think, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna call this guy up. I\\u2019m gonna change his life. This is an awesome moment, right?\\u201d And I\\u2019m looking at it, and he looks super handsome in his headshot. He looked really like\\u2026 And I thought, \\u201cThis has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history.\\u201d The shutter on his camera has gotta be like\\u2026 [Mimicking camera shutter] Like\\u2026 [Audience applauding] And then I read the guy\\u2019s biography\\u2026 and then it dawned on me. \\u201cThis guy\\u2019s not disabled either! I hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair! This cunt rented a nurse!\\u201d Do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse? I\\u2019m all for a method actor. Get into character three hours before, but once you finish the audition, stand up and go, \\u201cTa-da!\\u201d And we would have gone, \\u201cThat was very good.\\u201d But I\\u2019ll tell you what you don\\u2019t do. Don\\u2019t make me carry you to your car! I carried him down three flights of stairs going, \\u201cYou did very good.\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cThank you, Jim.\\u201d [Laughing] [Chuckles] I was, uh\\u2026 I go to a therapist\\u2026 \\u2019cause I get depressed. So I got a therapist every now and again. I literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind.\\u201d Like just out of the movies, right? And she went, \\u201cRed,\\u201d and I went, \\u201cBlue.\\u201d And then she went, \\u201cCooking,\\u201d and I went, \\u201cFood,\\u201d and all that type of stuff. We went like this forever. And then she went\\u2026 For the last question, she went, \\u201cAnd what\\u2019s your favorite thing in the world?\\u201d And I went\\u2026 \\u201cComing on a girl\\u2019s face.\\u201d Now\\u2026 Now, I could\\u2019ve said things like\\u2026 \\u201cIce cream\\u201d is a good answer. \\u201cHank\\u201d would\\u2019ve been an excellent answer. But I said, \\u201cComing on a girl\\u2019s face.\\u201d And I\\u2019ve had six months to think about my answer, and I stand by it. \\u2013 I\\u2026 \\u2013 [Cheering] I\\u2019m not proud of it. I hate myself for thinking it. It\\u2019s such a horrible thing to do to another human. When a girl\\u2019s on her knees and you\\u2026 It\\u2019s so\\u2026 And as an atheist, I believe in Darwin and all the things that he wrote, but he never had a bit where he explained that. There was never a bit in his book where he went, \\u201cWhen a caveman loves a cavewoman, he\\u2019ll ejaculate on her face so that flies won\\u2019t come near.\\u201d There was never that\\u2026 never that moment. But, by golly, if it\\u2019s not fun. I find it\\u2026 To\\u2026 Look, to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time, may I say, \\u201cBravo!\\u201d Don\\u2019t\\u2026 don\\u2019t think what you do\\u2026 has gone unnoticed. We notice. We appreciate your work. I think you deserve a parade of some kind. During Memorial Day, after the Vietnam vets, before the First Gulf War guys, we could bring in, \\u201cAnd here\\u2019s the women who take a load on their face.\\u201d And you could march out, and married men would stand there going, \\u201cGod bless you, ladies.\\u201d [Audience cheering] I enjoy your acting that you do. The standard tongue out and the\\u2026 Like that\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know why, but I enjoy\\u2026 I know it\\u2019s a lie. I know you\\u2019re not excited, but I still appreciate the effort is what I enjoy. I love the look because it\\u2019s such a, \\u201cOh, jeez, I\\u2019m excited, too. When this come hits my face, there\\u2019s a good chance I\\u2019ll also orgasm. Anything could happen in this crazy world.\\u201d But this is what redeems us as men. This is what redeems us. Just know that the second the come shoots out of our cock and hits your face, our bodies flood with remorse. The next 20 seconds is the nicest we will ever be to you. [Men whooping] I go from being an animal to the sweetest guy on Earth. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou fucking slut\\u2026 Oh, I love you. Ah\\u2026 Uh, all right. No, no, no. Put your tongue back in. Um\\u2026 Keep your eyes shut. Just keep them shut. Uh\\u2026 All right, I\\u2019m going to get a towel. I\\u2019ll get a towel. I\\u2019ll get you a towel. All right. You\\u2019re a wonderful mother to our child.\\u201d [Laughs] [Audience cheering] See\\u2026 this is what kills me. My son will one day watch this DVD. And I\\u2019m the guy who\\u2019s meant to teach him right from wrong, and I\\u2019m there wiping come off his mother\\u2019s face. I think I did something illegal with my son the other day. I think it might be illegal. Tell me if this is illegal. All right? I\\u2019m in the shower. My girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning, and when she came back, I was in the shower, and Hank ran up, and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like, \\u201cArgh!\\u201d Like that. And I went\\u2026 [Vocalizing] And I saw his little face and I went, \\u201cHello, Hankie.\\u201d And then in the condensation, I drew a little bowtie on him\\u2026 and a little suit\\u2026 and then I gave him a voice bubble that said, \\u201cI love my daddy. Love, Hank.\\u201d But I did it so I could read it. Well, of course he could read the \\u201cK,\\u201d and\\u2026 then I stepped out. I stepped out of the bathroom and I went, \\u201cG\\u2019day, Hankie!\\u201d And he slapped my cock and he ran off. Now, is that illegal? I don\\u2019t know. Is it illegal because, A, a child touched my cock, or because, B, I found it really funny and I\\u2019ve been telling everyone. And I can\\u2019t get angry at him because his whole life, he\\u2019s been lying on mats with things dangling over. He\\u2019s been training for this his entire life. I think I\\u2019ve, uh\\u2026 I think I\\u2019ve become American, more American than I am Australian lately, and there was a moment where I tipped over where I went, \\u201cOh, I think like an American person now.\\u201d And I\\u2019m happy to do it. I just\\u2026 I\\u2019ll tell you what happened. I was flying around\\u2026 I was doing a tour of Australia, and I was flying domestically around Australia, and I\\u2019m so used to airports and stuff here in America that\\u2026 Okay, what happens is, when you go\\u2026 I was flying Sydney to Melbourne. When you fly domestically in Australia, you go up to the machine, put your name in, prints your ticket out, it prints your bag thing, you put the bag thing on your bag yourself, and then there\\u2019s a conveyor belt underneath. You throw your bag on. Bag fucks off. You don\\u2019t speak to anyone. Then I go up to the gate bit, and the lady\\u2019s going, \\u201cTickets, please.\\u201d And I\\u2019m holding my ID out like a fucking simpleton. \\u2018Cause I get through airports quick, man. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cFucking there you go.\\u201d And she went, \\u201cPut your ID away. I don\\u2019t need to see that.\\u201d And I went\\u2026 \\u201cI think you do.\\u201d And she went, \\u201cI don\\u2019t\\u2026 Why would I need to see your ID?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI might be a terrorist.\\u201d And she went, \\u201cWould showing me your ID stop you from blowing the plane up?\\u201d \\u201cNo, I\\u2019d probably still blow the plane up.\\u201d So then I get up to the TSA conveyor belt thing, and I\\u2019m so good at the airports. I\\u2019m already taking my shoes off as I\\u2019m walking, right? And all the Australians behind me assume that I\\u2019m American, and they\\u2019re losing their fucking shit. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, for fuck\\u2019s sake! One of these cunts, eh?\\u201d And the TSA guy goes, \\u201cHey, mate, what are you taking your shoes off for?\\u201d And I went\\u2026 [Shouting] \\u201cI don\\u2019t know! Maybe they\\u2019re bombs?\\u201d And he went\\u2026 \\u201cBut they\\u2019re not, are they?\\u201d I put me shoes back on. I get my laptop out. Everyone\\u2019s going mental. And the TSA guy says, very politely, but extraordinarily sarcastically, he goes, \\u201cJeez, mate. That\\u2019s a nice computer. Why are you showing it to everyone?\\u201d \\u201cIt might also be a bomb.\\u201d And then the guy said the most Australian thing I\\u2019ve ever heard come out of anyone\\u2019s mouth ever. He went\\u2026 \\u201cOh, come on, mate. You wouldn\\u2019t have two bombs.\\u201d [Audience laughing] [Chuckles] I\\u2019m not even quite sure what that means, but it does make some type of sense. All right. Oscar Pistorius. If you haven\\u2019t been following the case, you\\u2019re missing out. This is the greatest thing since OJ Simpson. You\\u2019re fucking missing out, mate. If you don\\u2019t know who Oscar Pistorius is, let me fill you in. Oscar Pistorius is a legless man from South Africa, known as the Blade Runner. He ran in two Olympics, the disabled and the able-bodied Olympics in one year. No one has ever done that. He\\u2019s an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and able-bodied people alike, and on Valentine\\u2019s Day last year, he shot and killed the hottest girl on Earth\\u2026 and that\\u2019s when he became an inspiration to me\\u2026 \\u2019cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long. Let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there. You can\\u2019t just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want. [Mock tearfully] People have feelings, you cunts. Now, there\\u2019s a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day. One of the theories is that they found in her phone\\u2026 He went through her phone, and on her phone, he found some text messages from a South African rugby player on Valentine\\u2019s Day, right? Now, I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever been to South Africa, but in South Africa, rugby is more popular than legless running. It goes, rugby, legless running, cricket. Legless running\\u2019s their second sport. You wouldn\\u2019t have thought that. Anyway\\u2026 I\\u2019m going to reenact what I believe happened that day. To do that, I will now be doing a South African accent. Now I know, many of you can\\u2019t tell the difference between my accent and a South African accent. Here\\u2019s the difference. Picture my accent, but I\\u2019m punching a black person. What I\\u2019m trying to say is South Africans are horrible people. So\\u2026 she\\u2019s coming out of the shower. She\\u2019s been drying her hair. She\\u2019s listening to Rodriguez or something. She comes out. He\\u2019s laying on the bed. He looks up at her, he\\u2019s holding the phone, and he goes, [In South African accent] \\u201cWhat the fuck is this? I\\u2019ve been through your phone. You have been texting a rugby player.\\u201d And she\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh! Fuck you! Who the fuck do you think you are?\\u201d \\u201cWho am I? I\\u2019m Oscar Pistorius, the greatest legless runner that has ever been. That\\u2019s who the fuck I am.\\u201d \\u201cWell, I would rather be with a rugby player. At least he is a whole man, not a three-quarter man like you.\\u201d \\u2013 [Audience exclaiming] \\u2013 I know. [Audience laughing] \\u201cOh! Fuck you!\\u201d \\u201cNo! Fuck you! I\\u2019m leaving you!\\u201d And then she storms out of the room, and then he was like\\u2026 \\u201cYou fucking bitch! [Grunts] I hate you! [Grunting] You will rue the day\\u2026 that you left Oscar Pistorius, the Blade Runner! Don\\u2019t go anywhere! [Grunting] I hate you!\\u201d That\\u2019s where he keeps his legs. All right. Then he put the blades on. \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re in trouble, missy. I tell you. I go to my gun safe.\\u201d She locked herself in the bathroom. He shot her through the bathroom door. Seems like overkill, doesn\\u2019t it? Bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them, but Oscar\\u2019s one of the few men on Earth that couldn\\u2019t kick the door in, right? He was wearing the blades, so\\u2026 Boing! Ah! So\\u2026 I think Oscar will probably go to prison. Now\\u2026 in South Africa, one in four people have AIDS. I assume it may even be worse in the prison population. Now, can I say this? Look\\u2026 I\\u2019ve never raped a man. I hate that I have to put \\u201ca man\\u201d in that sentence, but whatever. I\\u2019ve never raped a man, but\\u2026 if I was going to rape a man, it would be a legless Olympian\\u2026 \\u2019cause in prison, it\\u2019s all about getting one up on other people, and making people think you\\u2019re tough and all that. Like, \\u201cYou want to fucking rape me? I just raped an Olympian, bitch. Is that what you fucking want?\\u201d There\\u2019d be a wonderful moment\\u2026 when you\\u2019re in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a Terminator movie. [Chuckling] You know what I like about that joke? So often when you tell a joke, the rapist is the villain in the story, but not in that one. Not in that one. He\\u2019s the hero. All right, we have to get going soon. Before I leave, \\u2013 I thank you very much for coming. \\u2013 [Audience groaning] No, I said, \\u201csoon,\\u201d not \\u201cover.\\u201d It\\u2019s just soon, you cunts, so calm down. [Chuckles] [Man whistles] I always\\u2026 I always find that weird when someone, like, whistles like that. What do they think is going to happen? Like, I\\u2019m going to go, \\u201cFucking you know me, mate. I was enjoying claps and cheers, but what I needed was a high-pitched squeal noise. Thank God you came along to pick up my spirits.\\u201d [Man] Love you! All right, final story. Now, I was in South Africa again. Jeez, I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ll be working in South Africa after this special comes out. I used to do, like, one tour in South Africa every year, and I just don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019ll be invited this time. They\\u2019ll be like, [In South African accent] \\u201cWe don\\u2019t like him. He\\u2019s no good.\\u201d Anyway, so, I\\u2019m in South Africa, and I had to fly back from Cape Town to Los Angeles, which is, like, a 26-hour flight. You\\u2019ve to go up to London and go across. Cunt of a trip. Um\\u2026 But it was all right \\u2019cause I had a business class ticket, so I didn\\u2019t give a fuck. And when I travel economy, I try to dress up nice \\u2019cause I like to look good in case someone recognizes me and I might get an upgrade. But when I\\u2019ve already got a business class ticket, I try to look like a bag of shit\\u2026 \\u2019cause it\\u2019s important to me that everyone else in business class doesn\\u2019t want me there and they\\u2019re annoyed by my presence. So\\u2026 I\\u2019m wearing a white T-shirt that\\u2019s got brown stains on it with a hole in the side. I\\u2019m wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out. So, anyway, I go up to the counter, up to the business thing with the thing, and I go, \\u201cHello,\\u201d and the lady goes, [In South African accent] \\u201cOh, Mr. Jefferies, I\\u2019m so sorry, but you have been downgraded.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou what now?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cBusiness class is full. You have been downgraded.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI understand that business class is full. I bought one of the tickets that made it full.\\u201d And she went, \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, sir. There\\u2019s nothing I can do.\\u201d And then I just went, \\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\\u201d Now, you know when you\\u2019re dealing with customer service people, and they want you to swear, \\u2019cause as soon as you swear, they don\\u2019t have to engage with you anymore. They can act like they\\u2019re the first adult never to hear a swear word, and they can get really offended, right? So I went, \\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\\u201d And she went, \\u201cPlease do not speak to me that way! I have done nothing wrong!\\u201d And I said, \\u201cAre you, a white South African, telling me you\\u2019ve done nothing wrong?\\u201d Anyway\\u2026 tensions rose. The manager comes over. Big fat cunt called Simon Fulcher, right? He walks over and goes, [In South African accent] \\u201cWhat is wrong here? What is wrong?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI bought a business class ticket and I want a business class ticket.\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cWhat do you want me to do? Make a new chair for you? There are no more seats. I can\\u2019t do anything.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cI\\u2019ll tell you what I can do. Go up to the executive lounge. Have some peanuts. Enjoy a beverage. Listen to Rodriguez, and if something opens up, we will move you back up to business class. So I thought, \\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing I can do.\\u201d So I walk off with my ticket. I\\u2019m walking through the airport like, \\u201cFucking British Airways, bunch of fucking cunts.\\u201d Right? I get up to the counter. And the woman behind the counter said, \\u201cTickets, please.\\u201d And I hand over my ticket and she goes, [In South African accent] \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, sir, but this is for business class passengers only. Your ticket says \\u2018economy\\u2019 on it.\\u201d And I said\\u2026 [Inhales sharply] \\u201cI bought a business class ticket, but you people have downgraded\\u2026\\u201d And as I was doing my little speech, she looked past me and went, \\u201cNext.\\u201d [Audience exclaiming] \\u201cListen here, you fucking cunt.\\u201d [Audience laughing] All right? Now, you say \\u201ccunt\\u201d in any foreign country, people lose their fucking shit. Security came from everywhere. I was going, \\u201cDon\\u2019t you fucking come near me, cunt!\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI want to speak to Simon Fulcher,\\u201d like I\\u2019m\\u2026 And they go, \\u201cAll right.\\u201d They ring the manager up, and then they go\\u2026 He goes, \\u201cIs it the pale Australian man?\\u201d And the guy went, \\u201cYes.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve had problems with him. Let him through.\\u201d Right? So I go through. I\\u2019m sitting there, I\\u2019m eating my peanuts. And I\\u2019m just angry now, going, \\u201cFucking British Airways. Fucking cunts, fucking\\u2026\\u201d Like that. And in walks in a group of Americans, about 30 of them. You know the type, right? They all\\u2026 And whenever I see Americans abroad\\u2026 I\\u2019ll do my impersonation of any American abroad. When Americans are abroad, you\\u2019re just pointing out shit you see. You\\u2019re just walking around going, [In American accent] \\u201cOh, this is great! Look at that. That\\u2019s a chair right there. Okay. Oh, what\\u2019s that over there? Okay. Wonderful. Great.\\u201d Right? And this group walked in, and one of the women in the group went like this, she went, [In American accent] \\u201cDid anyone else see that Australian guy speaking to that lady out there? Some people have no class.\\u201d And I put my head around the pylon, and I went, \\u201cYou can fuck off and all! You don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019ve been through! I\\u2019ve been downgraded!\\u201d And as I said that, 18 other people who were given the same lie that I was given, that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class, the penny dropped. None of us are getting promoted. They all lied to us, and we formed an angry militia in seconds. It was like a scene out of Braveheart, and they all stood up and went, \\u201cFucking downgraded!\\u201d And the woman in the group was doing this, \\u201cDon\\u2019t speak to me that way. Who the hell do you think you are?\\u201d And all the men in the group were like, \\u201cHey, why don\\u2019t you shut the fuck up? Just shut the fuck up.\\u201d \\u266a It doesn\\u2019t matter These people seem very angry, so \\u266a And a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down. And, sometimes, Americans, sometimes, you can seem a little insincere. And he came up and he went, [In American accent] \\u201cHey. Hey. Yeah, I get it. [Exhales sharply] Downgraded, yeah. That really grinds my gears, I tell you that. Yeah, I would write a strongly-worded letter. I really would.\\u201d And then I thought, at least this guy\\u2019s being nice, and I said, \\u201cLook, mate, don\\u2019t worry about it. It\\u2019s not like it\\u2019s your fault.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cWhy are you in such a big group anyway?\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cOh, we\\u2019re in Neil Diamond\\u2019s band. That\\u2019s Neil Diamond\\u2019s backup singer you just called a cunt there.\\u201d And as he said that, Neil Diamond walked around the corner like a fucking superhero\\u2026 and I reacted like he was one. I went, \\u201cNeil Diamond!\\u201d And Neil Diamond went, [In husky voice] \\u201cHey, what\\u2019s going on?\\u201d And then, for a second there, there was a bit of my brain that thought maybe Neil Diamond could solve problems. And I went, \\u201cNeil! Me and all these people, we\\u2019ve been downgraded!\\u201d And Neil went, \\u201cOh! Oh, right. Uh, well, maybe that\\u2019s our fault. We decided to come back a day early.\\u201d \\u201cYou can fuck off and all, Neil Diamond!\\u201d And then a fight breaks out amongst the Neil Diamond band and the downgraded. Punches are thrown. Not by me. I don\\u2019t know if you have the Internet, but I\\u2019m not much of a fighter. I\\u2019m an excellent scurrier-awayer. I get down. \\u201cHey, what have you got there? Hiya!\\u201d Anyway, the airport police came. Three people were arrested from the downgraded\\u2026 but three people were arrested from the Neil Diamond band, and that meant that three seats opened up in business class.

Hi. Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, \\u2019cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming. Um\\u2026 It\\u2019s a very exciting day for me. It\\u2019s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought\\u2026 is \\u201cFuck you.\\u201d \\u201cFuck you. I don\\u2019t even know you, but fuck you!\\u201d \\u2018Cause I\\u2019m straight up jealous. I\\u2019m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there\\u2019s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through. And then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don\\u2019t have insomnia yet. They don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don\\u2019t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It\\u2019s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don\\u2019t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It\\u2019s coming. You don\\u2019t have HPV yet, you\\u2019re a fucking loser, all right? That\\u2019s what that says about you. A lot of men don\\u2019t know that they have HPV, because it\\u2019s undetectable in men. It\\u2019s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men\\u2019s bodies and says, \\u201cBoo!\\u201d in women\\u2019s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that\\u2019s gonna turn into cervical cancer\\u2026 \\u2026or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I\\u2019m gonna die\\u2026 or you\\u2019re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We\\u2019ll find out. Um, I can also tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I\\u2019m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I\\u2019m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that\\u2019s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That\\u2019s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I\\u2019m a horrible person, I\\u2019m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I\\u2019m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I\\u2019m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator\\u2019s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, \\u2019cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you\\u2019re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don\\u2019t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82\\u2026 manual. The manual. She don\\u2019t even know\\u2026 where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don\\u2019t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson\\u2019s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, \\u201cYou never know when you might need this.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cBut\\u2026 I do know\\u2026 that I\\u2019m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.\\u201d \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that\\u2019s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.\\u201d I grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I\\u2019m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They\\u2019re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he\\u2019s\\u2013 he\\u2019s much better looking than me, he\\u2019s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, who is that?\\u201d And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, I\\u2019m gonna trap his ass.\\u201d \\u201cGoing to trap his ass!\\u201d And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, \\u201cAll right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.\\u201d When, really, it\\u2019s a public park\\u2026 \\u2026that has hosted many reggae fests\\u2026 \\u2026and has even accidentally let\\u2026 two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing\\u2026 for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to\\u2026 It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had\\u2026 We had so much chemistry. He was like, \\u201cHey, wassup?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWassup?\\u201d And we\\u2013 The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, \\u201cHey, can you drop me off?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhere?\\u201d He was like, \\u201cAt the park.\\u201d And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, \\u201cOh, no!\\u201d \\u201cI just fucked a homeless dude! Again!\\u201d My husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It\\u2019s\\u2026 too much. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very\\u2026 You feel very picturesque when you\\u2019re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you\\u2019re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it\\u2019s very, you know, it\\u2019s hot hookin\\u2019 up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I\\u2019m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement\\u2026 \\u2026you know, just right there, through the money hole and just\\u2026 And then also, he\\u2019s so vulnerable down there. I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cI could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!\\u201d You know? But I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home\\u2026 and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don\\u2019t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It\\u2019s\\u2026 amazing. It\\u2019s what love is built on, you know? My last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, \\u201cHold it. You guys aren\\u2019t Mexican?\\u201d Asian-American men are very underrated. I don\\u2019t know why people don\\u2019t go for them. They\\u2019re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It\\u2019s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It\\u2019s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It\\u2019s all red and inflamed and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI did not ask to be exfoliated today.\\u201d \\u201cThis is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.\\u201d And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That\\u2019s where the umami flavor comes from. I think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he\\u2019s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we\\u2019re both half-fancy Asian\\u2026 \\u2026and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn\\u2019t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!\\u201d I was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not authentic, OK?\\u201d You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, \\u2019cause it don\\u2019t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused. I grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That\\u2019s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that\\u2019s like\\u2026 \\u2026a thousand percent of your daily fiber\\u2026 and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about\\u2026 \\u2026supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it\\u2019s funny, right, because he\\u2019s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do\\u2026 makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall\\u2026 and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house. Him and I had been dating for four years and I\\u2013 I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose\\u2026 because\\u2026 I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women\\u2019s intuition. That\\u2019s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man\\u2019s head. First passively and then if he doesn\\u2019t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you\\u2019re too old and it\\u2019s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, \\u201cShut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?\\u201d And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, \\u201cOh, my God! He proposed!\\u201d \\u201cIt came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something\\u2026 that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.\\u201d Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page\\u2026 he\\u2019s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday\\u2026 because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That\\u2019s how rotten I was. People are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I\\u2019m a completely different person. You\\u2013 Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I\\u2019m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We\\u2019ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I\\u2019ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he\\u2019d become dependent on me. \\u2018Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t. I straight up don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\\u2019ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she\\u2019s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don\\u2019t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re dumb women. We don\\u2019t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.\\u201d \\u201c\\u2018Cause we\\u2019re too stupid to have any real responsibility.\\u201d And then, all these women had to show off and be like, \\u201cWe could do it! We could do anything.\\u201d \\u201cBitch, shut up!\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t tell them the secret.\\u201d They ruined it for us, and now we\\u2019re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, \\u201cDouble-income household,\\u201d I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cBut, Ali, we have so many more options now.\\u201d Oh, you don\\u2019t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it? A lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they\\u2019ll get very judgmental about housewives that we\\u2019ll see on the street. And they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cLook at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat bitch is a genius.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s not a housewife, she\\u2019s retired.\\u201d I do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It\\u2019s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it\\u2019s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don\\u2019t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don\\u2019t gotta\\u2026 \\u2026ten times a day, every day\\u2026 like you\\u2019re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don\\u2019t gotta do that. They don\\u2019t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that\\u2019s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It\\u2019s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired \\u2019cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed \\u2019cause you\\u2019re paranoid that your co-worker\\u2019s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, no! Courtney\\u2019s listening. She\\u2019s waiting. She\\u2019s timing me.\\u201d And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it\\u2019s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don\\u2019t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don\\u2019t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don\\u2019t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want. You know, it\\u2019s\\u2013 it\\u2019s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, \\u201cYou need to get to work on time.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYou need to eat bananas.\\u201d \\u201cI saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don\\u2019t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.\\u201d My father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, \\u201cHey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhy you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don\\u2019t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, \\u2018I do,\\u2019 what I really meant was, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019m done.'\\u201d I\\u2019m done. I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore and I\\u2019m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I\\u2019ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That\\u2019s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just\\u2026 Let\\u2019s redecorate. I gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I\\u2019m a\\u2013 I\\u2019m a disgusting pervert. I\\u2019m a pervert. I\\u2019m a gross filthy animal. And I think it\\u2019s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that\\u2026 y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it\\u2019s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you. I broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, \\u201cUh, you\\u2019re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist\\u2026 and posted \\u2018Tiny Asian female seeking anal\\u2026\\u2019 the Internet would crash.\\u201d \\u201cAnd all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.\\u201d They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know\\u2026 freaked out about anal. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, I don\\u2019t wanna do that. I\\u2019m scared of\\u2013 of the pain.\\u201d You ain\\u2019t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You\\u2019re not scared of the pain. What you\\u2019re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You\\u2019re scared that he\\u2019s gonna see that and that\\u2019s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can\\u2019t help you now. But don\\u2019t worry, \\u2019cause when he puts it in the butt, all he\\u2019s thinking about is, \\u201cI just put it in her butt.\\u201d \\u201cI gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.\\u201d You\\u2019re\\u2013 If you\\u2019re married, you\\u2019re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don\\u2019t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you\\u2019ll feel like you\\u2019re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I\\u2019m a little bit\\u2026 \\u2026stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, \\u201cOh, my God! It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m going back in time!\\u201d \\u266a A whole new world \\u266a It was magical. A big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to\\u2026 Now, if you haven\\u2019t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your\\u2013 Just give your man a little\\u2013 a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you\\u2019ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You\\u2019ll get a lot of \\u201cNo! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don\\u2019t\\u2013 No! I don\\u2019t! I don\\u2019t! No!\\u201d They get all squirmy wormy because\\u2026 they\\u2019re scared. They\\u2019re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they\\u2019re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man\\u2019s eye like he\\u2019s discovered nirvana. And it\\u2019s like you\\u2019re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know? My husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When\\u2013 When I\\u2019ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. \\u201cHey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?\\u201d I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cYes, I know you respect me and that\\u2019s why you need to abuse me. OK?\\u201d \\u2018Cause it\\u2019s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their\\u2013 Glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 It\\u2019s because we\\u2019re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t wanna die! Don\\u2019t kill me! I don\\u2019t wanna die!\\u201d But I also don\\u2019t want to be sure that I\\u2019m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just\\u2013 Just choke me enough so that I can\\u2019t talk. \\u2018Cause if I can talk, I\\u2019m gonna tell you what to do. And I\\u2019m tired of being the boss. I\\u2019m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I\\u2019m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it. Sheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word \\u201cbossy\\u201d in elementary schools, because according to her, it\\u2019s sexist to use the word \\u201cbossy,\\u201d because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re bossy,\\u201d you\\u2019re supposed to say, \\u201cYou have executive leadership skills.\\u201d Which is a very roundabout way of saying: \\u201cYou\\u2019re a little cunt.\\u201d I\\u2019m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I\\u2019m talking about? I\\u2019m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That\\u2019s the kind of income bracket I\\u2019m striving for. That\\u2019s when you know you\\u2019ve made it, when you\\u2019re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango\\u2026 \\u2026Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess. I have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran. So, I don\\u2019t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It\\u2019s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics\\u2026 don\\u2019t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There\\u2019s\\u2013 None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That\\u2019s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they\\u2019ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cGuys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby\\u2019s a little piece of shit. It\\u2019s so annoying and boring.\\u201d And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s hilarious. I identify.\\u201d And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper \\u2019cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby\\u2019s head shredding it up. She\\u2019s busy. So, I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, \\u201cAli, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become\\u2013 You\\u2019re gonna disappear, and you\\u2019re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s the dream.\\u201d That\\u2019s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know? Another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, \\u201cWhy are you gonna have a kid? Why don\\u2019t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s cool\\u2026 until my husband dies.\\u201d Which he\\u2019s definitely gonna before me. Because I\\u2019m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I\\u2019m a billion. I\\u2019m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase \\u201cblack don\\u2019t crack.\\u201d Well, Asian don\\u2019t die. We don\\u2019t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we\\u2019re such bad drivers? Because we\\u2019re trying to die. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!\\u201d \\u201cImma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna make a right turn\\u2013 I changed my mind, it\\u2019s a U-turn!\\u201d \\u201cI changed my mind again. It\\u2019s a O-turn!\\u201d Every time I get into a car accident\\u2026 \\u2026I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, my God, not again!\\u201d I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn\\u2019t see that it\\u2019s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There\\u2019s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there\\u2019s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with me, but I\\u2019m still here, you know? I need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It\\u2019s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. \\u2018Cause she knows that she\\u2019s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I\\u2019m just kidding. She doesn\\u2019t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I\\u2019m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn\\u2019t around to support me anymore. I\\u2019m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That\\u2019s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don\\u2019t give a fuck. They got no shame. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna recycle\\u2026 go bald\\u2026 go to the park, do this shit.\\u201d They do that \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a free activity. For them. They do it in their\\u2013 their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who\\u2019s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity. I also decided to have a kid because uh, I\\u2019m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it\\u2013 And it scared me. Like, I\\u2019m only 33 and\\u2026 \\u2026my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It\\u2019s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just\\u2026 \\u201cI slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what kind of mother I\\u2019m gonna be. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that\\u2026 is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker\\u2019s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. \\u201cUh, mmm.\\u201d They watch Property Brothers, scratch, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s crackin\\u2019? Mmm.\\u201d Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, \\u201cWhen can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026smell my fingers?\\u201d Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, \\u2019cause you gotta check that it\\u2019s all good in the hood. If it\\u2019s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD. When my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, \\u201cOh, my God, that\\u2019s so hot. You guys doin\\u2019 a lot of fuckin\\u2019?\\u201d No, dude. That\\u2019s\\u2013 That\\u2019s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in\\u2013 When you\\u2019re in your 30s, and you\\u2019ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin\\u2019. It tells you when it\\u2019s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not fuckin\\u2019. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it\\u2019s like, \\u2018Release the Kraken!'\\u201d And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um\\u2026 yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn\\u2019t even have sex, \\u2019cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cOK, it\\u2019s go time,\\u201d and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s not because they\\u2019re in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s because they\\u2019re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn\\u2019t have to see the expression on my face that says, \\u201cPlease, hurry the fuck up.\\u201d And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It\\u2019s when they get that\\u2026 that stupid-ass look on their face\\u2026 \\u2026where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just\\u2026 And then, because we\\u2019re hippies, I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cHey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?\\u201d And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him\\u2026 and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards\\u2026 to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That\\u2019s right. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\\u2019m very grateful to be pregnant and to be\\u2026 this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, my God. That\\u2019s so dark and terrible. I can\\u2019t believe that.\\u201d I\\u2019m 33. Girl, when you\\u2019re 33, you\\u2019ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It\\u2019s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn\\u2019t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom\\u2013 She\\u2019s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, \\u201cUh, yeah. Where I\\u2019m from, that\\u2019s like losing a pair of shoes. It\\u2019s whatevs, OK?\\u201d And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, \\u201cOh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you\\u2019re having twins.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo!\\u201d And then she said, \\u201cBut what I don\\u2019t see is a heartbeat.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cYes!\\u201d \\u201cThe Lord is mysterious!\\u201d Don\\u2019t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I\\u2019ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won\\u2019t let their husbands watch when they\\u2019re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, \\u201cYou look.\\u201d \\u201cYou watch the whole thing.\\u201d And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyonc\\u00e9. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That\\u2019s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted. I\\u2019m scared about giving childbirth, though. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m very, very scared of childbirth. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That\\u2019s a white hippie witch\\u2026 \\u2026that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser S\\u00f6ze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, \\u201cAli, did you know that you\\u2019re gonna poop on the table?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, I look forward to it.\\u201d I\\u2019m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can\\u2019t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you\\u2013 that that happens because when you\\u2019re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that\\u2019s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That\\u2019s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn\\u2019t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. \\u201cHey, can you wash the dishes?\\u201d \\u201cNo!\\u201d \\u201cCan you water the plants?\\u201d \\u201cI am not doing jack shit anymore. I\\u2019m busy makin\\u2019 a eyeball, OK? Are you makin\\u2019 a foot? I didn\\u2019t think so. You change the channel.\\u201d I can already see how there\\u2019s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor\\u2019s appointments with me. \\u201cOh, my God. I can\\u2019t believe he comes to all your doctor\\u2019s appointments. He is so supportive.\\u201d Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I\\u2019m the star of the show. There\\u2019s nothing for the camera to see if I\\u2019m not there. But he\\u2019s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I\\u2019m a bad mommy. You know, I\\u2013 I\\u2013 I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I\\u2019m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis\\u2026 to keep him down so that he doesn\\u2019t believe that he\\u2019s worthy of another woman\\u2019s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don\\u2019t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn\\u2019t know that. I didn\\u2019t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big\\u2013 they get big, like fingers. Like, \\u201cYou, you. You owe me money, you.\\u201d My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I\\u2019m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it. Now that I\\u2019m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy\\u2019s all wet again. But it\\u2019s different. It\\u2019s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, \\u201cWhy is it different?\\u201d And I looked it up, and my pussy\\u2019s all wet again because my\\u2013 my body\\u2019s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That\\u2019s not the same. When it\\u2019s straight up soldier glue, when it\\u2019s Neosporin. So, you know, I\\u2013 I, in\\u2013 previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who\\u2019s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he\\u2019s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron\\u2019d my ass. And now, if I don\\u2019t work, we die. Why else do you think I\\u2019m performing seven and a half months pregnant? All right, I\\u2019ve been Ali Wong.

Thanks. Thank you, guys. Hey, Seattle. Nice to see you. Look at this. Look at us. We\\u2019re here. This is crazy. It\\u2019s insane. So about five years ago, pretty much everyone who I know started to get married, and that was strange for me because I don\\u2019t really believe in the idea of marriage. And that would have been fine, except I have a problem where sometimes when I think that I am right about something, it can be a real source of tension between me and the person I\\u2019m arguing with. And the reason it\\u2019s a source of tension is that I\\u2019m right. And so I remember distinctly talking to my friend Dana, and she goes, \\u201cWell, you don\\u2019t believe in marriage for you, but, of course, you believe in it for other people.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo, I think it\\u2019s insane, you know, for anyone.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cWhy?\\u201d\\nAnd I said, \\u201cWell, first of all, it just seems doomed.\\u201d You know, 50% of marriages end in divorce. That\\u2019s just first marriages, by the way. Second marriages, 60% to 62% end in divorce. Third marriages, 70% to 75% end in divorce. That\\u2019s a learning curve.\\nSecond of all, monogamy\\u2019s impossible, or at the very least, not a sure thing. When I say that, I think people assume that I\\u2019m implying that men are incapable of being faithful. I think women are just as incapable, but for more sophisticated reasons, you know. I mean, with men, we\\u2019re just really simple. We have a very simple sexuality. When I say that, my female friends are like, \\u201cWell, we like sex just as much as you do.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cSure, but it\\u2019s different.\\u201d And they say, \\u201cHow?\\u201d And I say, \\u201cHave you ever masturbated while driving a car?\\u201d\\nNumber three\\u2026 I\\u2019m never gonna be happy. Why would anyone want to be a part of that? I think that\\u2019s not brought up often enough. I, um, I didn\\u2019t know that would be the reaction. Oh, no, that\\u2019s the hopeful part. The, uh\\u2026 I had one ally in all this, which is my friend Andy, and he\\u2019s a comedian as well. Not only did we decide we weren\\u2019t gonna get married, we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married. Yeah, we were pretty good at it. Like, we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages, you know. We were\\u2026 we were pretty good. I mean, we weren\\u2019t like the best in the world. I\\u2019m sure there are better in Europe. But we were\\u2026 we were solid, you know. Like, so, like, for example, at point my friend Alex was about to get engaged. And so we just took him to dinner. And during dessert, we gave him a long, hard stare. We said, \\u201cAre you sure this is what you want to do?\\u201d And then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we weren\\u2019t friends anymore. So February 27, 2007, I\\u2019m at Andy\\u2019s house in Los Angeles. And earlier in the night, I got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone, and it was a bad one because I knew that I was right. And Andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation \\u2019cause he\\u2019s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether you\\u2019re right. He says stuff like, \\u201cShe sounds crazy.\\u201d Like, even if what she\\u2019s saying isn\\u2019t that crazy, like, you\\u2019d be like, \\u201cShe only eats whole wheat bagels.\\u201d He\\u2019d be like, \\u201cShe sounds crazy!\\u201d You\\u2019d be like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not even the crazy part!\\u201d You know. So I\\u2019m telling him about his argument. And he goes, \\u201cYou\\u2019re right.\\u201d I go, \\u201cI know. I\\u2019m right.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cYeah, you\\u2019re right.\\u201d I go, \\u201cI know I\\u2019m right. I got to tell her about this in the morning.\\u201d And I get in my rental car to head back to my hotel, and I\\u2019m driving out of Andy\\u2019s small road, and I\\u2019m t-boned! I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019re familiar with this term, uh\\u2026 This is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driver\\u2019s side at a 90-degree angle, like a t-bone steak. And in 1 1/2 seconds, I\\u2019m spun around, and I think I\\u2019m dead. No, wait, I\\u2019m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. And then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. I know. Let me tell you how this argument started. I met Jenny in St. Louis. My friend Andy and I were working for her company. They were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches, which is really my demographic. I, uh\\u2026 No, I was very nervous about this. I was actually kind of about to go onstage, and I was, like, scrawling notes on my napkin. A lot of times I\\u2019ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary. And Jenny looked at me, and she goes, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI\\u2019m writing my set list.\\u201d And then she goes, \\u201cI think it\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo, it won\\u2019t be fine.\\u201d And then she was like, \\u201cI think it will be okay.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cWhy do you think that?\\u201d And she said, \\u201cWell, you look so nervous, I think they\\u2019ll feel sorry for you.\\u201d But Jenny has this really soft, sweet voice, like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything. At one point, she said, \\u201cIt seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage.\\u201d Normally, I\\u2019d be offended by that, but in this instance, I was like, \\u201cYou are right. That is a great point. You are beautiful, you know.\\u201d She re\\u2026 she really was. You know, from the moment I met Jenny, I knew I wanted to sleep with her at least once. Stay with me. Uh, I mean\\u2026 I mean that in, like, in the most meaningful way. Like, that was the most that I was capable of in my life at that point. I\\u2026 I\\u2019d jus\\u2026 I\\u2019d just come off a really long, difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married, and\\u2026 and then we weren\\u2019t. And then when we weren\\u2019t, I was so heartbroken, I just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely, you know, and\\u2026 But from the moment I met Jenny, I just wanted to be with her. And I didn\\u2019t\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t think it was gonna happen. Like, I don\\u2019t have that kind of confidence. I actually think of myself as a sex maybe, which is to say that if I\\u2019m seeing a girl, she\\u2019d think, \\u201cI\\u2019d have sex with him, maybe.\\u201d You know, and I\\u2019m\\u2026 I\\u2019m not ashamed of that. There were periods in my life where I was a sex never. Or a sex with self always. Yeah. And often. Surprisingly often. Yeah, I just don\\u2019t give off a great first impression. Like, I\\u2019ll give you an example. Like, this is the shirt I decided to wear tonight. Like, I didn\\u2019t\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt. I mean, this is my \\u201cA\\u201d outfit. My \\u201cB\\u201d outfit was naked. I like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that I might be a fixer-upper. I\\u2019ve reached this point in my life I don\\u2019t really look in the mirror before I leave my apartment. I glance at it to make sure I\\u2019m not bleeding. You know what I mean? Like\\u2026 But I don\\u2019t stare at the mirror. If I stare at the mirror, I get angry. Like, I feel like I\\u2019m complaining about a bad call a ref just made. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cCome on!\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re blind if you\\u2019re leaving the house like that!\\u201d And the ref is God, and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline. And it\\u2019s a close game \\u2019cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast, and I\\u2019m all riled up. I\\u2019m about to charge the field. And the guy comes by with fried dough. And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNext time.\\u201d You know, that\\u2019s how I go for fried dough, \\u2019cause I have a problem. I just\\u2026 This is ridiculous. Can you follow me over here for a second? I\\u2019m gonna jump off stage. This is only in Seattle where someone is wearing no shoes? No shoes or socks? What? Who are you people? What is wrong with you? I would expect that behavior from this guy, but not you, sir, not you! What is this? Where do you think you are? From Seattle! Yeah, Seattle. So I\\u2019ve been going, uh, recently to a women\\u2019s exercise class. I-I\\u2019ve given up on having a traditional male physique. And so now I\\u2019m going for strong, independent woman. And, uh\\u2026 It\\u2019s going pretty well, you know. I\\u2019m not as good in the class as you might think. Sometimes I\\u2019ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isn\\u2019t looking. But then when she looks over, I always have to strike a pose as though I\\u2019ve been doing what everybody else has been doing. It reminds me of the Olympics. You know how they do gymnastics, how they\\u2019ll have those\\u2026 The girls will do those crazy flips and twirls. And every once in a while\\u2026 And I\\u2019m not saying I root for this to happen, but sometimes they\\u2019ll fall, and it\\u2019s ugly \\u2019cause they\\u2019re rolling around like, \\u201cI\\u2019m in a lot of trouble. Like, I don\\u2019t even know how I got here.\\u201d But at the end of that, no matter what\\u2026 And I totally fall for it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cthat can\\u2019t possibly be the same loser \\u201cFrom moments ago. \\u201cI mean, that\\u2019s a completely different person. \\u201cThis person has much better posture, for starters.\\u201d I really wanted Jenny to come out with me and Andy that night in St. Louis \\u2019cause we were going out to one of these famous Irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak. And so I thought that might work to my advantage. I don\\u2019t know, and, uh\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t have the nerve to ask her myself, and so I convinced Andy to ask her for us. And, uh\\u2026 Pfft. Which\\u2026 yeah, I don\\u2019t know if that was the best idea \\u2019cause, uh, we\\u2019re heading\\u2026 We\\u2019re in the car heading to the pub, and Jenny says, \\u201cOh, I left my I.D. at the hotel.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cOh, we can just swing back and get it.\\u201d And she\\u2019s like\\u2026 she\\u2019s like, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cNo, it won\\u2019t be fine \\u2019cause it\\u2019s St. Patrick\\u2019s day, and there\\u2019s bouncers.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019ll be okay.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo, it won\\u2019t be okay.\\u201d And then we get to the pub, and it was fine. Like, the bouncer just kind of waved her through, which has not been my experience with bouncers. For me, bouncers are like prison guards. And for Jenny, they\\u2019re like birthday clowns like, you know, \\u201cWhat can I do to make your day better?\\u201d\\nYou know, and that\\u2019s\\u2026 We\\u2019re at the pub, and it had taken so much convincing for Andy to get Jenny to come out there. By the time she came out, she thought she was on a date with him. And, yeah, that wasn\\u2019t the idea. And so I said\\u2026 I had to convince him to fall away as the night went on, like the red rockets on the space shuttle. And eventually, she realized she was on a date with me, and she was not happy about that. But, uh\\u2026 But she warmed to me as the night went on \\u2019cause she was drinking, and then, like\\u2026 No, by the end of the night, we were laughing and having a good time, and we\\u2026 I caught a break, which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends, and she and I were stuffed in this little back seat together. And it was really quiet, so I could hear her soft voice. And she told me she had just come off a long, difficult breakup, and I told her about my breakup. And for a moment there in the back seat, it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart, and\\u2026 We get back to the hotel, and I offer to walk her to her room, and she says, \\u201cSure.\\u201d We get to her door, and I didn\\u2019t want this night to end. And so I build up the courage to lean in to kiss her, and she says, \\u201cOh, no, thank you.\\u201d Which I thought was polite\\u2026 But disappointing. I mean, there\\u2019s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because you\\u2019re really putting yourself out there. You\\u2019re just like, \\u201cI think we should connect mouths,\\u201d you know, and\\u2026 The other person\\u2019s like, \\u201cI do not think we should connect mouths.\\u201d And those are\\u2026 They\\u2019re two very different mouth agendas, you know. And then you just feel so stupid. You\\u2019re like, \\u201cI never should have suggested we connect mouths, you know.\\u201d This is a sore subject for me. I have sort of a long history of failed kisses. Like, I\\u2026 I remember growing up, like, when people started making out. Like, in my time in Massachusetts, it was in seventh grade. I remember\\u2026 I remember it like it was yesterday \\u2019cause I was shocked. I was like, \\u201cPeople we know are just making out with other people we know?\\u201d \\u201cBut how?\\u201d You know. It seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden. I was like, \\u201cI am not doing that.\\u201d And collectively, all the girls in my class were like, \\u201cThat is fine. \\u201cYou are not on the list. \\u201cYou\\u2019re not exactly a first-round draft pick for our new activity.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cPerfect.\\u201d It seemed so gross to me. And it still does kind of. Like, sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t like when I see two dudes making out in the street.\\u201d And I feel that way about anyone. Like, making out is just sloppy. It\\u2019s like watching a dog eat spaghetti. That\\u2019s how I make out. Is that right? Does anybody know if that\\u2019s right? Okay, good. So\\u2026 In seventh grade, I was like, \\u201cI\\u2019m not gonna make out with anybody.\\u201d And that was fine for a while, but increasingly, it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts. It was like, the make-out club and the non-make-out club. And these were informal organizations, of course. I mean, I would be sad if that were school-sanctioned, like, \\u201cwe call this meeting of the non-make-out club to order. \\u201cFirst order of business, Nintendo. \\u201cSecond order of business, why doesn\\u2019t anyone like us? Meeting adjourned.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know, it was a sad group, and we were losing good guys by the day. I feared\\u2026 I feared that soon I would be the lone member of the non-make-out club, so I was like, \\u201cI got to try to get into the make-out club.\\u201d But it was a very intangible goal. I didn\\u2019t really talk to a lot of girls, and\\u2026 There was one girl who sat in front of me in class named Lisa Bazetti who I had a huge crush on, but she was way out of my league. Like, she had many suitors. She had\\u2026 I don\\u2019t\\u2026 The rest of the show is in old English. Uh\\u2026 She doth had many suitors! Uh, no, she had many, you know, admirers. And there were three of us, really, and I was in third place in all the trade publications, but I had one advantage over these other guys, which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework, thanks to alphabetical order. Bazetti, Birbiglia. One time I said something on the phone that made her laugh, and I was like, \\u201cOh, this is great. I got to do that more.\\u201d And one time we were on the phone, and she was laughing so hard, I remember so well \\u2019cause she goes, \\u201cMike, you got to stop. I\\u2019m gonna pee myself.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cWow.\\u201d This was the closest I\\u2019d ever come to a vagina. So spent the next 15 years trying to get Lisa Bazetti to pee. And that\\u2019s how I ended up here. Yeah. That\\u2019s how we all ended up here, in a sense. So\\u2026 uh\\u2026 So here\\u2019s what happened with Lisa. One time I built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me, and she said yes. I couldn\\u2019t believe it. Like, all of a sudden I thought, \\u201cWell, maybe this will be like \\u201cone of those romantic comedy montages. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll go to the carnival, we\\u2019ll get stuck \\u201cOn the top of the Ferris wheel, we\\u2019ll make out. \\u201cIt\\u2019ll all take a minute and a half, and it will be set to Phil Collins song.\\u201d But I think that when you\\u2019re 12 years old, you just don\\u2019t understand certain things about your digestive system. You don\\u2019t know that you shouldn\\u2019t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler. Cotton candy being the most insane of these items. It\\u2019s basically saying, \\u201cWe\\u2019re gonna take sugar, \\u201cwhich everyone knows is bad, but then we\\u2019ll dress it up like insulation.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure \\u201cwhat the selling point is there. Is it the sugar or the insulation?\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe already sold it.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cwell done, way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know if you have the scrambler here in Seattle. I imagine you might. It travels on a truck. It is a very mobile scrambling unit. The premise is very simple. You just sit on a two-person pod with the person you are in love with, and that pod goes in a circle, which is part of a larger circle, which is part of an even grander circle. As I understand it, it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients. It was called the \\u201cshits of pants-erator,\\u201d and it was wildly successful. And then it was co-opted by the carnival workers of America. Cwoa. And they said\\u2026 They said, \\u201cWe like it, but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff.\\u201d And then one guy says, \\u201cWell, what about the \\u2018I think I\\u2019m gonna die-erator\\u2019?\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s good, \\u201c\\u2019cause it gets across the essence of how you feel \\u201cwhen you\\u2019re on the machine. \\u201cPlus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea, \\u201cwhich is a nice homage \\u201cto the original intention of the machine, \\u201cbut we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff.\\u201d And then one guy goes, \\u201cwell, what about the scrambler? \\u2018Cause it scrambles you!\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe get it, Frank, but who\\u2026\\u201d Frank is a maniac. This guy can\\u2019t be stopped, but every once in a while, he\\u2019s got a good idea. \\u201cBut who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment?\\u201d And this one guy goes, \\u201cwell, I have a nephew who\\u2019s 16 years old \\u201cand smokes pot 24 hours a day. I feel like he might be available.\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201che sounds amazing. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t even need to interview him. He sounds completely qualified.\\u201d\\nI sit down with Lisa on the scrambler, and I\\u2019m feeling good. Like, she\\u2019s snuggling up close to me, and I\\u2019m thinking\\u2026 I\\u2019m thinking like, \\u201cthis could be it. \\u201cThis could be where it\\u2019s all gonna happen. This is very special.\\u201d And then they put that bar seat belt down. And the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment. It\\u2019s not a Ralph Nader approved item. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s saved lives. I think the only thing it\\u2019s ever done is in a scrambler accident, it\\u2019s just sort of held someone\\u2019s esophagus down to the pavement, making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident. First rule of scrambler accident, don\\u2019t talk about scrambler accident. That\\u2019s from scrambler club. Well, I knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that I was going to throw up for sure. And I even said to the 16-year-old stoner, I was like, \\u201chey, actually\\u2026\\u201d And then he was gone. Apparently, he doesn\\u2019t enjoy the second halves of sentences.\\nSo then I\\u2019m scrambling, and\\u2026 As I am scrambling, I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cI need to come up with a plan of some kind. I\\u2019m not going down without a fight.\\u201d My first plan was very simple. It was just don\\u2019t look at Lisa, don\\u2019t look at any other people. I was like, \\u201cdon\\u2019t look at Lisa, \\u201cdon\\u2019t look at any other people. \\u201cDon\\u2019t look at Lisa, \\u201cdon\\u2019t look at any other people. I need a new plan.\\u201d And\\u2026 The new plan was I needed to tell the scrambler operator\\u2026 That he needed to stop the ride, but\\u2026 The mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window. So I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI got to tell him he\\u2019s got to stop the ride. \\u201cI got to tell him he\\u2019s got to stop the ride. \\u201cI got to tell him he\\u2019s got to stop the ride. Please stop the ride!\\u201d And I\\u2019m back! \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure he heard me. \\u201cI got to say it louder. Please stop the ride! \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure he\\u2019s paying attention. I think he might be smoking pot right now.\\u201d The third time I said, \\u201cplease stop.\\u201d And then I started throwing up, and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler, just\\u2026 Popcorn, peanuts\\u2026 Insulation. Really, insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa. I did not look at Lisa. But I\\u2019m pretty sure she was staring at me because I was a spectacle at that point. I was spectacular. And we did not make out. I did not lose my mouth virginity that evening. Two years later, it gets worse. Um\\u2026 I\\u2019m at the St. John\\u2019s high school, what they call a cattle call dance. This is an all boys catholic school I attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty St. John\\u2019s gymnasium like cattle, which is a friendly way to describe women, you know. So\\u2026 Cattle shows up at 8:00. We\\u2019ll make out with the cattle. Cattle goes home at 10:00. Then we go out for burgers. Completely separate from the cattle analogy. It was a horrible affair. It was just like this room chock-full of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out. At this point, I was, indeed, the lone member of the non-make-out club, but it was actually worse than that \\u2019cause I had to lie to my friends and tell them I had had my first kiss \\u2019cause it was, like, this really tough, all boys school. And so when they would ask, like, \\u201coh, have you had your first kiss?\\u201d I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cyeah, like, all the time. Like, every\\u2026 every week.\\u201d I always feared at some point there\\u2019d be a follow-up question like, \\u201coh, yeah? What\\u2019s it like?\\u201d And I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cyeah, you know, it\\u2019s just like licking an ice cream cone.\\u201d And they\\u2019d be like, \\u201cno, it\\u2019s not. It\\u2019s like sucking on a rocket pop.\\u201d And I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cah, wrong frozen dessert analogy.\\u201d I\\u2019m at the dance, and I\\u2019m flanked by my friend Sam Ricciardi. And we\\u2019re introduced by our friend Tom to these girls from his town. They were the last two cows at the dance. They were like, \\u201cmoo!\\u201d And we were like, \\u201cmoo!\\u201d And then Sam says one of these phrases I think we\\u2019ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat. He says, \\u201cyou get that one.\\u201d Which I know it\\u2019s the worst turn of phrase, but I\\u2019m comfortable saying it \\u2019cause I know I\\u2019ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me, \\u201cyou get that one.\\u201d And then her friend goes like, \\u201coof.\\u201d You know, or even worse\\u2026 or even worse, like, \\u201cyou owe me,\\u201d which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance. I would hate to hurt someone\\u2019s credit score, you know. So he goes\\u2026 he goes, \\u201cyou get that one.\\u201d And then I\\u2019m just fast dancing with this girl, Sandra, to young mc\\u2019s bust a move. And I\\u2019m not great at fast dancing, but they had the strobe light going, so it\\u2019s only catching me one out of every five\\u2026 Hey! So she\\u2019s losing interest, but at 1/5 the speed. And then I\\u2019m saved by a slow song, Stairway to Heaven, which is a classic make-out anthem. Led Zeppelin, eight minutes long. What\\u2019s great about slow dancing is you can\\u2019t really mess it up \\u2019cause it\\u2019s just sort of a slow-motion hug. Like, the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it. She\\u2019d be like, \\u201cwhat are you doing?\\u201d And I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t pick up on social cues,\\u201d you know. But it\\u2019s such a long song, you know, Stairway, so I\\u2019m just trying not to fidget. I\\u2019m sort of a fidgety person. I feared if I fidgeted too much, I might initiate the head tilt too early. I didn\\u2019t know anything about making out, but I\\u2019d seen people do it. I could see there\\u2019s, like, a head tilt. I had heard there were tongues involved. And I could see that there was, like, some kind of space in between the two mouths. To me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing. What is happening in that space? There is no\\u2026 You know, there\\u2019s no video documentation of that area. It\\u2019s like the giant squid of making out. No one has seen it alive. They\\u2019ve only seen it washed up on the shore\\u2026 Which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy, but\\u2026 So I\\u2019m trying not to fidget. Then with 1 1/2 minutes left in stairway to heaven, the song hits that crescendo\\u2026 All around me, kids start to make the tilt. Just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me. And I was like, \\u201coh, no. I don\\u2019t want to be alone anymore.\\u201d And I make the slightest tilt. And then Sandra comes in strong, and then it\\u2019s an all-out mouth war. And she had artillery \\u2019cause she had braces. It was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork. As this oral atrocity is taking place, all I can think is, \\u201cI\\u2019m not alone anymore! I\\u2019m not in the non-make-out club!\\u201d And all I wanted to do was tell my friends, but I couldn\\u2019t because up until that point, I\\u2019d lied and said that I\\u2019d had my first kiss. I walked off the dance floor, Sam was like, \\u201chow\\u2019d it go, dude?\\u201d I had to be like, \\u201csame as always. Pretty smooth.\\u201d As the week wore on, I started to convince myself, \\u201cwell, maybe it did go well, \\u201cand I should call Sandra, and this could bud into a relationship of some kind,\\u201d but\\u2026 I got her number from Tom, and those conversations ended up being very brief, you know. We didn\\u2019t have a lot to talk about. I remember just being like, \\u201chey, you like full house? \\u201cMe neither. Cool. All right. Later.\\u201d You know what I mean? At certain points, I remember getting this vibe from her, kind of like, \\u201cwhy are you calling me?\\u201d And I remember thinking, \\u201coh, I\\u2019m probably reading into that one too much,\\u201d and\\u2026 And then she stopped calling me back. And I was like, \\u201coh, yeah, I read into that one perfectly.\\u201d But I just felt so dumb about the whole thing, and the worst part is I couldn\\u2019t even tell my friends, until one day I was\\u2026 I was standing by my locker with my friend Tom, and so I said to him, I was like, \\u201chey, what\\u2019s going on with Sandra? Like, she hasn\\u2019t called me back.\\u201d And Tom has this knowing grin on his face. I was like, \\u201cwhat?\\u201d Tom was like, \\u201cnothing.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cwhat?\\u201d Tom was like, \\u201cnothing.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cwhat?\\u201d Tom\\u2019s like, \\u201coh.\\u201d \\u201cI talked to Sandra, and she said \\u201cyou\\u2019re the worst kisser she\\u2019s ever kissed.\\u201d And it was so devastating \\u2019cause not only was it probably true, but I couldn\\u2019t explain to my friends why it was true. I couldn\\u2019t say, \\u201cthat makes sense. I\\u2019ve never done that before.\\u201d So instead I had to play it off. I had to be like, \\u201cyeah, that sounds about right. \\u201cI\\u2019m a terrible kisser. That\\u2019s kind of my thing.\\u201d So I lean in to kiss Jenny, and she says, \\u201coh, no, thank you.\\u201d She agrees to go out with me in New York. We were both living in New York, and she gave me her number, and I typed it in my phone, and from that point on, she would be \\u201cJen, Irish pub, nice.\\u201d A few weeks later, I took her out to a restaurant I couldn\\u2019t afford to show her how much money I could put on my credit card. We\\u2019re out to dinner, and she says to me, she goes, \\u201ceveryone hates me at work,\\u201d and I said, \\u201cwhy would they hate you? I love you.\\u201d She goes, \\u201cyou love me?\\u201d I go, \\u201cI mean, you seem cool.\\u201d I pulled it back. I didn\\u2019t want to show all my cards. Just about nine of them. One of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said, \\u201cyou know, sometimes I\\u2019ll date two people at once, and that way I\\u2019m never let down by either person.\\u201d I said, \\u201cthat seems like a really smart plan. Like, I\\u2019d like to do that as well.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cI\\u2019m still kind of seeing my ex-boyfriend, John, and you can see other people too, but you have to tell me if you\\u2019re seeing them.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201call right, sounds like a plan. \\u201cGot it. Break! I got to go find some more people, you know.\\u201d And so a few nights later, I\\u2019m in another city, and I do a show, and after the show, I went out to a bar, and I ended up making out with this random girl. Then a few nights later, I\\u2019m out to dinner with Jenny, and she says, \\u201chow was your trip?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cit was great. I did some shows, \\u201cand then one night I ended up making out with this random girl.\\u201d And that didn\\u2019t go over very well in the conversation. I could sense that something was wrong. And I was like, \\u201cbut I\\u2019m right about that, right? Like, I\\u2019m supposed to tell you if that happens, right?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cyeah, but it doesn\\u2019t mean \\u201cthat I won\\u2019t lose interest in you.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cthat\\u2019s a whole new clause! \\u201cThat\\u2019s a twist! What is this, the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects?\\u201d I said, \\u201care you still seeing John?\\u201d And she said, \\u201csometimes.\\u201d I said, \\u201cwell, don\\u2019t you see the contradiction in that?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cyes.\\u201d And it gets very quiet\\u2026 Because we were falling in love. Three weeks into my relationship with Jenny, I built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to Bermuda. I wanted to show her how much more money I could put on my credit card. Since I didn\\u2019t have a lot left, we went to Bermuda \\u2019cause it was the off season. You can get these great deals online. Because as it turns out, when it\\u2019s winter in New York, it is also winter\\u2026 In Bermuda, and, uh\\u2026 Jenny and I meet up at the airport, and she\\u2019s late, which is a big pet peeve of mine. I fancy myself as a professional traveler. I\\u2019m always two hours early, I have my pocket for my ticket and my passport, and I have laceless moccasins. I never tell jokes about bombs. And\\u2026 and Jenny\\u2019s late. And then we get to security, and I\\u2019m not making this up, she doesn\\u2019t have a license or a passport. And I said, \\u201cwhat do you mean?\\u201d I go, \\u201chow do you travel?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cwell, \\u201cusually, they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work I.D.\\u201d I don\\u2019t like to dwell on the differences between men and women, but I just can\\u2019t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport, and they would let him on the plane. But women get a pass on things like this that I find completely bewildering. I mean, if I were in charge of Al-Qaeda, for example, what\\u2026 what I would do is I would recruit attractive women because they\\u2019re just not stopped under any circumstances. Although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the 72 virgins and, you know, the women wouldn\\u2019t want that, unless they\\u2019re lesbians, although there\\u2019s an idea, you know. Al-Qaeda\\u2026 Al-Qaeda could recruit hot lesbians, although\\u2026 then they\\u2019d have to guarantee that the 72 virgins are also lesbians. I mean, what are the odds, you know? All 72 virgins are also lesbians, unless you think of sexuality as, like, a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity. Like the 72 virgins are like, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t even know I was a lesbian \\u201cuntil I had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist. \\u201cAnd now that\\u2019s all I\\u2019m into. \\u201cI used to be into these Afghani guys who are so crazy, \\u201cthey\\u2019d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me \\u201cand 71 of my friends. But now I don\\u2019t see Khalid in the same way anymore.\\u201d The point is, we went to Bermuda, and we\\u2019re on the flight\\u2026 On the flight, and the flight attendant comes over, and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us. And she says, \\u201ccongratulations on your honeymoon.\\u201d And we said, \\u201coh, no, thanks. We\\u2019re not on our honeymoon.\\u201d And she walks away, and Jenny says, \\u201cthat\\u2019s so funny. I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ll ever go on a honeymoon.\\u201d And I said, \\u201coh, really?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cyeah. I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019d ever want to get married in my life.\\u201d And I said, \\u201coh, really?\\u201d I go, \\u201cme too.\\u201d I said, \\u201cis that based on a principle, \\u201cor did you have a bad relationship? Like, what was your first boyfriend like?\\u201d And\\u2026 She told me about her first boyfriend Brian. It was\\u2026 they were at the same bus stop when they were 16, and they would make out on the bus, and they were together for six years. And they\\u2026 you know, their relationship got deeper, and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together. And I said, \\u201cthen what?\\u201d And she said, \\u201che died. He had leukemia.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, do you ever talk about this with anyone?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cno, I don\\u2019t really like to talk about it.\\u201d But these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where Jenny was opening up to me, and I was opening up to her. And every night we\\u2019d be up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and we were so happy, we\\u2026 At one point, I was like, \\u201cwell, we should do this again. \\u201cWe should go on another trip. And you could get a license or a passport.\\u201d Jenny said, \\u201cthat sounds great, \\u201cbut I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019d get a license or a passport \\u2019cause they don\\u2019t make me get one.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cyeah, but it\\u2019s the law.\\u201d You know. Jenny says, \\u201cyeah, I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ll get one \\u201c\\u2019cause they don\\u2019t make me get one, you know. That\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d That\\u2019s how Jenny argues things. Sometimes she\\u2019ll just say, \\u201cthat\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d And I\\u2019ll say, \\u201cthat\\u2019s not an argument.\\u201d \\u201cLike, we\\u2019re not even in an argument right now because you don\\u2019t have an argument.\\u201d And she\\u2019ll say, \\u201cI just won that argument.\\u201d And I\\u2019ll say, \\u201cthat\\u2019s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is.\\u201d And she\\u2019ll say, \\u201cI just won that argument,\\u201d again. \\u201cThat\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d You could see how this could be a little bit maddening, you know, uh\\u2026 On our final day on the trip, we got into an argument about essentially nothing. She noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel, and she said, \\u201cwe should play.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cyeah, but not, like, a game.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cwhy?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, \\u2019cause I\\u2019d win.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cno, I think I would win.\\u201d I go, \\u201cno. I know that I\\u2019d win, \\u201cand I know that what I\\u2019m supposed to say is that\\u2026 \\u201cThe guy says, \\u2018I\\u2019ll win,\\u2019 the girl says, \\u2018I\\u2019ll win,\\u2019 \\u201cand the guy lets her win, and then she likes him more. But I just don\\u2019t have that in me.\\u201d And Jenny goes, \\u201cyou don\\u2019t have to let me win. Let\\u2019s go out and play.\\u201d And so we went out and played basketball, and I just kicked her ass. I mean, it was just like\\u2026 It was just like\\u2026 10 to 1, you know, 11 to 1. I mean, I was having a good day, but still, I was just destroying her. And at one point, she literally said, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never met someone who\\u2019s so obsessed with the score.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cthe score is what makes it a game!\\u201d So we\\u2019re arguing this over lunch, and then, again, it comes up at dinner, and then we\\u2019re still arguing about it at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning about essentially nothing. And she said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t understand why you\\u2019re so obsessed with being right.\\u201d I go, \\u201cI\\u2019m not obsessed with it. I just am.\\u201d I said, \\u201cwhy do you think you\\u2019re right?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cthat\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d I said, \\u201cif you think I\\u2019m so wrong about everything, why are you even with me?\\u201d And Jenny says, \\u201cyou can\\u2019t choose who you love.\\u201d Which is true, but it doesn\\u2019t mean it\\u2019s good. I remember the first time I fell in love, I was in high school, and it was that first time where you fall in love, and you\\u2019re just like, \\u201cthis is it. I found her. I\\u2019m 17 years old, and I\\u2019m done, you know.\\u201d And\\u2026 Her name was Amanda, and she was, like, adorable and funny. And what was really exciting for me was that she was, like, a delinquent. Like, I was like this play-by-the-rules school citizen, and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid, which I thought was a really strong quality. Like, at one point, she was like, \\u201cit was totally messed up because it wasn\\u2019t even me. It was this other girl, and I was framed.\\u201d And I was just like, \\u201cawesome.\\u201d Like no one would ever frame me for anything. I just\\u2026 I thought it was like an opposites attract situation. She wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper. And I wanted to know what it was like to be cool. At one point, I was like, \\u201cdo you want to write an article for the newspaper?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to write an article. I want to do things people write articles about.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cgood answer.\\u201d\\nI find that when you fall in love, you tend to overlook certain red flags. One of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me, but then she would pull it back. She\\u2019d be like, \\u201cno one likes you at all. Only kidding.\\u201d Or, like, \\u201cyou\\u2019re like a nerd, but you\\u2019re not even smart. Just joking.\\u201d Can\\u2019t choose who you love.\\nSecond red flag with Amanda was that she was a liar. And I don\\u2019t\\u2026 I don\\u2019t mean that in an offensive way. Like, lying was kind of like a\\u2026 It\\u2019s like a sport at the school I was at. I transferred from the all boys school to this co-ed school. There was this one guy in my class named Keith Robbins who was a legendary liar. You\\u2019d know when he was lying \\u2019cause he would lick his finger like a bookie, and he would dart his eyes from side to side. And he\\u2019d go, \\u201cyeah, yeah, nice. Nice, you know.\\u201d And he wasn\\u2019t even handling money. Like, I don\\u2019t even know what this is about. And then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant. He\\u2019d be like, \\u201cyeah, my uncle\\u2019s Tony Robbins, \\u201cmotivational speaker. Yeah, nice, you know.\\u201d And\\u2026 We found out that that wasn\\u2019t even true. But even if that were true, that wouldn\\u2019t be impressive to a bunch of high school students. But I think that\\u2019s the jedi level of lying, is you lie about little stuff, and no one notices when you\\u2019re lying about big stuff. It\\u2019s like banking.\\nThe final red flag with Amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend. I know. I\\u2019m in the future also. I think we can all see now \\u2019cause we\\u2019re so smart, and Mike\\u2019s so dumb, and, uh\\u2026 You know, I can also see, in retrospect, that\\u2019s a much bigger red flag than I perceived it to be at the time, but I was so excited she was even with me at all. And she said she had another boyfriend at home, but they were in the process of breaking up, but it was a bad time \\u2019cause his parents were sick. And so I tried to be understanding of that. You know, I went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents. And I thought, \\u201cwell, this is the affirmation that I need. I\\u2019m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend.\\u201d And I drive my mom\\u2019s station wagon to Amanda\\u2019s parents\\u2019 house, and I walk in the front door, and there\\u2019s Amanda, and there\\u2019s her parents, and it\\u2019s going well. And a few hours go by, and this other guy comes over to the house, and his name is Scott. I\\u2019m assuming he\\u2019s, like, a family friend or a relative. And slowly I\\u2019m noticing similarities between Scott and things that Amanda has said about her other boyfriend. They\\u2019re both in their first year in college, and they\\u2019re competitive wrestlers, and\\u2026 It\\u2019s dawning on me that I\\u2019m hanging out with my girlfriend\\u2019s boyfriend. And it\\u2019s going pretty well. I mean, he\\u2026 He seemed like a nice guy. I could totally see what she saw in him. There was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom, she would hold on to my hand, and she would say, \\u201cI wish it were just you and me here.\\u201d And I remember thinking, \\u201cyou could make that happen.\\u201d The way she said it was as though she weren\\u2019t involved in the decision process, like, \\u201cI\\u2019d love to, but the boys in corporate\\u2026\\u201d\\nWell, the day took an even stranger turn when Scott suggested that we go hang out at his house. And I met his parents. It is indescribable meeting your girlfriend\\u2019s boyfriend\\u2019s parents for the first time. Part of you is angry for obvious reasons, but then part of you still wants to make a good impression. You know, you\\u2019re like\\u2026 \\u201cMaybe if this goes well, she\\u2019ll see that I\\u2019m good with adults in general!\\u201d As a side note, his parents seemed in perfect health. At one point, his dad even said to me, \\u201chow do you know Amanda?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwe\\u2019re just friends from school.\\u201d And I was so ashamed, and I felt so dumb. And I drove home, and I remember thinking, \\u201cI am never gonna let this happen to me again.\\u201d So\\u2026 Ten months into my relationship with Jenny, she invites me to meet her parents. And this was a tricky time. At this point, our relationship was intense, but casual, which is a dangerous relationship cocktail, and it was a hard thing to organize \\u2019cause I was away probably five days out of the week. And so we found a Sunday where I was coming back from a five-day stint in Texas, which was awful \\u2019cause it was\\u2026 In Texas. And I\\u2026 that\\u2019s\\u2026 That\\u2019s not to say I dislike Texas entirely. It\\u2019s such a large thing to dislike. And, uh\\u2026 But that week it felt like Texas just disliked me, and I just kind of disliked Texas back to the point where I developed a small drinking problem, which is\\u2026 which is very popular in Texas. I was performing at a comedy club. Now, comedy\\u2026 I love comedy clubs \\u2019cause they\\u2019re sort of a high-low entertainment proposition. Like, in some ways, though, they\\u2019re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word, and then some of them sell dildo straws, you know. Like, there\\u2019s 15 bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends, and they\\u2019re handing out gummy penises or whatever. That\\u2019s\\u2026 that\\u2019s actually a thing. I didn\\u2019t even realize that\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was\\u2026 was the gummy quality of the penis. I feel like if I were in charge of the candification of the penis, it would be hard candy. And then if\\u2026 And then, if you suck it down to the gummy part, then you just sort of put that off to the side. But I\\u2026 but that\\u2019s\\u2026 that\\u2019s not my job. I\\u2019m\\u2026 you know, I leave that to the experts, but I just\\u2026 I just do the comedy part. But I was performing at this club all week, and after the late show Saturday night, I was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things. And\\u2026 I\\u2019d been drinking all week, and, uh, I always try to be a team player, you know. So I was like, \\u201cwhatever I can do to help. I don\\u2019t see how this could end badly.\\u201d And, uh\\u2026 The next morning, I wake up in the my hotel room, and I\\u2019m hung over, and I\\u2019m groggy. And I roll out of bed, and I run to the airport to catch my flight. I\\u2019m still two hours early, and\\u2026 I land in New York, and I get a cab to Jenny\\u2019s parents\\u2019 house. And I walk in the front door, and there\\u2019s Jenny, and there\\u2019s her parents. And there\\u2019s her other sort of ex-boyfriend, John. And he wasn\\u2019t front and center. Like, he was just kind of around, like, he was in the pool, like, wading and doing laps, like, that kind of thing. But I pulled Jenny aside, I was like, \\u201cwell, what\\u2019s John doing here?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cwell, he and I aren\\u2019t still together, \\u201cbut when we were together, \\u201che became friends with my stepdad, \\u201cand he\\u2019s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cyou know, that\\u2019s not good. I feel like that gives him the edge.\\u201d Jenny\\u2019s staring at me. And I said, \\u201cwhat?\\u201d She says, \\u201cyou have a hickey on your neck.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s true.\\u201d And then I glance at the mirror next to me and realize that, in fact, I do have a hickey on my neck. And I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry.\\u201d And she says, \\u201cwhere is that from?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cthere was this bachelorette party, and I was drunk.\\u201d That sentence never comes out right. I mean, there\\u2019s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay, and\\u2026 We start arguing, and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment. I didn\\u2019t have a leg to stand on. I was like, \\u201cwell, what about John? What was he doing there?\\u201d She said, \\u201cyou have a hickey on your neck.\\u201d I said, \\u201cyeah, but at least I told you the truth.\\u201d And she said, \\u201ceventually.\\u201d And I said, \\u201ceventually is better than never!\\u201d And then she kneed me in the balls. I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever experienced this before. I\\u2019m sure half of you have not. Uh\\u2026 It\\u2019s like being electrocuted, except you don\\u2019t get to die. It\\u2019s like you want to die, but you can\\u2019t. And there\\u2019s a person in your face saying, \\u201cyou deserve this,\\u201d which they wouldn\\u2019t even do in electrocutions. I think they would deem that as inhumane.\\u00a0 Even in Texas.\\nJenny says, \\u201cI think that we should just break up. \\u201cYou know, it\\u2019s not just this. \\u201cI mean, you\\u2019re away a lot of the time. \\u201cAnd even when you\\u2019re here, you work at night, \\u201cand I work in the day. I just don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s gonna work out.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cokay.\\u201d\\u00a0 And we were apart for about six months, and I missed her so much, but I kept resisting calling her \\u2019cause I wanted to give her space. And every once in a while I\\u2019d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from \\u201cJen, Irish pub, nice.\\u201d And it would just say, \\u201chi.\\u201d And I\\u2019d write back, \\u201chi.\\u201d It was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another, but I think, in some ways, kept us together. And finally, on new year\\u2019s, I caved in, and I called her, I said, \\u201chey, I really miss you, and I want to see you.\\u201d And we got together for coffee. And we hit it off just like we used to, and we decided we would get back together. We had a great period there, you know. I took her to get a license and a passport. First, we went for her social security card, and then we took that to the D.M.V. And then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport. It was like the triple crown of identifications. Jenny was wildly identifiable. One night, she was heading back from my apartment to hers, and she stops. And I said, \\u201cwhat?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cI think that we should live together.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno, I really don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s a good idea. \\u201cYou know, I\\u2019ve just decided, you know, as a principle, \\u201cI\\u2019m not gonna get married or live with someone. It\\u2019s not personal.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cwell, unless we live together, \\u201cI just don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s gonna work out \\u201c\\u2019cause we just don\\u2019t see each other enough, \\u201cand I don\\u2019t think that we stand a chance. That\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d So we moved in together. And one day, Jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends, and she invites me to come along. And I said, \\u201coh, no, thanks.\\u201d That doesn\\u2019t go over so well. She says, \\u201cwhy?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, as you know, \\u201cI don\\u2019t believe in marriage, and so I don\\u2019t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it.\\u201d She said, \\u201cwell, what do you believe in?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\u201d She said, \\u201cwell, if you don\\u2019t believe in anything, how can you not believe in marriage?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, first of all, \\u201cyou know, it just doesn\\u2019t seem necessary. \\u201cI mean, is it\\u2026 you know, \\u201cmarriage is an archaic institution \\u201cinvented in the middle ages based on exchanging property. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to be a part of that. \\u201cSecond of all, I don\\u2019t even think we have \\u201ca common cultural understanding of what marriage even is. \\u201cI mean, one of me and Andy\\u2019s friends \\u201cwas about to get engaged, and we were skeptical, \\u201cand we said, \\u2018are you sure this is the person \\u201cyou want to be with for the rest of your life?\\u2019 \\u201cand he goes, \\u2018yeah, I think so.\\u2019 \\u201cand we said, \\u2018well, what if she gets in a car accident, \\u201cand she\\u2019s disfigured? Would you stay with her then?\\u2019 \\u201cand he said, \\u2018maybe\\u2019! \\u201cThat is not an acceptable answer! \\u201cThird of all, if I\\u2019m so in love, \\u201cwhy does it need to be written into a government contract? \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m not one of these like, \\u201c\\u2018I don\\u2019t want government up in my business\\u2019 kind of people! \\u201cI think the government does a nice job \\u201cdelivering the mail and suggesting I don\\u2019t eat poison, \\u201cbut I just don\\u2019t understand why they need to be involved \\u201cin my personal relationships. \\u201cThen finally, if marriage is religious, \\u201cshouldn\\u2019t I believe in the religion? \\u201cI\\u2019ve been to more weddings of my friends \\u201cwhere the people on the altar don\\u2019t believe \\u201cin the religion of the church they\\u2019ve invited us to! \\u201cSome of them even go to classes with the priest \\u201cin advance, to more elaborately lie \\u201cabout believing in a religion they don\\u2019t believe in \\u201cjust to have a wedding in a fancy building! \\u201cThat is insane! That\\u2019s how I feel!\\u201d So I explain this to Jenny. And Jenny says, \\u201cwell, if you ever did want to get married, I would marry you.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwhy? Aren\\u2019t you listening to any of this?\\u201d And Jenny says, \\u201cthat\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d At this point, it was 5:00 in the morning, we\\u2019d been arguing all night, and we hadn\\u2019t slept. I had to catch a flight at 6:20 A.M. Out of Newark airport to Los Angeles for a show I was doing that night. At this point, I\\u2019m overtired, and I\\u2019m angry, and I\\u2019m late. I\\u2019m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase. And I walk out of our apartment. It\\u2019s 5:00 A.M., that part of the morning before the earth even exists, before they program The Matrix or whatever. You walk out of your apartment, part of the road isn\\u2019t even there. There\\u2019s a guy with a laptop going, \\u201cwe need a road, stat! What\\u2019s the code for building, tank?\\u201d You know, and I get to the airport. The news hasn\\u2019t even started yet. It\\u2019s just an anchor looking around like, \\u201cwhat are you up to?\\u201d And I get to the kiosk, and I print up my ticket, and I bring it to the security lady, and she looks at me, and she goes, \\u201cwell, that ain\\u2019t your gate.\\u201d Like, I guess they changed the gate, but the way she said it was as though I had participated in the decision of changing it. I was like, \\u201cI was not involved in this process. I wasn\\u2019t even C.C.\\u2019d.\\u201d Like, as though I had gone to the kiosk and been like, \\u201cB22. Like hell I\\u2019m flying out of B22.\\u201d And then I photoshopped my own ticket, printed it out, and been like, \\u201cthis is where I\\u2019m going.\\u201d You know, I\\u2019m not that aggressive as a traveler, so I was like, \\u201cwell, where is this gate?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cit\\u2019s in another terminal. You got to take a tram.\\u201d She points to the tram, and I start walking my roller suitcase, and I hear her say, \\u201cand you better run.\\u201d Like, I guess I was late at that point. So I started running. And the roller suitcase does not enjoy running. The roller suitcase was like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to run. I have wheels.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to run either, but this is what we have to do. \\u201cI tell you what, when we get to the hotel, I\\u2019ll walk you in circles for a few hours.\\u201d Then I\\u2026 I get to the tram, and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives. And it says zero minutes. I was like, \\u201cperfect. That\\u2019s exactly how long I want to wait.\\u201d But the tram\\u2019s riding away. I was like, \\u201cthat\\u2019s -1 minute!\\u201d Then it says ten minutes, and I\\u2019m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like, \\u201coh, great, I\\u2019m gonna miss my flight, \\u201cand then I\\u2019m gonna miss every flight from now on, \\u201cand I\\u2019m gonna miss my family reunion. \\u201cAnd then I\\u2019m not gonna have a family, and then I\\u2019m gonna be a crack whore.\\u201d And it\\u2019s like, all of a sudden, I\\u2019m a crack whore just because I miss this one flight. I can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and\\u2026\\nI get on the next tram ten minutes later, and I run to the gate, and I\\u2019m sweaty, and I\\u2019m out of breath, but I\\u2019m on time. And I\\u2019m so relieved that I sit down in a chair at the gate, and I fall asleep. And I wake up to the sound of the door shutting. I jump up, and the door is closed, and I am on the sad side of the door. The happy side has an airplane and a pilot. The sad side is me and the Cinnabon lady. Normally, I\\u2019d be very excited if it were just me and the Cinnabon lady. I\\u2019m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year. I think that\\u2019s an effective use of time. But in this instance, I needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane. And the Cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community. I was like, \\u201cdo you know these people?\\u201d She was like, \\u201call I know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun.\\u201d I ran up to the giant glass window. I started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy. I was like, \\u201cDrew Barrymore\\u2019s character, come back!\\u201d She didn\\u2019t come back, and I missed my flight. I got on the next one they could get me on. There was a stopover in Texas. You know how I feel about Texas. And, uh, I get to Los Angeles late that night, and I\\u2019d missed my show. I\\u2019d never missed one of my shows before, and I\\u2019m so angry. And Jenny\\u2019s calling me, but I\\u2019m not picking up the phone \\u2019cause I\\u2019m blaming this entire day on her. I get back to my friend Andy\\u2019s house, and I said, \\u201cAndy, this relationship is messing up my entire life!\\u201d And Andy goes, \\u201cyou\\u2019re right.\\u201d I go, \\u201cI know! I\\u2019m right!\\u201d He goes, \\u201cyeah, you\\u2019re right.\\u201d I go, \\u201cI know, I\\u2019m right! I got to tell her about this in the morning!\\u201d I drive out of Andy\\u2019s small road, and I\\u2019m t-boned. That\\u2019s the culinary way of describing it. In 1 1/2 seconds, I\\u2019m spun around, and I think I\\u2019m dead. No, wait, I\\u2019m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. Then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. 20 minutes later I\\u2019m sitting on a curb. At this point, the police have arri\\u2026 have arrived, as well as my friend, Andy, and that\\u2019s when I start crying. You know how when you drop a baby on the ground, it doesn\\u2019t\\u2026 Doesn\\u2019t start crying right away because it doesn\\u2019t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face? And then it\\u2019s like, \\u201coh, I guess I should be doing something \\u201cthat matches that. Waah!\\u201d I\\u2019m crying because I\\u2019m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that, in that moment, I might have ceased to exist. Like I said earlier, I don\\u2019t really believe in anything, so in my mind, that would have been the end of all things I\\u2019d experienced in my life. Every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion, and\\u2026 The officer comes over, and he says, \\u201cwhat happened?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI got hit by this car, \\u201cand then I heard nothing, and then I heard the other car skid out and drive away.\\u201d The officer points over to the light. The other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree. I can\\u2019t help but think, \\u201cthat\\u2019s karma. That\\u2019s a hit and run and hit.\\u201d And then the officer puts this form in my face, and he goes, \\u201csign this.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, what does it mean?\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cit means you\\u2019re okay and that we can leave.\\u201d I was really shaken up. I was like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m okay.\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cjust sign it,\\u201d which is a very unattractive quality. When someone just repeats a command that you\\u2019ve just said no to, and it\\u2019s unattractive, but very effective, you know. I signed it. Andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution, but we have to wait two hours \\u2019cause the other driver had beat us there, and\\u2026 Eventually, we\\u2019re with the doctor, and Andy says to him, he goes, \\u201cwell, was the other guy drunk?\\u201d And the doctor says, \\u201cwell, I can\\u2019t answer that.\\u201d And Andy says, \\u201cwas he?\\u201d He uses the technique we had learned earlier, and it works, you know. The doctor says, \\u201cwell, he\\u2019s heading to jail now.\\u201d And Andy and I flash each other a look like the hardy boys, like, \\u201ccase closed.\\u201d A few hours later, we\\u2019re back at Andy\\u2019s house, it\\u2019s probably around 3:30 in the morning, and I have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have near-death experiences. I say, \\u201cI need to call Jenny and tell her that we need to get married.\\u201d And Andy says, \\u201cMike\\u2026 Sleep on it.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno, no, no, this makes perfect sense.\\u201d And I pick up my phone, and I dial her number. And he puts his hand over the phone, and he says, \\u201cMike\\u2026 Sleep on it.\\u201d He saves me. The next morning, I fly back to New York, and a few weeks later, I get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that I just described. And it had found me at fault and that I owed\\u2026 And I\\u2019m not making this up\\u2026 $12,000 for the repairs on the other driver\\u2019s Mercedes S.U.V. And I was like, \\u201cwell, this can\\u2019t be happening.\\u201d I explained to the woman, \\u201cI think it\\u2019s a misunderstanding. \\u201cThe other guy was clearly drunk. It was definitely not my fault.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry, but unless they change the accident report, you owe this money.\\u201d So I requested the accident report, and I\\u2019m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight. I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever seen one of these things before\\u2026 But it\\u2019s a little bit like homework for cops. And officer timson not so good with the homework. He consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two, vehicle one and vehicle two. At one point, so badly that he says P-1\\u2026 that\\u2019s me\\u2026 started to go, but all of a sudden V-1\\u2026 That\\u2019s me also\\u2026 Came at a high rate of speed, crashing into him. Now, I\\u2019m pretty self-destructive as a person, but I would never crash into my own car with my own car, nor would I understand how you could do that. This part is even crazier. The other driver\\u2019s statement at the scene of the accident was, \\u201cI was on Venice going\\u2026 uh, I\\u2019m not too sure. \\u201cI was going away from the beach. \\u201cI was driving. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what happened. \\u201cDid I hurt anyone? \\u201cI don\\u2019t know where I was going, \\u201cbut I came from home. I had a sip of beer.\\u201d Which is really everyone\\u2019s favorite quantity of beer. Just the one sip, right? That\\u2019s what they serve these days at the home/beach/pub.\\nSo all of it\\u2019s mine. The officer makes one key mistake. He checks the box that finds me at fault. So I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI need to get officer Timson on the phone, so we can clear up this misunderstanding.\\u201d The problem is he keeps ducking my calls, and I know \\u2019cause I\\u2019m calling two or three times a day, leaving messages, calling departments next to his department, so he knows I\\u2019m trying to reach him. And finally, after a month of this, I get him on the phone, and I\\u2019m so relieved. And I explain this misunderstanding. And he listens to me, and he says, \\u201cdo the right thing, and pay for the guy\\u2019s car.\\u201d I know, and, I mean, that\\u2019s what I said. I go, \\u201caren\\u2019t you listening to any of this?\\u201d I go, \\u201cand this guy was clearly drunk. \\u201cI mean, he nearly killed me. \\u201cInches from where he hit, \\u201cand I would be dead right now. \\u201cAnd he wants me to pay for his car? \\u201cDon\\u2019t you see how crazy that is, just as one human being to another?\\u201d And he says, \\u201cdo the right thing, and pay for the guy\\u2019s car.\\u201d And he hangs up the phone. And at this point, this stops being about money, and it\\u2019s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law. This is Chinatown! So I started printing up Google maps of the scene of the accident and California state driving law. I\\u2019m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators. There\\u2019s only one lawyer who would consider the case. And he was an accident lawyer, and he said, \\u201cdid you have any loss of income from the accident?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno,\\u201d and he says, \\u201cdid you have any loss of income from the accident?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno. This isn\\u2019t about money.\\u201d And he doesn\\u2019t take the case, and this is when I start going completely mad.\\nI\\u2019m up to about 4:00 or 5:00 A.M. every night just surfing the web. I get a subscription to a site called netdetective.com, which is a great site for vigilantes who have $29.95. So now I know this guy\\u2019s name, I know where he lives, I know what he does for a living. And in my mind, it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller. Like, \\u201cJim Bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this, \\u201cbut Jim Bosworth had another thing coming: Mike Birbiglia.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna track down Jim Bosworth. \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna sue Jim Bosworth, and I\\u2019m gonna sue the entire Los Angeles police department!\\u201d At this point, people stopped talking to me entirely. My friends would call me like, \\u201chey, what\\u2019s going on?\\u201d I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cI\\u2019ll tell you what\\u2019s going on!\\u201d I\\u2019d tell them this whole story. And they\\u2019d be like, \\u201cyou should get a lawyer.\\u201d I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cthis is way past lawyers! A lawyer wouldn\\u2019t even touch this!\\u201d \\u2018Cause he wouldn\\u2019t.\\nThe only person who would talk to me at this point was Jenny. One night, we were out to dinner at a restaurant, and she\\u2019s talking to me, but I\\u2019m not listening \\u2019cause I\\u2019m writing down ideas I have for the case on my napkin. I\\u2019ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection, and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in, the laws the other driver broke, and the phone numbers I\\u2019m gonna call that week. And I\\u2019m so angry, I\\u2019m writing over my own handwriting to the point where I\\u2019m ripping through the napkin. And Jenny looks at me, and she says, \\u201cwhat are you doing?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, this is my case.\\u201d And she says, \\u201cwell, why don\\u2019t you work on that in the morning?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, which part of this napkin don\\u2019t you understand?\\u201d Jenny says, \\u201cMike\\u2026 \\u201cYou\\u2019re right, \\u201cbut it\\u2019s only hurting you, \\u201cand I\\u2019m just so glad that you\\u2019re alive, and I think that we should focus on that.\\u201d She only has to say it once, and I give up the case, and I pay for this guy\\u2019s car. July 7, 2007, Jenny and I went to city hall and got married. I still didn\\u2019t believe in the idea of marriage, and I still don\\u2019t. But I believe in her, and I\\u2019ve given up on the idea of being right. Thank you guys very much. Thank you. Thank you guys so much!

              "\"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage: Ali Wong! Hi. Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, ’cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming. Um… It’s a very exciting day for me. It’s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I’m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought… is “Fuck you.” “Fuck you. I don’t even know you, but fuck you!” ‘Cause I’m straight up jealous. I’m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there’s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through. And then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don’t have insomnia yet. They don’t know what it’s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don’t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It’s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don’t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It’s coming. You don’t have HPV yet, you’re a fucking loser, all right? That’s what that says about you. A lot of men don’t know that they have HPV, because it’s undetectable in men. It’s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men’s bodies and says, “Boo!” in women’s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that’s gonna turn into cervical cancer… …or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I’m gonna die… or you’re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We’ll find out. Um, I can also tell that I’m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I’m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I’m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that’s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That’s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I’m a horrible person, I’m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I’m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I’m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator’s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, ’cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you’re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don’t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82… manual. The manual. She don’t even know… where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don’t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson’s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, “You never know when you might need this.” And I was like, “But… I do know… that I’m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.” “And I’m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that’s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.” I grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I’m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They’re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he’s– he’s much better looking than me, he’s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, “Oh, my God, who is that?” And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, “Oh, my God, I’m gonna trap his ass.” “Going to trap his ass!” And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, “All right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.” When, really, it’s a public park… …that has hosted many reggae fests… …and has even accidentally let… two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing… for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to… It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had… We had so much chemistry. He was like, “Hey, wassup?” I was like, “Wassup?” And we– The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, “Hey, can you drop me off?” I was like, “Where?” He was like, “At the park.” And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, “Oh, no!” “I just fucked a homeless dude! Again!” My husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It’s… too much. I don’t know what’s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very… You feel very picturesque when you’re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you’re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it’s very, you know, it’s hot hookin’ up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I’m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement… …you know, just right there, through the money hole and just… And then also, he’s so vulnerable down there. I’m, like, “I could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!” You know? But I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home… and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don’t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It’s… amazing. It’s what love is built on, you know? My last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, “Hold it. You guys aren’t Mexican?” Asian-American men are very underrated. I don’t know why people don’t go for them. They’re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It’s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It’s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It’s all red and inflamed and you’re like, “I did not ask to be exfoliated today.” “This is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.” And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That’s where the umami flavor comes from. I think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he’s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we’re both half-fancy Asian… …and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It’s… It’s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn’t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, “It’s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!” I was like, “It’s not authentic, OK?” You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, ’cause it don’t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused. I grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That’s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that’s like… …a thousand percent of your daily fiber… and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about… …supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it’s funny, right, because he’s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do… makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall… and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We’re like, “Oh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house. Him and I had been dating for four years and I– I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose… because… I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women’s intuition. That’s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man’s head. First passively and then if he doesn’t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you’re too old and it’s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you’re like, “I’m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, “Shut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?” And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, “Oh, my God! He proposed!” “It came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something… that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.” Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page… he’s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday… because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That’s how rotten I was. People are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I’m a completely different person. You– Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I’m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We’ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I’ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he’d become dependent on me. ‘Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t. I straight up don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she’s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don’t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, “We’re dumb women. We don’t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.” “‘Cause we’re too stupid to have any real responsibility.” And then, all these women had to show off and be like, “We could do it! We could do anything.” “Bitch, shut up!” “Don’t tell them the secret.” They ruined it for us, and now we’re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, “Double-income household,” I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they’re like, “But, Ali, we have so many more options now.” Oh, you don’t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it? A lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they’ll get very judgmental about housewives that we’ll see on the street. And they’ll be like, “Look at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.” I’m like, “That bitch is a genius.” “She’s not a housewife, she’s retired.” I do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is… It’s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It’s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it’s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don’t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don’t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don’t gotta… …ten times a day, every day… like you’re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don’t gotta do that. They don’t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that’s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It’s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired ’cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed ’cause you’re paranoid that your co-worker’s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you’re like, “Oh, no! Courtney’s listening. She’s waiting. She’s timing me.” And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it’s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don’t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don’t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don’t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don’t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want. You know, it’s– it’s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, “You need to get to work on time.” I was like, “You need to eat bananas.” “I saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don’t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.” My father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, “Hey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.” I was like, “Why you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don’t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, ‘I do,’ what I really meant was, ‘Oh, I’m done.'” I’m done. I don’t wanna work anymore and I’m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I’ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That’s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just… Let’s redecorate. I gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I’m a– I’m a disgusting pervert. I’m a pervert. I’m a gross filthy animal. And I think it’s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that… y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it’s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you. I broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, “Uh, you’re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist… and posted ‘Tiny Asian female seeking anal…’ the Internet would crash.” “And all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.” They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know… freaked out about anal. And they’re like, “Oh, I don’t wanna do that. I’m scared of– of the pain.” You ain’t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You’re not scared of the pain. What you’re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You’re scared that he’s gonna see that and that’s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can’t help you now. But don’t worry, ’cause when he puts it in the butt, all he’s thinking about is, “I just put it in her butt.” “I gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.” You’re– If you’re married, you’re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don’t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you’ll feel like you’re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I’m a little bit… …stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, “Oh, my God! It’s like I’m going back in time!” ♪ A whole new world ♪ It was magical. A big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to… Now, if you haven’t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your– Just give your man a little– a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you’ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You’ll get a lot of “No! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don’t– No! I don’t! I don’t! No!” They get all squirmy wormy because… they’re scared. They’re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they’re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man’s eye like he’s discovered nirvana. And it’s like you’re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know? My husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When– When I’ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. “Hey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?” I’m, like, “Yes, I know you respect me and that’s why you need to abuse me. OK?” ‘Cause it’s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their– Glasses always means the woman wants some– It’s because we’re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, “I don’t wanna die! Don’t kill me! I don’t wanna die!” But I also don’t want to be sure that I’m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just– Just choke me enough so that I can’t talk. ‘Cause if I can talk, I’m gonna tell you what to do. And I’m tired of being the boss. I’m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I’m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it. Sheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word “bossy” in elementary schools, because according to her, it’s sexist to use the word “bossy,” because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, “You’re bossy,” you’re supposed to say, “You have executive leadership skills.” Which is a very roundabout way of saying: “You’re a little cunt.” I’m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I’m talking about? I’m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That’s the kind of income bracket I’m striving for. That’s when you know you’ve made it, when you’re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango… …Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess. I have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran. So, I don’t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It’s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics… don’t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There’s– None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That’s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they’ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they’ll be like, “Guys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby’s a little piece of shit. It’s so annoying and boring.” And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, “That’s hilarious. I identify.” And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper ’cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby’s head shredding it up. She’s busy. So, I don’t know what’s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, “Ali, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become– You’re gonna disappear, and you’re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s the dream.” That’s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know? Another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, “Why are you gonna have a kid? Why don’t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s cool… until my husband dies.” Which he’s definitely gonna before me. Because I’m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I’m a billion. I’m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase “black don’t crack.” Well, Asian don’t die. We don’t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we’re such bad drivers? Because we’re trying to die. We’re like, “Yeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!” “Imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.” “I’m gonna make a right turn– I changed my mind, it’s a U-turn!” “I changed my mind again. It’s a O-turn!” Every time I get into a car accident… …I’m like, “Oh, my God, not again!” I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn’t see that it’s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There’s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there’s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I’m still here, you know? I need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It’s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. ‘Cause she knows that she’s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I’m just kidding. She doesn’t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I’m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn’t around to support me anymore. I’m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That’s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don’t give a fuck. They got no shame. They’re like, “I’m just gonna recycle… go bald… go to the park, do this shit.” They do that ’cause it’s a free activity. For them. They do it in their– their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who’s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity. I also decided to have a kid because uh, I’m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it– And it scared me. Like, I’m only 33 and… …my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It’s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just… “I slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!” I don’t know what kind of mother I’m gonna be. I’m– I’m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that… is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker’s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. “Uh, mmm.” They watch Property Brothers, scratch, “What’s crackin’? Mmm.” Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, “When can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to…” “…smell my fingers?” Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, ’cause you gotta check that it’s all good in the hood. If it’s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD. When my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, “Oh, my God, that’s so hot. You guys doin’ a lot of fuckin’?” No, dude. That’s– That’s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in– When you’re in your 30s, and you’ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin’. It tells you when it’s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, “We’re not fuckin’. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it’s like, ‘Release the Kraken!'” And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um… yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn’t even have sex, ’cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I’d be like, “OK, it’s go time,” and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s not because they’re in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s because they’re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn’t have to see the expression on my face that says, “Please, hurry the fuck up.” And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It’s when they get that… that stupid-ass look on their face… …where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just… And then, because we’re hippies, I’d be like, “Hey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?” And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him… and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards… to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That’s right. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’m very grateful to be pregnant and to be… this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They’re like, “Oh, my God. That’s so dark and terrible. I can’t believe that.” I’m 33. Girl, when you’re 33, you’ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It’s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn’t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom– She’s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, “Uh, yeah. Where I’m from, that’s like losing a pair of shoes. It’s whatevs, OK?” And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, “Oh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you’re having twins.” And I was like, “No!” And then she said, “But what I don’t see is a heartbeat.” And I was like, “Yes!” “The Lord is mysterious!” Don’t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I’ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won’t let their husbands watch when they’re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, “You look.” “You watch the whole thing.” And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyoncé. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That’s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted. I’m scared about giving childbirth, though. I’m– I’m very, very scared of childbirth. That’s why I’m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That’s a white hippie witch… …that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser Söze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, “Ali, did you know that you’re gonna poop on the table?” I was like, “Yeah, I look forward to it.” I’m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can’t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you– that that happens because when you’re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that’s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That’s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn’t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. “Hey, can you wash the dishes?” “No!” “Can you water the plants?” “I am not doing jack shit anymore. I’m busy makin’ a eyeball, OK? Are you makin’ a foot? I didn’t think so. You change the channel.” I can already see how there’s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor’s appointments with me. “Oh, my God. I can’t believe he comes to all your doctor’s appointments. He is so supportive.” Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I’m the star of the show. There’s nothing for the camera to see if I’m not there. But he’s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I’m a bad mommy. You know, I– I– I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I’m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis… to keep him down so that he doesn’t believe that he’s worthy of another woman’s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don’t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn’t know that. I didn’t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big– they get big, like fingers. Like, “You, you. You owe me money, you.” My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I’m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it. Now that I’m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy’s all wet again. But it’s different. It’s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, “Why is it different?” And I looked it up, and my pussy’s all wet again because my– my body’s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That’s not the same. When it’s straight up soldier glue, when it’s Neosporin. So, you know, I– I, in– previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who’s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he’s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron’d my ass. And now, if I don’t work, we die. Why else do you think I’m performing seven and a half months pregnant? All right, I’ve been Ali Wong. Have a good night, everybody. Thank you.

            "ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage: ali wong! hi. hello! welcome! thank you! thank you for coming. hello! hello. we are gonna have to get this shit over with, ’cause i have to pee in, like, ten minutes. but thank you, everybody, so much for coming. um… it’s a very exciting day for me. it’s been a very exciting year for me. i turned 33 this year. yes! thank you, five people. i appreciate that. uh, i can tell that i’m getting older, because, now, when i see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought… is “fuck you.” “fuck you. i don’t even know you, but fuck you!” ‘cause i’m straight up jealous. i’m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? they got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there’s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through. and then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. right? they don’t have insomnia yet. they don’t know what it’s like to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. they have their whole lives ahead of them. they don’t have hpv yet. they just go to sleep in peace at night. everybody has hpv, ok? everybody has it. it’s ok. come out already. everybody has it. if you don’t have it yet, you go and get it. you go and get it. it’s coming. you don’t have hpv yet, you’re a fucking loser, all right? that’s what that says about you. a lot of men don’t know that they have hpv, because it’s undetectable in men. it’s really fucked up. hpv is a ghost that lives inside men’s bodies and says, “boo!” in women’s bodies. my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv. either i have the kind that’s gonna turn into cervical cancer… …or i have the kind where my body will heal itself. very helpful, this doctor, right? so, basically, either i’m gonna die… or you’re in the presence of wolverine, bitches. we’ll find out. um, i can also tell that i’m getting older, because my kindle is turning into a self-help library. i’m not interested in books like fifty shades of grey, ok? i’m interested in the life-changing magic of tidying up. yes. yes, that’s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. that’s what your 30s is all about. how can i turn this shit around? i’m a horrible person, i’m not happy with where i am, how can i turn this shit around? help me, tony robbins, help me!\n",
            "i have a hoarding problem, which i’m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. i’m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the hpv will also disappear. i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator’s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. so, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, ’cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you’re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communists.\n",
            "the last time i was at home in san francisco, i was trying to help her get rid of shit. don’t ever do that with your mom. it was like the worst experience of my life. it was so emotional. we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments ti-82… manual. the manual. she don’t even know… where the calculator is. those of you under 25 probably don’t know what that calculator is. it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. it cost like $200. and everybody thought it was like this judy jetson’s laptop from the future. all because what? it could graph. it was like the tesla of my time. and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, “you never know when you might need this.” and i was like, “but… i do know… that i’m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.” “and i’m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. because according to deepak-oprah, that’s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.” i grew up a lot this past year. uh, this past year i also got married. yeah. to a man who now has hpv. very lucky guy. he gave me something. i gave him something. that will also last forever. no, really. i’m the lucky girl, because before him, i dated a lot of losers. lots of losers. a lot of skaters. you wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. they’re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. horrible. but my husband, i first met him at this wedding and, uh, he’s– he’s much better looking than me, he’s way out of my league, and i saw him and i was like, “oh, my god, who is that?” and the first thing i learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending harvard business school. and i was like, “oh, my god, i’m gonna trap his ass.” “going to trap his ass!” and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. but i did it on purpose, because i knew that he was a catch. so i was like, “all right, ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.” when, really, it’s a public park… …that has hosted many reggae fests… …and has even accidentally let… two homeless people inside. i thought they were hipsters, ok? that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing… for my generation. you homeless or you a hipster? is that beard for fashion or for warmth? it happened to… it happened in san francisco, when i was living there, and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had… we had so much chemistry. he was like, “hey, wassup?” i was like, “wassup?” and we– the next thing i knew, we were getting busy in the back of my volvo. and then after we were done, he was like, “hey, can you drop me off?” i was like, “where?” he was like, “at the park.” and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and i was like, “oh, no!” “i just fucked a homeless dude! again!” my husband is asian. which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, asian-american women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory. it’s… too much. i don’t know what’s wrong with these bitches. i get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very… you feel very picturesque when you’re with a white dude, you know. you feel like you’re in a wes anderson movie or something. and you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. they introduce you to cool stuff like that and it’s very, you know, it’s hot hookin’ up with a white dude. i mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. oh, my god. i just feel like i’m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement… …you know, just right there, through the money hole and just… and then also, he’s so vulnerable down there. i’m, like, “i could just crush your head at any moment, white man! i could just kill you right now! crush those brains! colonize the colonizer!” you know? but i think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. the advantage is that you get to go home… and be racist together. you get to say whatever you like! you don’t gotta explain shit. my husband, half-filipino, half-japanese. i’m half-chinese and half-vietnamese. and we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on korean people. it’s… amazing. it’s what love is built on, you know? my last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time. and i was like, “hold it. you guys aren’t mexican?” asian-american men are very underrated. i don’t know why people don’t go for them. they’re the sexiest. asian men are the sexiest. they got no body hair from the neck down. it’s like making love to a dolphin. oh, my god. it’s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. just black fish, tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? ooh-wee. you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. it’s all red and inflamed and you’re like, “i did not ask to be exfoliated today.” “this is the last time i go on j-date, more like loofah date. thanks for the rug burn, avi.” and then asian men, no body odor. none. they just smell like responsibility. that’s where the umami flavor comes from. i think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he’s half-filipino and half-japanese and i’m half-chinese and half-vietnamese. so, we’re both half-fancy asian… …and half-jungle asian. yeah! you guys know the difference. the fancy asians are the chinese, the japanese. they get to do fancy things like host olympics. jungle asians host diseases. it’s… it’s different. but he grew up on the east coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning latin and playing chess and rugby. he grew up like filipino carlton, ok? so, he didn’t know anything about vietnamese people until he met me. and on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show. he was like, “it’s authentic vietnamese. i read about it on yelp!” i was like, “it’s not authentic, ok?” you can tell, first and foremost, by the name, ’cause it don’t got a number in it. second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. if it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. when i pee, i need to see ten gallons of bleach, an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. and the wait staff here is too nice. we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused. i grew up going to private school, too. him and i are both total, like, private school asians. we both are big hippies, too. we like to backpack through southeast asia. we like to do yoga. we do ayahuasca ceremonies. we do silent meditation retreats. that’s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. we do shit like that. uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range chewbacca. we eat that lesbian bread that’s like… …a thousand percent of your daily fiber… and 20 percent spoken word poetry. when you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about… …supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever. and so, it’s funny, right, because he’s asian, too. but sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do… makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of asian people. like, we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall… and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. we’re like, “oh, that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier 1 imports. that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house. him and i had been dating for four years and i– i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose… because… i had been pressuring him to do it. so, you know, i just had this wacky women’s intuition. that’s how proposals really work, ok? a woman has to incept the idea into the man’s head. first passively and then if he doesn’t get the message, extremely aggressively. you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you’re too old and it’s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. so, you’re like, “i’m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, “shut the fuck up! fine, will you marry me?” and then afterwards, the woman is always, like, “oh, my god! he proposed!” “it came outta nowhere. and look, he got me the exact ring i wanted. how did he know? maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something… that i sent to my best friend, that i told her to send to him every day.” let me tell you something. if a man has a pinterest page… he’s probably pinterested in men. we got engaged on a saturday. i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday… because i had tried it on in 2012. i was ready. i was ripe. i was rotten. i need to be made into banana bread. that’s how rotten i was. people are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, i’m a completely different person. you– like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. with him, i’m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. we’ve been together now for five years, and for five years, i’ve packed his lunch every single day. yeah. yes. yes. yes. i did that so that he’d become dependent on me. ‘cause he graduated from harvard business school, and i don’t wanna work anymore. i don’t. i straight up don’t wanna work anymore. i don’t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. i do it as an investment in my financial future. ‘cause i don’t wanna work anymore. i’ve been reading that book by sheryl sandberg, she’s the c.o.o. of facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. and her book is called lean in. well, i don’t wanna lean in, ok? i wanna lie down. i want to lie the fuck down. i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. our job used to be no job. we had it so good. we could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, “we’re dumb women. we don’t know how to do anything. so, i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen.” “‘cause we’re too stupid to have any real responsibility.” and then, all these women had to show off and be like, “we could do it! we could do anything.” “bitch, shut up!” “don’t tell them the secret.” they ruined it for us, and now we’re expected to work. when i hear the phrase, “double-income household,” i wanna throw up. a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. and they’re like, “but, ali, we have so many more options now.” oh, you don’t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it? a lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they’ll get very judgmental about housewives that we’ll see on the street. and they’ll be like, “look at that fucking housewife. not doing anything. look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her lululemon pants.” i’m like, “that bitch is a genius.” “she’s not a housewife, she’s retired.” i do write for fresh off the boat on abc. yeah. which is… it’s a great show. i love it a lot. i love my co-workers. it’s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it’s probably one of the best you could ask for, but i still gotta work at a office every day. which means i gotta shit in a office every day. housewives, they don’t gotta shit in a office. housewives get to shit in their house. skin to seat. they don’t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. they don’t gotta… …ten times a day, every day… like you’re about to eat a sad-ass meal. they don’t gotta do that. they don’t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that’s not even effective. it basically just dehydrates your butt hole. it’s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a macgyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired ’cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then i had to start all over again. and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed ’cause you’re paranoid that your co-worker’s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. and you’re like, “oh, no! courtney’s listening. she’s waiting. she’s timing me.” and then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. and then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it’s been run over by the goonies. housewives, they don’t gotta muffle their shit, too. they don’t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. they don’t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want. they don’t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. they can listen to podcasts. planet money. they can do whatever they want. you know, it’s– it’s very distracting for me when i hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. i lose respect for them. nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. i heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, “you need to get to work on time.” i was like, “you need to eat bananas.” “i saw those green ballet flats. i know that shit was you. don’t try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit together.” my father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. um, and he was like, “hey, i wanna talk to you guys about money. you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.” i was like, “why you telling me this shit? i should not be a part of this conversation. you tell you son that. don’t your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential? why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when i said, ‘i do,’ what i really meant was, ‘oh, i’m done.'” i’m done. i don’t wanna work anymore and i’m not dieting anymore. since i got married last year, i’ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. that’s right. and just fulfilling my destiny. which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. like mrs. pacman, just… let’s redecorate. i gave up a lot of myself when i got married. i’m a– i’m a disgusting pervert. i’m a pervert. i’m a gross filthy animal. and i think it’s because i started watching porn at a very young age. and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that… y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. the images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it’s ok, because the internet will always catch up to you. i broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. i was like, “uh, you’re a idiot, dude. do you realize that if i went on craigslist… and posted ‘tiny asian female seeking anal…’ the internet would crash.” “and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.” they would explode. a lot of women get really, you know… freaked out about anal. and they’re like, “oh, i don’t wanna do that. i’m scared of– of the pain.” you ain’t scared of the pain. women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. you’re not scared of the pain. what you’re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. you’re scared that he’s gonna see that and that’s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. sephora can’t help you now. but don’t worry, ’cause when he puts it in the butt, all he’s thinking about is, “i just put it in her butt.” “i gotta go call my mom, my dad, dave, my grandma.” you’re– if you’re married, you’re gonna have to do anal eventually, ok? you have to, because you gotta change it up. you gotta change it up, so that you don’t cheat on each other. you gotta keep it interesting. if you put it in different holes, maybe you’ll feel like you’re fucking different people. i was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, i’m a little bit… …stretched out down there, ok? so, when i finally did anal, i just felt like i got a second chance at life, you know? i was, like, “oh, my god! it’s like i’m going back in time!” ♪ a whole new world ♪ it was magical. a big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. yeah, like a conqueror. i just wanted to… now, if you haven’t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. do it tonight. you only live once. yolo. just sneak your– just give your man a little– a little push-push in the tush-tush. just give him a little atari, you know, and you’ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. you’ll get a lot of “no! no! no! no, please! no, really, i don’t– no! i don’t! i don’t! no!” they get all squirmy wormy because… they’re scared. they’re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they’re gay. and i like that fear. that shit turns me on, you know? especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. oh, my god! and you just see the look in the man’s eye like he’s discovered nirvana. and it’s like you’re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. and then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the lord of the rim, you know? my husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. when– when i’ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. “hey. hey, are you ok? are you all right? you know i respect you, right?” i’m, like, “yes, i know you respect me and that’s why you need to abuse me. ok?” ‘cause it’s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. women who are c.e.o.s, they just wanna be roughed around. they just want their– glasses always means the woman wants some– it’s because we’re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? like, “i don’t wanna die! don’t kill me! i don’t wanna die!” but i also don’t want to be sure that i’m gonna live. you know? i just wanna be out of control for once. just– just choke me enough so that i can’t talk. ‘cause if i can talk, i’m gonna tell you what to do. and i’m tired of being the boss. i’m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. yes. because i’m the real boss. and i told you so, motherfucker, so do it. sheryl sandberg, that woman who wrote lean in, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word “bossy” in elementary schools, because according to her, it’s sexist to use the word “bossy,” because boys are never called bossy. so, now, instead of saying, “you’re bossy,” you’re supposed to say, “you have executive leadership skills.” which is a very roundabout way of saying: “you’re a little cunt.” i’m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? i want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. i wanna get to the point as a couple where i can comfortably afford sliced mango. know what i’m talking about? i’m talking about that whole foods mango. that $10-a-box whole foods mango that was sliced by white people. that’s the kind of income bracket i’m striving for. that’s when you know you’ve made it, when you’re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named noah. i want noah mango… …rebecca kiwi, danielle pineapple. you know what else i want? i wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. like a princess. i have some useful advice for all my asian-american brothers and sisters. yeah! never go paintballing with a vietnam veteran. so, i don’t know if you guys can tell, but i am seven and a half months pregnant. yeah. it’s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics… don’t get pregnant. just try to think of one. i dare you. there’s– none of them. once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. that’s not the case with male comics. once they have a baby, they’ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they’ll be like, “guys, i just had this fucking baby. that baby’s a little piece of shit. it’s so annoying and boring.” and all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, “that’s hilarious. i identify.” and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper ’cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby’s head shredding it up. she’s busy. so, i don’t know what’s gonna happen to me. you know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. and they were like, “ali, why are you gonna have a kid? you just gonna become– you’re gonna disappear, and you’re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.” i was like, “yeah, that’s the dream.” that’s the point. this is the ultimate trap. i won, you know? another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, “why are you gonna have a kid? why don’t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.” i was like, “yeah, that’s cool… until my husband dies.” which he’s definitely gonna before me. because i’m a asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until i’m a billion. i’m guaranteed, like a turtle from the galapagos, ok? we all know the phrase “black don’t crack.” well, asian don’t die. we don’t die. especially the women, we live forever. and you know why we’re such bad drivers? because we’re trying to die. we’re like, “yeah! let me see how invincible i really am!” “imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.” “i’m gonna make a right turn– i changed my mind, it’s a u-turn!” “i changed my mind again. it’s a o-turn!” every time i get into a car accident… …i’m like, “oh, my god, not again!” i need to hide my face so that everybody doesn’t see that it’s what everybody thought it was gonna be. so embarrassing. my toyota corolla is a mess. there’s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. and then, on the hood, there’s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. i don’t know what’s wrong with me, but i’m still here, you know? i need to have children to keep me company when i get older. it’s lonely. my mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. ‘cause she knows that she’s got a century more to go. and she is so lonely. all of her white friends, dead. her mexican friends, dead. black friends, dead. i’m just kidding. she doesn’t have any black friends. life is not rush hour, the movie, ok? i need children to be there for me when i’m older, when i get as old as her. and when i say be there for me, i mean pay for me when my husband isn’t around to support me anymore. i’m not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living. that’s not my destiny, ok? old chinese ladies, they don’t give a fuck. they got no shame. they’re like, “i’m just gonna recycle… go bald… go to the park, do this shit.” they do that ’cause it’s a free activity. for them. they do it in their– their big-ass v. stiviano visor, their darth vader-tomb raider- boba fett helmet. they wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. their in a contest to see who’s gonna burn out first. old asian ladies and the sun are like the tupac and biggie of longevity. i also decided to have a kid because uh, i’m only 33, which, i know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. and it– and it scared me. like, i’m only 33 and… …my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. it’s very demoralizing, ok? do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? all the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. oh, my god, it was so juicy. you could just blow a bubble wand with it, just… “i slime you, i slime you. ghostbusters!” i don’t know what kind of mother i’m gonna be. i’m– i’m 33, and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. and a lot of that… is most likely my fault. because, when i was in my 20s, i ate plan b like skittles. so, my uterus probably looked like a smoker’s lung. and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. so, then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and push pop them up myself every single night. and then, at my writing job, at fresh off the boat, i would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and i had to act like everything was ok, when everything was clearly not ok. and then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. so, then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. they just vacuum, scratch, sniff. they make a sandwich. “uh, mmm.” they watch property brothers, scratch, “what’s crackin’? mmm.” every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, “when can i smell my fingers? when can i smell my fingers? when can i discretely find a way to…” “…smell my fingers?” nature made you urgently curious to protect you, ’cause you gotta check that it’s all good in the hood. if it’s too funky, you need to see a doctor. your fingers are your first webmd. when my husband and i were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, “oh, my god, that’s so hot. you guys doin’ a lot of fuckin’?” no, dude. that’s– that’s shit you do in your 20s, ok? when in– when you’re in your 30s, and you’ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin’. it tells you when it’s easter time. and i would only fuck him when it was easter time. it was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, i would be like, “we’re not fuckin’. i need you to save it. i want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. so that, when they come out, it’s like, ‘release the kraken!'” and they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? and, um… yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn’t even have sex, ’cause i was so tired when i would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and i’d be like, “ok, it’s go time,” and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. i know what that means, ok? when somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s not because they’re in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes. when somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s because they’re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids. which is fine by me, because then he doesn’t have to see the expression on my face that says, “please, hurry the fuck up.” and then, when he was about to finish, i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. it’s when they get that… that stupid-ass look on their face… …where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just… and then, because we’re hippies, i’d be like, “hey, hey! please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, ok?” and then, i would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and i would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him… and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta. and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards… to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. that’s right. ‘cause i don’t wanna work anymore. i’m very grateful to be pregnant and to be… this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, i had a miscarriage, which is very common. and a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. they’re like, “oh, my god. that’s so dark and terrible. i can’t believe that.” i’m 33. girl, when you’re 33, you’ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. it’s super common, and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn’t feel so bad when they go through it. when i told my mom– she’s from a third world country, and when i told her i had one, she was like, “uh, yeah. where i’m from, that’s like losing a pair of shoes. it’s whatevs, ok?” and everything happens for a reason. i found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. and the doctor says to me, “oh, my god, i see two sacks, which means you’re having twins.” and i was like, “no!” and then she said, “but what i don’t see is a heartbeat.” and i was like, “yes!” “the lord is mysterious!” don’t feel bad, ok? they were the size of poppy seeds. i’ve picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost. and most women won’t let their husbands watch when they’re going through a miscarriage. i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet, and i was like, “you look.” “you watch the whole thing.” and he felt so bad for me. and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for 30 days. he took me to see beyoncé. he bought me a bike off of craigslist. that’s my miscarriage bike, and i love it very much. for 30 days, i finally had the marriage i always wanted. i’m scared about giving childbirth, though. i’m– i’m very, very scared of childbirth. that’s why i’m going to hire a doula. you know what that is? you know what a doula is? that’s a white hippie witch… …that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser söze all the pain away. a lot of women tried to freak me out. they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, “ali, did you know that you’re gonna poop on the table?” i was like, “yeah, i look forward to it.” i’m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. i can’t wait to cleanse. it makes sense, like, that you– that that happens because when you’re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. and just when you think that’s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. that’s the real miracle of life, right there. i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn’t even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband. so much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. “hey, can you wash the dishes?” “no!” “can you water the plants?” “i am not doing jack shit anymore. i’m busy makin’ a eyeball, ok? are you makin’ a foot? i didn’t think so. you change the channel.” i can already see how there’s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor’s appointments with me. “oh, my god. i can’t believe he comes to all your doctor’s appointments. he is so supportive.” guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. me! i’m the star of the show. there’s nothing for the camera to see if i’m not there. but he’s the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn. meanwhile, if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant, i’m a bad mommy. you know, i– i– i, like, i berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. partially because i really am mad at him. but mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, i’m fucked. so, i have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis… to keep him down so that he doesn’t believe that he’s worthy of another woman’s affection and leaves me. i gotta keep him around by keeping him down. people don’t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? your nipples get huge and dark. i didn’t know that. i didn’t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. so that the baby can find it easier. and then, you know, they get big– they get big, like fingers. like, “you, you. you owe me money, you.” my nipples look like whoppers now, and naked, i look like a minion. but i’m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. no. hopefully, if you see me in a year, i will have the kind of body where, if i do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. for doing it. now that i’m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy’s all wet again. but it’s different. it’s not like when i was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? and i was like, “why is it different?” and i looked it up, and my pussy’s all wet again because my– my body’s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. that’s not the same. when it’s straight up soldier glue, when it’s neosporin. so, you know, i– i, in– previously, before i met my husband, i had dated a bunch of losers. and then, i meet this dream guy, who’s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from harvard business school. worked hard to trap his ass. got him to propose to me. oh, my god, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. and, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, i discovered that my beautiful, harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. and me, with my hard-earned tv money, paid it all off. so, as it turns out, he’s the one who trapped me. how did he do it? how did he bamboozle me? oh! maybe because he went to harvard business school, the epicenter of white-collar crime. he enron’d my ass. and now, if i don’t work, we die. why else do you think i’m performing seven and a half months pregnant?

            "ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage: ali wong! hi. hello! welcome! thank you! thank you for coming. hello! hello. we are gonna have to get this shit over with, ’cause i have to pee in, like, ten minutes. but thank you, everybody, so much for coming. um… it’s a very exciting day for me. it’s been a very exciting year for me. i turned 33 this year. yes! thank you, five people. i appreciate that. uh, i can tell that i’m getting older, because, now, when i see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought… is “fuck you.” “fuck you. i don’t even know you, but fuck you!” ‘cause i’m straight up jealous. i’m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? they got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there’s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through. and then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. right? they don’t have insomnia yet. they don’t know what it’s like to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. they have their whole lives ahead of them. they don’t have hpv yet. they just go to sleep in peace at night. everybody has hpv, ok? everybody has it. it’s ok. come out already. everybody has it. if you don’t have it yet, you go and get it. you go and get it. it’s coming. you don’t have hpv yet, you’re a fucking loser, all right? that’s what that says about you. a lot of men don’t know that they have hpv, because it’s undetectable in men. it’s really fucked up. hpv is a ghost that lives inside men’s bodies and says, “boo!” in women’s bodies. my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv. either i have the kind that’s gonna turn into cervical cancer… …or i have the kind where my body will heal itself. very helpful, this doctor, right? so, basically, either i’m gonna die… or you’re in the presence of wolverine, bitches. we’ll find out. um, i can also tell that i’m getting older, because my kindle is turning into a self-help library. i’m not interested in books like fifty shades of grey, ok? i’m interested in the life-changing magic of tidying up. yes. yes, that’s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. that’s what your 30s is all about. how can i turn this shit around? i’m a horrible person, i’m not happy with where i am, how can i turn this shit around? help me, tony robbins, help me!\n",
            "i have a hoarding problem, which i’m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. i’m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the hpv will also disappear. i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator’s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. so, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, ’cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you’re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communists.\n",
            "the last time i was at home in san francisco, i was trying to help her get rid of shit. don’t ever do that with your mom. it was like the worst experience of my life. it was so emotional. we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments ti-82… manual. the manual. she don’t even know… where the calculator is. those of you under 25 probably don’t know what that calculator is. it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. it cost like $200. and everybody thought it was like this judy jetson’s laptop from the future. all because what? it could graph. it was like the tesla of my time. and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, “you never know when you might need this.” and i was like, “but… i do know… that i’m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.” “and i’m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. because according to deepak-oprah, that’s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.” i grew up a lot this past year. uh, this past year i also got married. yeah. to a man who now has hpv. very lucky guy. he gave me something. i gave him something. that will also last forever. no, really. i’m the lucky girl, because before him, i dated a lot of losers. lots of losers. a lot of skaters. you wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. they’re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. horrible. but my husband, i first met him at this wedding and, uh, he’s– he’s much better looking than me, he’s way out of my league, and i saw him and i was like, “oh, my god, who is that?” and the first thing i learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending harvard business school. and i was like, “oh, my god, i’m gonna trap his ass.” “going to trap his ass!” and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. but i did it on purpose, because i knew that he was a catch. so i was like, “all right, ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.” when, really, it’s a public park… …that has hosted many reggae fests… …and has even accidentally let… two homeless people inside. i thought they were hipsters, ok? that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing… for my generation. you homeless or you a hipster? is that beard for fashion or for warmth? it happened to… it happened in san francisco, when i was living there, and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had… we had so much chemistry. he was like, “hey, wassup?” i was like, “wassup?” and we– the next thing i knew, we were getting busy in the back of my volvo. and then after we were done, he was like, “hey, can you drop me off?” i was like, “where?” he was like, “at the park.” and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and i was like, “oh, no!” “i just fucked a homeless dude! again!” my husband is asian. which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, asian-american women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory. it’s… too much. i don’t know what’s wrong with these bitches. i get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very… you feel very picturesque when you’re with a white dude, you know. you feel like you’re in a wes anderson movie or something. and you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. they introduce you to cool stuff like that and it’s very, you know, it’s hot hookin’ up with a white dude. i mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. oh, my god. i just feel like i’m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement… …you know, just right there, through the money hole and just… and then also, he’s so vulnerable down there. i’m, like, “i could just crush your head at any moment, white man! i could just kill you right now! crush those brains! colonize the colonizer!” you know? but i think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. the advantage is that you get to go home… and be racist together. you get to say whatever you like! you don’t gotta explain shit. my husband, half-filipino, half-japanese. i’m half-chinese and half-vietnamese. and we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on korean people. it’s… amazing. it’s what love is built on, you know? my last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time. and i was like, “hold it. you guys aren’t mexican?” asian-american men are very underrated. i don’t know why people don’t go for them. they’re the sexiest. asian men are the sexiest. they got no body hair from the neck down. it’s like making love to a dolphin. oh, my god. it’s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. just black fish, tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? ooh-wee. you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. it’s all red and inflamed and you’re like, “i did not ask to be exfoliated today.” “this is the last time i go on j-date, more like loofah date. thanks for the rug burn, avi.” and then asian men, no body odor. none. they just smell like responsibility. that’s where the umami flavor comes from. i think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he’s half-filipino and half-japanese and i’m half-chinese and half-vietnamese. so, we’re both half-fancy asian… …and half-jungle asian. yeah! you guys know the difference. the fancy asians are the chinese, the japanese. they get to do fancy things like host olympics. jungle asians host diseases. it’s… it’s different. but he grew up on the east coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning latin and playing chess and rugby. he grew up like filipino carlton, ok? so, he didn’t know anything about vietnamese people until he met me. and on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show. he was like, “it’s authentic vietnamese. i read about it on yelp!” i was like, “it’s not authentic, ok?” you can tell, first and foremost, by the name, ’cause it don’t got a number in it. second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. if it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. when i pee, i need to see ten gallons of bleach, an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. and the wait staff here is too nice. we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused. i grew up going to private school, too. him and i are both total, like, private school asians. we both are big hippies, too. we like to backpack through southeast asia. we like to do yoga. we do ayahuasca ceremonies. we do silent meditation retreats. that’s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. we do shit like that. uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range chewbacca. we eat that lesbian bread that’s like… …a thousand percent of your daily fiber… and 20 percent spoken word poetry. when you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about… …supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever. and so, it’s funny, right, because he’s asian, too. but sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do… makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of asian people. like, we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall… and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. we’re like, “oh, that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier 1 imports. that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house. him and i had been dating for four years and i– i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose… because… i had been pressuring him to do it. so, you know, i just had this wacky women’s intuition. that’s how proposals really work, ok? a woman has to incept the idea into the man’s head. first passively and then if he doesn’t get the message, extremely aggressively. you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you’re too old and it’s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. so, you’re like, “i’m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, “shut the fuck up! fine, will you marry me?” and then afterwards, the woman is always, like, “oh, my god! he proposed!” “it came outta nowhere. and look, he got me the exact ring i wanted. how did he know? maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something… that i sent to my best friend, that i told her to send to him every day.” let me tell you something. if a man has a pinterest page… he’s probably pinterested in men. we got engaged on a saturday. i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday… because i had tried it on in 2012. i was ready. i was ripe. i was rotten. i need to be made into banana bread. that’s how rotten i was. people are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, i’m a completely different person. you– like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. with him, i’m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. we’ve been together now for five years, and for five years, i’ve packed his lunch every single day. yeah. yes. yes. yes. i did that so that he’d become dependent on me. ‘cause he graduated from harvard business school, and i don’t wanna work anymore. i don’t. i straight up don’t wanna work anymore. i don’t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. i do it as an investment in my financial future. ‘cause i don’t wanna work anymore. i’ve been reading that book by sheryl sandberg, she’s the c.o.o. of facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. and her book is called lean in. well, i don’t wanna lean in, ok? i wanna lie down. i want to lie the fuck down. i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. our job used to be no job. we had it so good. we could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, “we’re dumb women. we don’t know how to do anything. so, i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen.” “‘cause we’re too stupid to have any real responsibility.” and then, all these women had to show off and be like, “we could do it! we could do anything.” “bitch, shut up!” “don’t tell them the secret.” they ruined it for us, and now we’re expected to work. when i hear the phrase, “double-income household,” i wanna throw up. a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. and they’re like, “but, ali, we have so many more options now.” oh, you don’t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it? a lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they’ll get very judgmental about housewives that we’ll see on the street. and they’ll be like, “look at that fucking housewife. not doing anything. look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her lululemon pants.” i’m like, “that bitch is a genius.” “she’s not a housewife, she’s retired.” i do write for fresh off the boat on abc. yeah. which is… it’s a great show. i love it a lot. i love my co-workers. it’s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it’s probably one of the best you could ask for, but i still gotta work at a office every day. which means i gotta shit in a office every day. housewives, they don’t gotta shit in a office. housewives get to shit in their house. skin to seat. they don’t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. they don’t gotta… …ten times a day, every day… like you’re about to eat a sad-ass meal. they don’t gotta do that. they don’t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that’s not even effective. it basically just dehydrates your butt hole. it’s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a macgyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired ’cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then i had to start all over again. and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed ’cause you’re paranoid that your co-worker’s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. and you’re like, “oh, no! courtney’s listening. she’s waiting. she’s timing me.” and then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. and then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it’s been run over by the goonies. housewives, they don’t gotta muffle their shit, too. they don’t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. they don’t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want. they don’t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. they can listen to podcasts. planet money. they can do whatever they want. you know, it’s– it’s very distracting for me when i hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. i lose respect for them. nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. i heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, “you need to get to work on time.” i was like, “you need to eat bananas.” “i saw those green ballet flats. i know that shit was you. don’t try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit together.” my father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. um, and he was like, “hey, i wanna talk to you guys about money. you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.” i was like, “why you telling me this shit? i should not be a part of this conversation. you tell you son that. don’t your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential? why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when i said, ‘i do,’ what i really meant was, ‘oh, i’m done.'” i’m done. i don’t wanna work anymore and i’m not dieting anymore. since i got married last year, i’ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. that’s right. and just fulfilling my destiny. which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. like mrs. pacman, just… let’s redecorate. i gave up a lot of myself when i got married. i’m a– i’m a disgusting pervert. i’m a pervert. i’m a gross filthy animal. and i think it’s because i started watching porn at a very young age. and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that… y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. the images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it’s ok, because the internet will always catch up to you. i broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. i was like, “uh, you’re a idiot, dude. do you realize that if i went on craigslist… and posted ‘tiny asian female seeking anal…’ the internet would crash.” “and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.” they would explode. a lot of women get really, you know… freaked out about anal. and they’re like, “oh, i don’t wanna do that. i’m scared of– of the pain.” you ain’t scared of the pain. women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. you’re not scared of the pain. what you’re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. you’re scared that he’s gonna see that and that’s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. sephora can’t help you now. but don’t worry, ’cause when he puts it in the butt, all he’s thinking about is, “i just put it in her butt.” “i gotta go call my mom, my dad, dave, my grandma.” you’re– if you’re married, you’re gonna have to do anal eventually, ok? you have to, because you gotta change it up. you gotta change it up, so that you don’t cheat on each other. you gotta keep it interesting. if you put it in different holes, maybe you’ll feel like you’re fucking different people. i was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, i’m a little bit… …stretched out down there, ok? so, when i finally did anal, i just felt like i got a second chance at life, you know? i was, like, “oh, my god! it’s like i’m going back in time!” ♪ a whole new world ♪ it was magical. a big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. yeah, like a conqueror. i just wanted to… now, if you haven’t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. do it tonight. you only live once. yolo. just sneak your– just give your man a little– a little push-push in the tush-tush. just give him a little atari, you know, and you’ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. you’ll get a lot of “no! no! no! no, please! no, really, i don’t– no! i don’t! i don’t! no!” they get all squirmy wormy because… they’re scared. they’re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they’re gay. and i like that fear. that shit turns me on, you know? especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. oh, my god! and you just see the look in the man’s eye like he’s discovered nirvana. and it’s like you’re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. and then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the lord of the rim, you know? my husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. when– when i’ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. “hey. hey, are you ok? are you all right? you know i respect you, right?” i’m, like, “yes, i know you respect me and that’s why you need to abuse me. ok?” ‘cause it’s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. women who are c.e.o.s, they just wanna be roughed around. they just want their– glasses always means the woman wants some– it’s because we’re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? like, “i don’t wanna die! don’t kill me! i don’t wanna die!” but i also don’t want to be sure that i’m gonna live. you know? i just wanna be out of control for once. just– just choke me enough so that i can’t talk. ‘cause if i can talk, i’m gonna tell you what to do. and i’m tired of being the boss. i’m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. yes. because i’m the real boss. and i told you so, motherfucker, so do it. sheryl sandberg, that woman who wrote lean in, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word “bossy” in elementary schools, because according to her, it’s sexist to use the word “bossy,” because boys are never called bossy. so, now, instead of saying, “you’re bossy,” you’re supposed to say, “you have executive leadership skills.” which is a very roundabout way of saying: “you’re a little cunt.” i’m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? i want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. i wanna get to the point as a couple where i can comfortably afford sliced mango. know what i’m talking about? i’m talking about that whole foods mango. that $10-a-box whole foods mango that was sliced by white people. that’s the kind of income bracket i’m striving for. that’s when you know you’ve made it, when you’re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named noah. i want noah mango… …rebecca kiwi, danielle pineapple. you know what else i want? i wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. like a princess. i have some useful advice for all my asian-american brothers and sisters. yeah! never go paintballing with a vietnam veteran. so, i don’t know if you guys can tell, but i am seven and a half months pregnant. yeah. it’s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics… don’t get pregnant. just try to think of one. i dare you. there’s– none of them. once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. that’s not the case with male comics. once they have a baby, they’ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they’ll be like, “guys, i just had this fucking baby. that baby’s a little piece of shit. it’s so annoying and boring.” and all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, “that’s hilarious. i identify.” and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper ’cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby’s head shredding it up. she’s busy. so, i don’t know what’s gonna happen to me. you know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. and they were like, “ali, why are you gonna have a kid? you just gonna become– you’re gonna disappear, and you’re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.” i was like, “yeah, that’s the dream.” that’s the point. this is the ultimate trap. i won, you know? another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, “why are you gonna have a kid? why don’t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.” i was like, “yeah, that’s cool… until my husband dies.” which he’s definitely gonna before me. because i’m a asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until i’m a billion. i’m guaranteed, like a turtle from the galapagos, ok? we all know the phrase “black don’t crack.” well, asian don’t die. we don’t die. especially the women, we live forever. and you know why we’re such bad drivers? because we’re trying to die. we’re like, “yeah! let me see how invincible i really am!” “imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.” “i’m gonna make a right turn– i changed my mind, it’s a u-turn!” “i changed my mind again. it’s a o-turn!” every time i get into a car accident… …i’m like, “oh, my god, not again!” i need to hide my face so that everybody doesn’t see that it’s what everybody thought it was gonna be. so embarrassing. my toyota corolla is a mess. there’s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. and then, on the hood, there’s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. i don’t know what’s wrong with me, but i’m still here, you know? i need to have children to keep me company when i get older. it’s lonely. my mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. ‘cause she knows that she’s got a century more to go. and she is so lonely. all of her white friends, dead. her mexican friends, dead. black friends, dead. i’m just kidding. she doesn’t have any black friends. life is not rush hour, the movie, ok? i need children to be there for me when i’m older, when i get as old as her. and when i say be there for me, i mean pay for me when my husband isn’t around to support me anymore. i’m not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living. that’s not my destiny, ok? old chinese ladies, they don’t give a fuck. they got no shame. they’re like, “i’m just gonna recycle… go bald… go to the park, do this shit.” they do that ’cause it’s a free activity. for them. they do it in their– their big-ass v. stiviano visor, their darth vader-tomb raider- boba fett helmet. they wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. their in a contest to see who’s gonna burn out first. old asian ladies and the sun are like the tupac and biggie of longevity. i also decided to have a kid because uh, i’m only 33, which, i know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. and it– and it scared me. like, i’m only 33 and… …my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. it’s very demoralizing, ok? do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? all the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. oh, my god, it was so juicy. you could just blow a bubble wand with it, just… “i slime you, i slime you. ghostbusters!” i don’t know what kind of mother i’m gonna be. i’m– i’m 33, and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. and a lot of that… is most likely my fault. because, when i was in my 20s, i ate plan b like skittles. so, my uterus probably looked like a smoker’s lung. and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. so, then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and push pop them up myself every single night. and then, at my writing job, at fresh off the boat, i would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and i had to act like everything was ok, when everything was clearly not ok. and then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. so, then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. they just vacuum, scratch, sniff. they make a sandwich. “uh, mmm.” they watch property brothers, scratch, “what’s crackin’? mmm.” every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, “when can i smell my fingers? when can i smell my fingers? when can i discretely find a way to…” “…smell my fingers?” nature made you urgently curious to protect you, ’cause you gotta check that it’s all good in the hood. if it’s too funky, you need to see a doctor. your fingers are your first webmd. when my husband and i were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, “oh, my god, that’s so hot. you guys doin’ a lot of fuckin’?” no, dude. that’s– that’s shit you do in your 20s, ok? when in– when you’re in your 30s, and you’ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin’. it tells you when it’s easter time. and i would only fuck him when it was easter time. it was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, i would be like, “we’re not fuckin’. i need you to save it. i want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. so that, when they come out, it’s like, ‘release the kraken!'” and they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? and, um… yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn’t even have sex, ’cause i was so tired when i would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and i’d be like, “ok, it’s go time,” and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. i know what that means, ok? when somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s not because they’re in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes. when somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s because they’re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids. which is fine by me, because then he doesn’t have to see the expression on my face that says, “please, hurry the fuck up.” and then, when he was about to finish, i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. it’s when they get that… that stupid-ass look on their face… …where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just… and then, because we’re hippies, i’d be like, “hey, hey! please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, ok?” and then, i would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and i would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him… and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta. and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards… to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. that’s right. ‘cause i don’t wanna work anymore. i’m very grateful to be pregnant and to be… this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, i had a miscarriage, which is very common. and a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. they’re like, “oh, my god. that’s so dark and terrible. i can’t believe that.” i’m 33. girl, when you’re 33, you’ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. it’s super common, and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn’t feel so bad when they go through it. when i told my mom– she’s from a third world country, and when i told her i had one, she was like, “uh, yeah. where i’m from, that’s like losing a pair of shoes. it’s whatevs, ok?” and everything happens for a reason. i found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. and the doctor says to me, “oh, my god, i see two sacks, which means you’re having twins.” and i was like, “no!” and then she said, “but what i don’t see is a heartbeat.” and i was like, “yes!” “the lord is mysterious!” don’t feel bad, ok? they were the size of poppy seeds. i’ve picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost. and most women won’t let their husbands watch when they’re going through a miscarriage. i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet, and i was like, “you look.” “you watch the whole thing.” and he felt so bad for me. and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for 30 days. he took me to see beyoncé. he bought me a bike off of craigslist. that’s my miscarriage bike, and i love it very much. for 30 days, i finally had the marriage i always wanted. i’m scared about giving childbirth, though. i’m– i’m very, very scared of childbirth. that’s why i’m going to hire a doula. you know what that is? you know what a doula is? that’s a white hippie witch… …that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser söze all the pain away. a lot of women tried to freak me out. they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, “ali, did you know that you’re gonna poop on the table?” i was like, “yeah, i look forward to it.” i’m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. i can’t wait to cleanse. it makes sense, like, that you– that that happens because when you’re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. and just when you think that’s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. that’s the real miracle of life, right there. i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn’t even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband. so much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. “hey, can you wash the dishes?” “no!” “can you water the plants?” “i am not doing jack shit anymore. i’m busy makin’ a eyeball, ok? are you makin’ a foot? i didn’t think so. you change the channel.” i can already see how there’s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor’s appointments with me. “oh, my god. i can’t believe he comes to all your doctor’s appointments. he is so supportive.” guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. me! i’m the star of the show. there’s nothing for the camera to see if i’m not there. but he’s the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn. meanwhile, if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant, i’m a bad mommy. you know, i– i– i, like, i berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. partially because i really am mad at him. but mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, i’m fucked. so, i have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis… to keep him down so that he doesn’t believe that he’s worthy of another woman’s affection and leaves me. i gotta keep him around by keeping him down. people don’t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? your nipples get huge and dark. i didn’t know that. i didn’t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. so that the baby can find it easier. and then, you know, they get big– they get big, like fingers. like, “you, you. you owe me money, you.” my nipples look like whoppers now, and naked, i look like a minion. but i’m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. no. hopefully, if you see me in a year, i will have the kind of body where, if i do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. for doing it. now that i’m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy’s all wet again. but it’s different. it’s not like when i was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? and i was like, “why is it different?” and i looked it up, and my pussy’s all wet again because my– my body’s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. that’s not the same. when it’s straight up soldier glue, when it’s neosporin. so, you know, i– i, in– previously, before i met my husband, i had dated a bunch of losers. and then, i meet this dream guy, who’s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from harvard business school. worked hard to trap his ass. got him to propose to me. oh, my god, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. and, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, i discovered that my beautiful, harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. and me, with my hard-earned tv money, paid it all off. so, as it turns out, he’s the one who trapped me. how did he do it? how did he bamboozle me? oh! maybe because he went to harvard business school, the epicenter of white-collar crime. he enron’d my ass. and now, if i don’t work, we die. why else do you think i’m performing seven and a half months pregnant? all right, i’ve been ali wong. have a good night, everybody. thank you. your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * \n",

            "i have a hoarding problem which i’m hoping is the center of all of my other problems i’m hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictator’s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade ’cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you’re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communists\n",
            "the last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit don’t ever do that with your mom it was like the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments ti82… manual the manual she don’t even know… where the calculator is those of you under 25 probably don’t know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost like 200 and everybody thought it was like this judy jetson’s laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was like the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like “you never know when you might need this” and i was like “but… i do know… that i’m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die” “and i’m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah that’s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success” i grew up a lot this past year uh this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really i’m the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen they’re sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and uh he’s– he’s much better looking than me he’s way out of my league and i saw him and i was like “oh my god who is that” and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was like “oh my god i’m gonna trap his ass” “going to trap his ass” and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was like “all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden” when really it’s a public park… …that has hosted many reggae fests… …and has even accidentally let… two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing… for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to… it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had like we had… we had so much chemistry he was like “hey wassup” i was like “wassup” and we– the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was like “hey can you drop me off” i was like “where” he was like “at the park” and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was like “oh no” “i just fucked a homeless dude again” my husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who like you know wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they like to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory it’s… too much i don’t know what’s wrong with these bitches i get it you know because being with a white dude you feel very… you feel very picturesque when you’re with a white dude you know you feel like you’re in a wes anderson movie or something and you know white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff like that and it’s very you know it’s hot hookin’ up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel like i’m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement… …you know just right there through the money hole and just… and then also he’s so vulnerable down there i’m like “i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer” you know but i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home… and be racist together you get to say whatever you like you don’t gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese i’m halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on korean people it’s… amazing it’s what love is built on you know my last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was like “hold it you guys aren’t mexican” asianamerican men are very underrated i don’t know why people don’t go for them they’re the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down it’s like making love to a dolphin oh my god it’s so smooth just like a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night you know oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards it’s all red and inflamed and you’re like “i did not ask to be exfoliated today” “this is the last time i go on jdate more like loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi” and then asian men no body odor none they just smell like responsibility that’s where the umami flavor comes from i think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding uh between each other because he’s halffilipino and halfjapanese and i’m halfchinese and halfvietnamese so we’re both halffancy asian… …and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things like host olympics jungle asians host diseases it’s… it’s different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse uh you know learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up like filipino carlton ok so he didn’t know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was like “it’s authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp” i was like “it’s not authentic ok” you can tell first and foremost by the name ’cause it don’t got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused i grew up going to private school too him and i are both total like private school asians we both are big hippies too we like to backpack through southeast asia we like to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats that’s right we pay 800 to shut up for a weekend we do shit like that uh we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes like freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread that’s like… …a thousand percent of your daily fiber… and 20 percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about… …supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so it’s funny right because he’s asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do… makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of asian people like we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall… and neither of us know what the fuck they mean we’re like “oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier 1 imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house him and i had been dating for four years and i– i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose… because… i had been pressuring him to do it so you know i just had this wacky women’s intuition that’s how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the man’s head first passively and then if he doesn’t get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because you know that you’re too old and it’s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so you’re like “i’m just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like “shut the fuck up fine will you marry me” and then afterwards the woman is always like “oh my god he proposed” “it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something… that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day” let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page… he’s probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday… because i had tried it on in 2012 i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread that’s how rotten i was people are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband i’m a completely different person you– like you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him i’m very soft and like very nurturing and very domestic we’ve been together now for five years and for five years i’ve packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that he’d become dependent on me ‘cause he graduated from harvard business school and i don’t wanna work anymore i don’t i straight up don’t wanna work anymore i don’t feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future ‘cause i don’t wanna work anymore i’ve been reading that book by sheryl sandberg she’s the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i don’t wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like “we’re dumb women we don’t know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen” “‘cause we’re too stupid to have any real responsibility” and then all these women had to show off and be like “we could do it we could do anything” “bitch shut up” “don’t tell them the secret” they ruined it for us and now we’re expected to work when i hear the phrase “doubleincome household” i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and they’re like “but ali we have so many more options now” oh you don’t think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it a lot of my friends when we walk around together they’ll get very judgmental about housewives that we’ll see on the street and they’ll be like “look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants” i’m like “that bitch is a genius” “she’s not a housewife she’s retired” i do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is… it’s a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers it’s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs it’s probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they don’t gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they don’t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they don’t gotta… …ten times a day every day… like you’re about to eat a sadass meal they don’t gotta do that they don’t gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that’s not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole it’s basically like wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired ’cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed ’cause you’re paranoid that your coworker’s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and you’re like “oh no courtney’s listening she’s waiting she’s timing me” and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks like it’s been run over by the goonies housewives they don’t gotta muffle their shit too they don’t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they don’t gotta try to you know squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they don’t gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they want you know it’s– it’s very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say “you need to get to work on time” i was like “you need to eat bananas” “i saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you don’t try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit together” my fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently um and he was like “hey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had” i was like “why you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that don’t your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said ‘i do’ what i really meant was ‘oh i’m done” i’m done i don’t wanna work anymore and i’m not dieting anymore since i got married last year i’ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since that’s right and just fulfilling my destiny which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes like mrs pacman just… let’s redecorate i gave up a lot of myself when i got married i’m a– i’m a disgusting pervert i’m a pervert i’m a gross filthy animal and i think it’s because i started watching porn at a very young age and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that… yyou get sicker and sicker and sicker the images you crave get sicker and sicker and sicker but it’s ok because the internet will always catch up to you i broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back i was like “uh you’re a idiot dude do you realize that if i went on craigslist… and posted ‘tiny asian female seeking anal…’ the internet would crash” “and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode” they would explode a lot of women get really you know… freaked out about anal and they’re like “oh i don’t wanna do that i’m scared of– of the pain” you ain’t scared of the pain women they wax their eyebrows they do all sorts of crazy shit you’re not scared of the pain what you’re really scared of is doo doo on the dick you’re scared that he’s gonna see that and that’s gonna be all of your shame your inner evil all your secrets and lies sephora can’t help you now but don’t worry ’cause when he puts it in the butt all he’s thinking about is “i just put it in her butt” “i gotta go call my mom my dad dave my grandma” you’re– if you’re married you’re gonna have to do anal eventually ok you have to because you gotta change it up you gotta change it up so that you don’t cheat on each other you gotta keep it interesting if you put it in different holes maybe you’ll feel like you’re fucking different people i was very sexually active in my 20s and as a result i’m a little bit… …stretched out down there ok so when i finally did anal i just felt like i got a second chance at life you know i was like “oh my god it’s like i’m going back in time” ♪ a whole new world ♪ it was magical a big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate yeah like a conqueror i just wanted to… now if you haven’t done it before ladies go home and treat yourself do it tonight you only live once yolo just sneak your– just give your man a little– a little pushpush in the tushtush just give him a little atari you know and you’ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first you’ll get a lot of “no no no no please no really i don’t– no i don’t i don’t no” they get all squirmy wormy because… they’re scared they’re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed and they like it that then it might mean that they’re gay and i like that fear that shit turns me on you know especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure oh my god and you just see the look in the man’s eye like he’s discovered nirvana and it’s like you’re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole and then you as the woman in his eyes just become the lord of the rim you know my husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me when– when i’ve asked him to spank me this is what he does “hey hey are you ok are you all right you know i respect you right” i’m like “yes i know you respect me and that’s why you need to abuse me ok” ‘cause it’s the most strongheaded loudmouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed women who are ceos they just wanna be roughed around they just want their– glasses always means the woman wants some– it’s because we’re so in control all the time that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control you know like “i don’t wanna die don’t kill me i don’t wanna die” but i also don’t want to be sure that i’m gonna live you know i just wanna be out of control for once just– just choke me enough so that i can’t talk ‘cause if i can talk i’m gonna tell you what to do and i’m tired of being the boss i’m the boss all the time so in the bedroom you be the boss yes because i’m the real boss and i told you so motherfucker so do it sheryl sandberg that woman who wrote lean in has had such a big impact that now because of her there is a ban on the word “bossy” in elementary schools because according to her it’s sexist to use the word “bossy” because boys are never called bossy so now instead of saying “you’re bossy” you’re supposed to say “you have executive leadership skills” which is a very roundabout way of saying “you’re a little cunt” i’m just waiting for the right moment to like become a housewife financially you know i want my husband to get us to like a certain point financially i wanna get to the point as a couple where i can comfortably afford sliced mango know what i’m talking about i’m talking about that whole foods mango that 10abox whole foods mango that was sliced by white people that’s the kind of income bracket i’m striving for that’s when you know you’ve made it when you’re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named noah i want noah mango… …rebecca kiwi danielle pineapple you know what else i want i wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk see a quarter and just keep on walking like a princess i have some useful advice for all my asianamerican brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteran so i don’t know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah it’s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics… don’t get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you there’s– none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear that’s not the case with male comics once they have a baby they’ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they’ll be like “guys i just had this fucking baby that baby’s a little piece of shit it’s so annoying and boring” and all these other shitty dads in the audience are like “that’s hilarious i identify” and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper ’cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby’s head shredding it up she’s busy so i don’t know what’s gonna happen to me you know a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were like “ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become– you’re gonna disappear and you’re gonna become some lame stayathome mom” i was like “yeah that’s the dream” that’s the point this is the ultimate trap i won you know another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were like “why are you gonna have a kid why don’t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached” i was like “yeah that’s cool… until my husband dies” which he’s definitely gonna before me because i’m a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until i’m a billion i’m guaranteed like a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase “black don’t crack” well asian don’t die we don’t die especially the women we live forever and you know why we’re such bad drivers because we’re trying to die we’re like “yeah let me see how invincible i really am” “imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely” “i’m gonna make a right turn– i changed my mind it’s a uturn” “i changed my mind again it’s a oturn” every time i get into a car accident… …i’m like “oh my god not again” i need to hide my face so that everybody doesn’t see that it’s what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess there’s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood there’s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i don’t know what’s wrong with me but i’m still here you know i need to have children to keep me company when i get older it’s lonely my mom is 80 going through a full blown midlife crisis ‘cause she knows that she’s got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead i’m just kidding she doesn’t have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when i’m older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isn’t around to support me anymore i’m not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living that’s not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they don’t give a fuck they got no shame they’re like “i’m just gonna recycle… go bald… go to the park do this shit” they do that ’cause it’s a free activity for them they do it in their– their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see who’s gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are like the tupac and biggie of longevity i also decided to have a kid because uh i’m only 33 which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it– and it scared me like i’m only 33 and… …my pussy is not as wet as it used to be it’s very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were 18 years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just… “i slime you i slime you ghostbusters” i don’t know what kind of mother i’m gonna be i’m– i’m 33 and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that… is most likely my fault because when i was in my 20s i ate plan b like skittles so my uterus probably looked like a smoker’s lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act like everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich “uh mmm” they watch property brothers scratch “what’s crackin’ mmm” every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is “when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to…” “…smell my fingers” nature made you urgently curious to protect you ’cause you gotta check that it’s all good in the hood if it’s too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmd when my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were like “oh my god that’s so hot you guys doin’ a lot of fuckin’” no dude that’s– that’s shit you do in your 20s ok when in– when you’re in your 30s and you’ve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin’ it tells you when it’s easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was like only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be like “we’re not fuckin’ i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out it’s like ‘release the kraken” and they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship you know and um… yeah and most of the time like we wouldn’t even have sex ’cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and i’d be like “ok it’s go time” and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex it’s not because they’re in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex it’s because they’re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesn’t have to see the expression on my face that says “please hurry the fuck up” and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish it’s when they get that… that stupidass look on their face… …where they look like they just got bit by a zombie just… and then because we’re hippies i’d be like “hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok” and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him… and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards… to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me that’s right ‘cause i don’t wanna work anymore i’m very grateful to be pregnant and to be… this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that they’re like “oh my god that’s so dark and terrible i can’t believe that” i’m 33 girl when you’re 33 you’ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage it’s super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn’t feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom– she’s from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was like “uh yeah where i’m from that’s like losing a pair of shoes it’s whatevs ok” and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me “oh my god i see two sacks which means you’re having twins” and i was like “no” and then she said “but what i don’t see is a heartbeat” and i was like “yes” “the lord is mysterious” don’t feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds i’ve picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women won’t let their husbands watch when they’re going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was like “you look” “you watch the whole thing” and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for 30 days he took me to see beyoncé he bought me a bike off of craigslist that’s my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for 30 days i finally had the marriage i always wanted i’m scared about giving childbirth though i’m– i’m very very scared of childbirth that’s why i’m going to hire a doula you know what that is you know what a doula is that’s a white hippie witch… …that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser söze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying “ali did you know that you’re gonna poop on the table” i was like “yeah i look forward to it” i’m all backed up from holding in my shit at work i can’t wait to cleanse it makes sense like that you– that that happens because when you’re in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think that’s enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay that’s the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasn’t even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house “hey can you wash the dishes” “no” “can you water the plants” “i am not doing jack shit anymore i’m busy makin’ a eyeball ok are you makin’ a foot i didn’t think so you change the channel” i can already see how there’s like this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor’s appointments with me “oh my god i can’t believe he comes to all your doctor’s appointments he is so supportive” guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me i’m the star of the show there’s nothing for the camera to see if i’m not there but he’s the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant i’m a bad mommy you know i– i– i like i berate my husband on like a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me i’m fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis… to keep him down so that he doesn’t believe that he’s worthy of another woman’s affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people don’t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant you know your nipples get huge and dark i didn’t know that i didn’t know that they get dark so that the baby can see like a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then you know they get big– they get big like fingers like “you you you owe me money you” my nipples look like whoppers now and naked i look like a minion but i’m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing it now that i’m seven and a half months pregnant my pussy’s all wet again but it’s different it’s not like when i was 18 years old when it was like really hot you know and i was like “why is it different” and i looked it up and my pussy’s all wet again because my– my body’s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it that’s not the same when it’s straight up soldier glue when it’s neosporin so you know i– i in– previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy who’s like way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and uh two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was 70000 in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out he’s the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enron’d my ass and now if i don’t work we die why else do you think i’m performing seven and a half months pregnant all right i’ve been ali wong

            "i have a hoarding problem which i’m hoping is the center of all of my other problems i’m hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictator’s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade ’cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you’re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communists\n",
            "the last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit don’t ever do that with your mom it was like the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments … manual the manual she don’t even know… where the calculator is those of you under  probably don’t know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost like  and everybody thought it was like this judy jetson’s laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was like the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like “you never know when you might need this” and i was like “but… i do know… that i’m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die” “and i’m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah that’s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success” i grew up a lot this past year uh this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really i’m the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen they’re sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and uh he’s– he’s much better looking than me he’s way out of my league and i saw him and i was like “oh my god who is that” and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was like “oh my god i’m gonna trap his ass” “going to trap his ass” and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was like “all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden” when really it’s a public park… …that has hosted many reggae fests… …and has even accidentally let… two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing… for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to… it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had like we had… we had so much chemistry he was like “hey wassup” i was like “wassup” and we– the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was like “hey can you drop me off” i was like “where” he was like “at the park” and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was like “oh no” “i just fucked a homeless dude again” my husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who like you know wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they like to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory it’s… too much i don’t know what’s wrong with these bitches i get it you know because being with a white dude you feel very… you feel very picturesque when you’re with a white dude you know you feel like you’re in a wes anderson movie or something and you know white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff like that and it’s very you know it’s hot hookin’ up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel like i’m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement… …you know just right there through the money hole and just… and then also he’s so vulnerable down there i’m like “i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer” you know but i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home… and be racist together you get to say whatever you like you don’t gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese i’m halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people it’s… amazing it’s what love is built on you know my last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was like “hold it you guys aren’t mexican” asianamerican men are very underrated i don’t know why people don’t go for them they’re the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down it’s like making love to a dolphin oh my god it’s so smooth just like a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night you know oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards it’s all red and inflamed and you’re like “i did not ask to be exfoliated today” “this is the last time i go on jdate more like loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi” and then asian men no body odor none they just smell like responsibility that’s where the umami flavor comes from i think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding uh between each other because he’s halffilipino and halfjapanese and i’m halfchinese and halfvietnamese so we’re both halffancy asian… …and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things like host olympics jungle asians host diseases it’s… it’s different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse uh you know learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up like filipino carlton ok so he didn’t know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was like “it’s authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp” i was like “it’s not authentic ok” you can tell first and foremost by the name ’cause it don’t got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused i grew up going to private school too him and i are both total like private school asians we both are big hippies too we like to backpack through southeast asia we like to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats that’s right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit like that uh we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes like freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread that’s like… …a thousand percent of your daily fiber… and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about… …supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so it’s funny right because he’s asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do… makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of asian people like we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall… and neither of us know what the fuck they mean we’re like “oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house him and i had been dating for four years and i– i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose… because… i had been pressuring him to do it so you know i just had this wacky women’s intuition that’s how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the man’s head first passively and then if he doesn’t get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because you know that you’re too old and it’s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so you’re like “i’m just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like “shut the fuck up fine will you marry me” and then afterwards the woman is always like “oh my god he proposed” “it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something… that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day” let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page… he’s probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday… because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread that’s how rotten i was people are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband i’m a completely different person you– like you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him i’m very soft and like very nurturing and very domestic we’ve been together now for five years and for five years i’ve packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that he’d become dependent on me ‘cause he graduated from harvard business school and i don’t wanna work anymore i don’t i straight up don’t wanna work anymore i don’t feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future ‘cause i don’t wanna work anymore i’ve been reading that book by sheryl sandberg she’s the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i don’t wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like “we’re dumb women we don’t know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen” “‘cause we’re too stupid to have any real responsibility” and then all these women had to show off and be like “we could do it we could do anything” “bitch shut up” “don’t tell them the secret” they ruined it for us and now we’re expected to work when i hear the phrase “doubleincome household” i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and they’re like “but ali we have so many more options now” oh you don’t think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it a lot of my friends when we walk around together they’ll get very judgmental about housewives that we’ll see on the street and they’ll be like “look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants” i’m like “that bitch is a genius” “she’s not a housewife she’s retired” i do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is… it’s a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers it’s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs it’s probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they don’t gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they don’t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they don’t gotta… …ten times a day every day… like you’re about to eat a sadass meal they don’t gotta do that they don’t gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that’s not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole it’s basically like wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired ’cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed ’cause you’re paranoid that your coworker’s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and you’re like “oh no courtney’s listening she’s waiting she’s timing me” and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks like it’s been run over by the goonies housewives they don’t gotta muffle their shit too they don’t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they don’t gotta try to you know squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they don’t gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they want you know it’s– it’s very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say “you need to get to work on time” i was like “you need to eat bananas” “i saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you don’t try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit together” my fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently um and he was like “hey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had” i was like “why you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that don’t your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said ‘i do’ what i really meant was ‘oh i’m done” i’m done i don’t wanna work anymore and i’m not dieting anymore since i got married last year i’ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since that’s right and just fulfilling my destiny which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes like mrs pacman just… let’s redecorate i gave up a lot of myself when i got married i’m a– i’m a disgusting pervert i’m a pervert i’m a gross filthy animal and i think it’s because i started watching porn at a very young age and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that… yyou get sicker and sicker and sicker the images you crave get sicker and sicker and sicker but it’s ok because the internet will always catch up to you i broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back i was like “uh you’re a idiot dude do you realize that if i went on craigslist… and posted ‘tiny asian female seeking anal…’ the internet would crash” “and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode” they would explode a lot of women get really you know… freaked out about anal and they’re like “oh i don’t wanna do that i’m scared of– of the pain” you ain’t scared of the pain women they wax their eyebrows they do all sorts of crazy shit you’re not scared of the pain what you’re really scared of is doo doo on the dick you’re scared that he’s gonna see that and that’s gonna be all of your shame your inner evil all your secrets and lies sephora can’t help you now but don’t worry ’cause when he puts it in the butt all he’s thinking about is “i just put it in her butt” “i gotta go call my mom my dad dave my grandma” you’re– if you’re married you’re gonna have to do anal eventually ok you have to because you gotta change it up you gotta change it up so that you don’t cheat on each other you gotta keep it interesting if you put it in different holes maybe you’ll feel like you’re fucking different people i was very sexually active in my  and as a result i’m a little bit… …stretched out down there ok so when i finally did anal i just felt like i got a second chance at life you know i was like “oh my god it’s like i’m going back in time” ♪ a whole new world ♪ it was magical a big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate yeah like a conqueror i just wanted to… now if you haven’t done it before ladies go home and treat yourself do it tonight you only live once yolo just sneak your– just give your man a little– a little pushpush in the tushtush just give him a little atari you know and you’ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first you’ll get a lot of “no no no no please no really i don’t– no i don’t i don’t no” they get all squirmy wormy because… they’re scared they’re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed and they like it that then it might mean that they’re gay and i like that fear that shit turns me on you know especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure oh my god and you just see the look in the man’s eye like he’s discovered nirvana and it’s like you’re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole and then you as the woman in his eyes just become the lord of the rim you know my husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me when– when i’ve asked him to spank me this is what he does “hey hey are you ok are you all right you know i respect you right” i’m like “yes i know you respect me and that’s why you need to abuse me ok” ‘cause it’s the most strongheaded loudmouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed women who are ceos they just wanna be roughed around they just want their– glasses always means the woman wants some– it’s because we’re so in control all the time that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control you know like “i don’t wanna die don’t kill me i don’t wanna die” but i also don’t want to be sure that i’m gonna live you know i just wanna be out of control for once just– just choke me enough so that i can’t talk ‘cause if i can talk i’m gonna tell you what to do and i’m tired of being the boss i’m the boss all the time so in the bedroom you be the boss yes because i’m the real boss and i told you so motherfucker so do it sheryl sandberg that woman who wrote lean in has had such a big impact that now because of her there is a ban on the word “bossy” in elementary schools because according to her it’s sexist to use the word “bossy” because boys are never called bossy so now instead of saying “you’re bossy” you’re supposed to say “you have executive leadership skills” which is a very roundabout way of saying “you’re a little cunt” i’m just waiting for the right moment to like become a housewife financially you know i want my husband to get us to like a certain point financially i wanna get to the point as a couple where i can comfortably afford sliced mango know what i’m talking about i’m talking about that whole foods mango that  whole foods mango that was sliced by white people that’s the kind of income bracket i’m striving for that’s when you know you’ve made it when you’re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named noah i want noah mango… …rebecca kiwi danielle pineapple you know what else i want i wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk see a quarter and just keep on walking like a princess i have some useful advice for all my asianamerican brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteran so i don’t know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah it’s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics… don’t get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you there’s– none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear that’s not the case with male comics once they have a baby they’ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they’ll be like “guys i just had this fucking baby that baby’s a little piece of shit it’s so annoying and boring” and all these other shitty dads in the audience are like “that’s hilarious i identify” and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper ’cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby’s head shredding it up she’s busy so i don’t know what’s gonna happen to me you know a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were like “ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become– you’re gonna disappear and you’re gonna become some lame stayathome mom” i was like “yeah that’s the dream” that’s the point this is the ultimate trap i won you know another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were like “why are you gonna have a kid why don’t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached” i was like “yeah that’s cool… until my husband dies” which he’s definitely gonna before me because i’m a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until i’m a billion i’m guaranteed like a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase “black don’t crack” well asian don’t die we don’t die especially the women we live forever and you know why we’re such bad drivers because we’re trying to die we’re like “yeah let me see how invincible i really am” “imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely” “i’m gonna make a right turn– i changed my mind it’s a uturn” “i changed my mind again it’s a oturn” every time i get into a car accident… …i’m like “oh my god not again” i need to hide my face so that everybody doesn’t see that it’s what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess there’s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood there’s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i don’t know what’s wrong with me but i’m still here you know i need to have children to keep me company when i get older it’s lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis ‘cause she knows that she’s got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead i’m just kidding she doesn’t have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when i’m older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isn’t around to support me anymore i’m not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living that’s not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they don’t give a fuck they got no shame they’re like “i’m just gonna recycle… go bald… go to the park do this shit” they do that ’cause it’s a free activity for them they do it in their– their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see who’s gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are like the tupac and biggie of longevity i also decided to have a kid because uh i’m only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it– and it scared me like i’m only  and… …my pussy is not as wet as it used to be it’s very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just… “i slime you i slime you ghostbusters” i don’t know what kind of mother i’m gonna be i’m– i’m  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that… is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b like skittles so my uterus probably looked like a smoker’s lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act like everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich “uh mmm” they watch property brothers scratch “what’s crackin’ mmm” every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is “when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to…” “…smell my fingers” nature made you urgently curious to protect you ’cause you gotta check that it’s all good in the hood if it’s too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmd when my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were like “oh my god that’s so hot you guys doin’ a lot of fuckin’” no dude that’s– that’s shit you do in your  ok when in– when you’re in your  and you’ve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin’ it tells you when it’s easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was like only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be like “we’re not fuckin’ i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out it’s like ‘release the kraken” and they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship you know and um… yeah and most of the time like we wouldn’t even have sex ’cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and i’d be like “ok it’s go time” and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex it’s not because they’re in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex it’s because they’re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesn’t have to see the expression on my face that says “please hurry the fuck up” and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish it’s when they get that… that stupidass look on their face… …where they look like they just got bit by a zombie just… and then because we’re hippies i’d be like “hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok” and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him… and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards… to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me that’s right ‘cause i don’t wanna work anymore i’m very grateful to be pregnant and to be… this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that they’re like “oh my god that’s so dark and terrible i can’t believe that” i’m  girl when you’re  you’ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage it’s super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn’t feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom– she’s from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was like “uh yeah where i’m from that’s like losing a pair of shoes it’s whatevs ok” and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me “oh my god i see two sacks which means you’re having twins” and i was like “no” and then she said “but what i don’t see is a heartbeat” and i was like “yes” “the lord is mysterious” don’t feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds i’ve picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women won’t let their husbands watch when they’re going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was like “you look” “you watch the whole thing” and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyoncé he bought me a bike off of craigslist that’s my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wanted i’m scared about giving childbirth though i’m– i’m very very scared of childbirth that’s why i’m going to hire a doula you know what that is you know what a doula is that’s a white hippie witch… …that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser söze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying “ali did you know that you’re gonna poop on the table” i was like “yeah i look forward to it” i’m all backed up from holding in my shit at work i can’t wait to cleanse it makes sense like that you– that that happens because when you’re in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think that’s enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay that’s the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasn’t even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house “hey can you wash the dishes” “no” “can you water the plants” “i am not doing jack shit anymore i’m busy makin’ a eyeball ok are you makin’ a foot i didn’t think so you change the channel” i can already see how there’s like this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor’s appointments with me “oh my god i can’t believe he comes to all your doctor’s appointments he is so supportive” guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me i’m the star of the show there’s nothing for the camera to see if i’m not there but he’s the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant i’m a bad mommy you know i– i– i like i berate my husband on like a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me i’m fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis… to keep him down so that he doesn’t believe that he’s worthy of another woman’s affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people don’t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant you know your nipples get huge and dark i didn’t know that i didn’t know that they get dark so that the baby can see like a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then you know they get big– they get big like fingers like “you you you owe me money you” my nipples look like whoppers now and naked i look like a minion but i’m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing it now that i’m seven and a half months pregnant my pussy’s all wet again but it’s different it’s not like when i was  years old when it was like really hot you know and i was like “why is it different” and i looked it up and my pussy’s all wet again because my– my body’s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it that’s not the same when it’s straight up soldier glue when it’s neosporin so you know i– i in– previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy who’s like way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and uh two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out he’s the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enron’d my ass and now if i don’t work we die why else do you think i’m performing seven and a half months pregnant all right i’ve been ali wong have a good night everybody thank you your email

            "thank you. thank you. thank you, san francisco. thank you so much. so good to be here. people were surprised when i told ’em i was gonna tape my special in san francisco. said, “why would you do that? that’s the most politically correct city in the world.” not when i’m on stage, it’s not. i love this place. one of my favorite cities to perform in. it’s a good place to hang out. got to walk around a little bit today. saw a baby. saw a baby locked inside the back of a hot car. so it’s been a great day. love that. don’t get me wrong. i’m not a monster. i tried to help the baby. tried to throw a rock through the window. window was down. ruined that baby’s whole weekend. it was worth it. i love san francisco. one of my favorite things is how beautiful all the women are here. yeah. women in san francisco are gorgeous. i say that despite what’s… going on in this crowd tonight. but you guys live here. you guys live here. you’ve seen ’em. i was in a bar last night, saw this beautiful woman. like a supermodel. i walked up, i was like, “hey, where you from? what do you do?” she goes, “oh, me? i live here in san francisco. i’m a brain surgeon.” i don’t know if this makes me sexist, but i was really impressed. you know? i mean… most women… can’t pull off sarcasm. this is gonna be a good show. see, that joke, that joke is a test. to see if you guys are cool or not. that thing about the baby in the car, that’s just me clearing my throat. that joke’s the test. if you guys laugh at that joke, whole show goes great. you don’t laugh at that joke, whole show goes bad. and i’ve had shows go very, very bad. doesn’t matter to me at all. now, this next joke, this next joke is a test to see how cool you are. i, uh… i used to have a son. already some of you see where this is going, that’s good. that’s good. i used to have a little two-year-old son, but he died. the same way eric clapton’s son died. for inspiration. i’m not gonna lie, this is the best that joke has ever done. you guys kinda laughed, then started talking to each other for some reason. then started clapping, that is amazing. most people just boo me. but if you didn’t understand the joke… don’t worry. it’s a complicated joke, a lot of things you gotta know. that joke is like an onion. you’ve gotta know who eric clapton is. not a given these days. you’ve gotta know about his kid. you gotta know how clumsy that little lad was. you gotta know about that terrible fucking song. and then you gotta think all that’s funny. now, i gotta get to know you guys a little bit. starting with you for sure. i can tell you’re a big comedy fan and bat-shit insane. did you just come from the fucking dentist or what? what is your name? – peggy jo. – peggy. peggy, what do you try to do? not a lot, i’m disabled. you’re disabled? i know you’re disabled. is this your husband with you? okay. sir, what do you do, so i can move the fuck on. – i’m an electrician. – you’re an electrician? great. that’s an honorable job. that’s a good job to have. i’m sure you shock the shit out of her on a daily basis. electrician. it’s a wonderful job. there’s a lot of bad jobs out there, i’ll tell you that right now. lot of bad jobs. hell, my uncle john runs a summer camp for… kids about to get molested. i know, right? i know, it sounds awful. sounds awful, but he loves it. he’s like… says he’s never worked a day in his life. doesn’t pay much, but the benefits… do you guys have any kids? how many? i have one, and he has two. okay. you guys ever done that thing where you go online and see how many sex offenders live around you? isn’t it crazy? isn’t it way more than you’d think? you think it might be like one or two. no, it’s like chicken pox. i went online, 15 child molesters. fifteen child molesters within five miles of my apartment. so, why do we always have to meet at my place? and if you’re wondering, “anthony, this is great, but are all of these jokes gonna be about hurting children?” i don’t know, probably. seems like something i would do. i of course live in los angeles. i’ve got a nice place. obviously. my brother’s been staying with me, which has been awful. my brother is crazy. even my neighbors hate him. the other day i opened the door, i caught him masturbating. he looks me right in the eyes and goes, “shut the door.” i said, “get inside.” my family loves it when i put them in jokes. they love it. “anthony, please, put me in your next joke.” “are you sure? i’m gonna make you a pedophile.” “we don’t care. we wanna be part of this thing you’ve got going on.” so i wrote that joke, put my brother in. i’m in chicago, where he lives. after the show, he comes backstage and i say, “mikey, what’d you think about that new joke? did you like the shout out?” and he gets all uncomfortable. he goes, “well, crowd seemed to think it was funny… but i think it’s kinda weird that you got a joke where you wanna fuck me.” and i said, “what, mikey? no! no, mikey. you’re my brother. that’s a joke about you masturbating in front of my house.” and he goes, “yeah, and then you’re like, ‘get back inside.'” just in case you guys are wondering whether my brother’s a fuckin’ idiot. yeah, i’ve got a nice place. try to keep it nice. not always successful. like, i tried getting a puppy. disaster. had to get rid of that puppy. had to get rid of that puppy almost immediately. the first time i left it home alone, the first time i left that puppy home alone, that damn thing tore my entire place apart, shit everywhere, and starved to death. why are you mad? i’m the one who couldn’t get his money back. and this is traditionally where crowds really start to turn on me. after i kill a puppy with neglect. and it’s okay. it’s okay, you can get mad at me. you can hate me. you can hate me and still laugh at me. that’s how talented i am. and i’m used to it. i’m used to it. i once dated a girl who punched me in the face as hard as she could. once dated a girl, punched me right in the face as hard as she could. i didn’t do anything about it. i didn’t say anything about it. i just turned around and left the room. but in my head, in my head, all i was thinking was… “now we’re even.” she was so mad. she got mad at me. she got mad at me ’cause i killed all of her plants. killed every single one of her house plants. and she had told me. she said, “anthony, i’m going out of town for two weeks. give each one of these half a cup of water every other day.” but i’m a dude. all i heard was “two weeks” and “cheat on me.” like my neighbors in l.a… my neighbors in l.a. have got this smokin’ hot 18-year-old daughter. i mean, she’s perfect. but she just got a tattoo of a butterfly over her chest. which is horrible. doesn’t she understand how dumb that’s gonna look some day, all stretched out over my lamp? yeah, that’s a joke. that’s a joke where i’m a serial killer. i’m very open about it. don’t you dare tighten up on me. i hate sensitivity. i hate it. even when little kids get sensitive, that makes me mad. i got a six-year-old nephew. i asked what he wants for his birthday. he said, “uncle anthony, i want you to get me a barbie doll.” i said, “fuck you.” “you six-year-old piece of shit.” and don’t get me wrong. don’t get me wrong, i don’t care if he plays with dolls. he can wear dresses if he wants to. but i’m not getting him a barbie doll. you see, barbie dolls give little boys unrealistic expectations… …of how easy it’s gonna be to tear off a head. i won’t do it. i get really mad when people get sensitive about comedy. if you’re sensitive about comedy, it’s the dumbest thing you can do. i call them the joke police. they always have one rule, one rule they have. you can’t make fun of this right now. after a couple years, they move on to something else, which is why it’s so hypocritical. like the thing today, the thing right now you can’t make fun of, the thing that’s too sensitive at this moment? trans-gendered people. see? you can’t do it. can’t make fun of them. it’s too sensitive. in fact, you can’t even call them “chicks with dicks” anymore. no. no. you have to call them “men who talk too much.” right? but i hear this all the time. people’ll be like, “anthony, that was really funny. but, man, women must hate you. women must come to your shows and hate the shit out of you.” and i always say, “no. no. stupid women hate my shows.” “stupid women hate my shows. smart women… don’t come to my shows.” speaking of which, what’s your name? – what? kim. – kim. – kim, where you from? – san jose. san jose? okay. what do you do, kim? um, i’m a branch manager. – like for a bank? for a pizza hut? – no, for… what? what the fuck? where’d you go to school? – uc santa cruz. – what’d you study? – economics. – economics? okay. you ever gonna use that someday? i had to go to catholic school when i was a kid. hated catholic school. hated catholic school more than anything. the nuns were vicious. they would hit me with a ruler, slap me in the face. anything to defend themselves. you guys loved the shit out of that one, huh? hated school. when i was in the fifth grade, one of my classmates got cancer. came down with the cancer. which was sad. but the story is actually cool and inspiring. every single guy… every single guy in the school, we all… shaved our heads to make fun of him. yeah. no, it was great. it was great, we did it for like a month. we would have kept doin’ it, but you know. you know how cancer gets. you guys ever… you guys ever trace back your family history? go back a couple generations in your family tree, find out embarrassing shit you wish you didn’t know? i traced my family tree back, found that i actually had family fighting on both sides in world war ii. humiliating. the piece-of-shit side of my family fought for the nazi infantry in germany, while the bad-ass jeselniks were here in america spying for the germans. i assume everyone is drinking tonight? – yeah! – yeah! whoo! that’s good. i love to drink. love it. do it all the time, every day, always have. i don’t know where it comes from either. even my parents tell me, when i was just a little baby, i used to climb out of my crib every morning, and then crawl over to the liquor cabinet… to try to spend time with them. i like san francisco, so liberal. so liberal. clap your hands here. clap your hands if you own a gun. san jose is in the house, huh? not too bad. i once asked the crowd in houston that question. they just started firing guns in the air. didn’t even let me finish the question. i don’t own a gun. i’m against guns, to be honest. when i was a kid… when i was a kid, my parents had a gun. my parents said we had to have a gun. gotta have a gun to protect the five children. gotta have a gun to protect our five children. of course, they eventually got rid of it… to protect their four children. i’m not gonna lie, it was fun while it lasted. i was getting pretty good towards the end. man, my parents were strict. mom and dad were strict. my mom and dad once made me smoke an entire pack of cigarettes. an entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting. just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty. i learned a lot from my parents. especially my dad. like, i’ll never forget… the first time i ever got a bad report card in school. first time i got a bad report card, i brought it home, i gave it to my dad and my dad beat me. beat the hell out of me. but i learned something. because the next time i got a bad report card in school, i brought it home and i gave it to my mom. let her take the hit. yeah.\n",
            "my dad was a hard-ass. one of those guys who believed that men just learn by doing things. you know? you don’t take classes. you don’t read the instructions. you just do it and figure it out. like, when i was a kid, i never got to take swimming lessons. no, my dad would pick me up and throw me in the water to teach himself cpr.\n",
            "as a kid, my dad’s prized possession, my dad’s favorite thing in the world growing up? my dad was the proud owner of a mickey mantle rookie card. mickey mantle rookie baseball card, mint condition. kept it between two little pieces of plastic. but i was a kid. i didn’t know any better. one day i took that card to school and i traded it to a classmate for a candy bar. you know what that card is worth today? my relationship with my father.\n",
            "i mean it, my dad was no joke. my dad did not fuck around. my dad did not trust anybody. my dad did not trust anyone. in fact, he had a saying… but he wouldn’t tell me. what, too clever for you? that joke is fuckin’ amazing. last year was a sad year for my family. last year, my mom should’ve been celebrating her 60th birthday. but because of drugs, alcohol and other terrible decisions, we all forgot. it was sad.\n",
            "when i was a kid, i used to fantasize about getting older, growing up and having money, and buying my mom nice things for her birthday. when i was a kid, we were poor. so poor i remember, just so i could go to my senior prom, just so i could go to my senior prom, i had to sell my u.s. passport on the street. sold my passport on the street for 300 bucks to get to go to my prom. of course this was before 9/11 so… my bad, everybody. weird joke to clap for, but sure. my mom actually should’ve been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11. i think.\n",
            "i mean, don’t get me wrong, i loved my mother. she was my mom, of course i loved her. we fought a lot. my mom could be very racist. very racist. and i do not tolerate racism. that’s ignorance and i hate that. when i was a kid, like nine years old, i’d come home after school. once in a while, i’d bring a friend over to play with me at my house. once in a while, i’d bring a black friend over. and when i did that, my mom would act weird. she’d pull me aside and say, “anthony, who’s your new friend? is he a drug dealer?” and i would say, “shut up, mom, that’s racist. put your money away.” i never get to see my family anymore, really. most of them are in jail, to be honest. and we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. ‘cause they’re all in jail for the exact same thing. my testimony. you. – what’s your name? – melissa. – melissa, where you from? – santa clara. – what do you do? – i win things on the radio. – you win things on the radio? – yeah. follow-up question, how’d you get tickets to this? let me ask you this. you ever, uh… you ever find a body in the woods? ever do that? no? it’s okay. i have. i was walking through the woods one day and… some poor bastard had stepped in a bear trap or something. i never told anybody about it. but i went back there a week later, and he was dead. yeah. i do crazy shit like that all the time. what can i say? i’m wacky. the other night i was driving my car. i was driving my car and i ran over a deer… a dear, dear friend. i’m torn constantly. at night, i do shows, but during the day, i’ve got a hobby. during the day, i go from town to town… and i shut down the local abortion clinic. you heard me. i shut down abortion clinics everywhere i go. it’s easy for me. i’m charming. i stand outside the front doors all day long and… consistently underbid them. you guys mad about that one? it’s gonna get so much fuckin’ worse. gotta talk to one more person. you, sir. what’s your name? – allan. – allan, where you from? – frisco. – frisco. i can tell you’re a local ’cause of how cool you are. what do you do, frisco? – i fight fires. i fight fires. – you what? you’re a firefighter? awesome. what do you wanna do? if you could do anything. if you could do any job in the world, what would your dream job be? – travel the world. – travel the world. it’s good to have a dream. i hope you go for it. it doesn’t sound like you’re even gonna get close. i think you should do it. travel the world. do it.\n",
            "everyone should try to live their dream, that’s my point. everyone. i get to live my dream. i mean, not when i’m in san francisco, but for the most part. being a comedian was my dream. ‘cause no one can tell me what to do. that’s all i cared about. most people don’t ever try to live their dream. lot of people try and they fail. which i think is better, more noble, more respectable.\n",
            "i had an uncle. all he ever dreamed about, cared about, talked about… wanted to become an astronaut. fly into space one day. and he went for it. he went for it. and he failed. he blew it. ended up becoming one of those pussies… …on the space shuttle challenger. you guys remember that, right? i think it’s funny. i think it’s funny how the things that happen to us when we’re kids end up staying with us for our entire lives. i got this little niece. when she was three years old, she almost drowned. and now to this day, even ten years later, she still will not go anywhere near me. yeah, i was babysitting her… and trying to do laundry. and she accidentally fell into the washing machine. thought i was quick. i got good reflexes. i thought i got her out before anyone would find out what happened, but nope. turned everything pink. you’re gonna find out a lot about yourselves on this next one. hey, did you guys know… did you guys know that when a newborn baby… when a newborn baby is first born, when it’s fresh out of the womb… it can actually hear and see everything around it… for up to ten seconds after it’s decapitated? yeah. yeah. i never know what to say. i never know what to say to someone after they’ve lost a baby. what do you say to someone after they’ve lost a baby? “oh, i’m sorry for your loss”? doesn’t cut it. “are you gonna be okay?” not even close. that’s why i just keep my mouth shut. let my lawyer do the talking. i’m not good with kids. that’s my point. that’s what this whole thing’s about. i’m not good with kids. not gonna lie. hell, a couple of months ago, i dropped my cousin’s baby. flat-out dropped my cousin’s baby on the ground. but i don’t feel like that was my fault. i don’t feel responsible for that one, you know? who in their right mind… who the hell in their right mind would ever ask me, anthony jeselnik, to be a pallbearer? it’s okay, people hate… people hate dead baby jokes. they hate them. they hate them. it’s like, “anthony, why do you have to tell dead baby jokes? why do you have so many dead baby jokes?” “no one likes them, why do you insist?” well, i’ll tell you why. because dead baby jokes have made me rich. and who was it? who was it who said the first million is the hardest? was it hitler? didn’t see that one coming, did you? that was a good response. most audiences just pretend i didn’t say it. but i like it. i like making hitler jokes. it’s cool for me. i enjoy it. hell, i lost my grandfather. i lost my grandfather in the holocaust museum. it was the holocaust museum of modern art. which is just like a normal holocaust museum, except you walk around all day being like, “oh! i should have thought of that.” my grandmother died about a year ago. and i didn’t think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away. but i was wrong. it was fine. the hard part, the upsetting part… was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted. she wanted to die in the best way possible, like uh… you, radio winner. what’s the best way you can die? this is not a trick question. – in your sleep? – yes, thank you. thank you, everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep. not me. i want to be alert, awake, surrounded by friends, in a house fire. but my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep. we thought that’s how she went. we were all excited for her. but then we did an autopsy. found out she actually died horribly, in the worst way possible. during an autopsy. it was fucked up. yeah. yeah. she always said her grandkids didn’t pay enough attention to her and… and she was right. she was dead on. but i loved my grandma. loved her very much. my grandma taught me about a lot. taught me what religion is. taught me everything you can know about religion, in one quick story. i’ll tell you now. when i graduated from high school… when i graduated, my grandma came to me, gave me a big hug, said, “anthony, i’m so proud of you. you’re my first grandchild to get to go to college. what can i do for you, what can i give you before you go to college?” and i said, “honestly, grandma, all i need from you is money.” yeah, i know you guys have never been, but college is expensive. and my grandma said, “okay, anthony, i understand.” couple months go by. it’s the end of summer. i’m packing up my dad’s car, getting ready to go to school, and my grandma walks up. says, “anthony, here, before you leave, take this.” and she handed me a brand-new bible. king james version. and i said, “thanks, grandma, that’s exactly what we talked about.” i got in the car and i went off to school. couple of weeks go by, i’m hanging out in my dorm room, having a good time, when the phone rings. it’s my grandma. “anthony, just calling to see how college is going.” “grandma, college is the best. i’m having the time of my life. but to be honest, i’m starting to run low on money, and i could use a little bit, like we talked about.” she said, “okay, well let me ask you this: have you been reading your bible?” and i said, “totally, grandma, i’m on chapter four.” she said, “okay, anthony, i guess i’ll talk to you later.” hung up the phone. couple of months go by. now i’m really starting to struggle financially. might have to drop out of school, so i call my grandma in a panic. i say, “please, it’s anthony. i’m having the time of my life in college. but if i wanna graduate, and i do, i need you to send me some money like we talked about.” she said, “anthony, let me ask you this: have you been reading your bible?” and i said, “yes, grandma! i wish it was longer!” and she said, “okay, anthony. i guess i’ll talk to you later.” finally, it’s the end of the school year. i’ve got straight a’s, but i’m dropping out of college, ’cause i have no more money left. and i’m furious, close to tears, cleaning out my dorm room, when the phone rings. it’s my grandma. “anthony, i heard you’re dropping out of school today. how come?” and i said, “you know goddamn well how come, grandma! ‘cause you wouldn’t give me any money.” she said, “anthony, let me ask you this: did you read your bible?” and i just hung up the phone. i was so pissed off. took everything out of that room. last thing i took off the shelf, the last thing i took out of that room, was that bible my grandma had given me. took it off the shelf, held it in my hands, and for the first time, i actually opened it up. and on the very first page, in my grandmother’s handwriting, it said, “fuck you.” thank you everyone. i hope you enjoyed the jokes i prepared for you tonight. and all the jokes i write, they’re all made up, they’re all fake, except for eric clapton and the challenger. everything else… everything else is fake. but everything i’m about to tell you, from here until the end of the show, that’s all true. now… i don’t tell dark jokes because i’m a comedian. i’m a comedian because i tell dark jokes. i’m kind of fucked up, all right? i’ve always been this way. i can’t really help myself. it gets me into trouble a lot. i lose friends. it’s ruined relationships with people in my family. for instance, my grandmother actually did pass away, about six months ago. i did love her very much. she was a big fan of mine. and i was asked to speak at her funeral, which was a horrible mistake. horrible mistake. no one should ever ask me to speak at anyone’s funeral. i asked a friend for advice. was like, “i’ve never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money. how should i handle this?” “anthony, just go up there and tell a story. find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody. and don’t tell a joke. try not to.” so i walked up and was like, “you know what my favorite memory was? when i was like four years old, before i learned to read, grandma would curl up with me on the couch, she had this southern accent, and she would read to me. she would read mark twain to me, and i loved it. like… mark twain out of my grandma’s mouth, it would just come to life.” and then i couldn’t help myself. i said, “and i know my grandma loved it too, because it combined her two favorite things: spending time with her grandchildren, and using the ‘n’ word.” now i promise you… i promise you… until you’ve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wife’s funeral… …at a methodist church in vicksburg, mississippi… you are not a real comedian. i am a real comedian. i am a pure comedian. i think i’m one of the best comedians of all time. but here’s the thing. it doesn’t matter if you believe me. it really doesn’t matter. the important thing is that i would pass a lie detector test. i like to test myself. i like to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but. one of my favorite ways to test myself, i like to joke about tragedies the day that they happen. the day they happen. i don’t believe in too soon. i’m on a tight schedule. and i’m good at it. i’m good at it. like, the day of… the day of the aurora, colorado batman movie theater shooting. the day it happened, i went online, i went on twitter, and i tweeted “other than that, how was the movie?” right? right? nailed it. nailed it. and the reason i get away with that… the reason i get away with stuff like that is i’m just the guy who does it. people are used to it from me. it would be weird if i didn’t make a joke the day of a tragedy. which is why i was very surprised when i got in a lot of trouble the day of the boston marathon. now, i don’t follow the news regularly. but i know the second a tragedy happens because i get 25 text messages saying, “don’t do it.” and whenever i see that… whenever i see that, it makes me sad. it makes me sad ’cause i know something horrible has happened. people will say, “anthony, what’s funny about aurora? what’s funny about the boston marathon? what’s funny about your grandmother’s funeral?” nothing! nothing is funny about those things. that’s where i come in. so i see these texts and i’m like, “oh, no, what happened?” but i also think, “i’ve got a job to do.” so i go online, i start reading about it. i don’t want to watch the footage. but i’ll read about what happened. and i think, “how can i make someone laugh today?” and then i think, “i got it.” i go back on twitter. and i tweet, “guys, today, there are just some lines that should not be crossed.” “especially the finish line.” and again, i think, “nailed it. u.s.a.! u.s.a.!” but then my phone starts to ring. and it’s my boss. or should i say my former boss. and they say, “anthony, this is unacceptable. you are not just a comedian today. you’re also the host of your own tv show, with your name in the title, on our network. you take this joke down right now or you’re fired.” and i say, “go fuck yourselves.” and i meant it. i didn’t get into comedy for money or fame. i know that sounds wrong, because i’m dripping with both. i only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do. and they said… sure. they said, “well, anthony, you don’t understand. you don’t understand at all. if you don’t take this joke down right now, if you don’t delete this joke right now, not only are you fired, but the entire cast and crew of your television show, about a hundred people, they’re also out of a job.” and i’m ashamed to tell you this. i’m embarrassed to admit it. but in that moment, i folded, and i deleted the joke. ‘cause i’m happy to fight for what i believe in. i’m happy to take the consequences for what i’ve done. but what i could not do, cannot do, is walk up to my cameraman and say, “hey, buddy, no work for you on monday. i had this sweet tweet.” couldn’t do it. but as soon as i hit delete, i got mad and i regretted it. i would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now, i’ll tell ya that. and i got mad for betraying myself and everything i believe in. i’m just as mad today as i was then. just as mad. so mad, i had to have a meeting with the network, where they called me in for a little lecture. they’re like, “anthony, we’re family. why are you so upset? can’t you see we did you a favor? don’t you worry about your career?” let me ask you, san francisco, do i seem like i worry about my career? no. you know why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt? because if they’re worried about their money, they wouldn’t have played the lottery in the first fuckin’ place. i do not worry about my career. and they said, “anthony, the problem is when you make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy, it seems like you’re making fun of the victims, and that’s wrong.” but that’s not what i’m doing. because, you see, the day of a tragedy, victims are not on twitter. am i wrong? tell me i’m wrong. the day of a tragedy, victims have got victim shit to do. no one is ever… no one is ever putting on a tourniquet, asking, “hey, are we trending?” no. this is who i’m making fun of when i make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy. the people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet. and they run to their social media, facebook, twitter, whatever they got. and they all write down the exact same thing: “my thoughts and prayers…” “my thoughts and prayers with the people in aurora.” “my thoughts and prayers with the families in boston.” do you know what that’s worth? fucking nothing. fucking less than nothing. less than nothing. you are not giving any of your time, your money or even your compassion. all you are doing, all you are doing, is saying, “don’t forget about me today.” “don’t forget about me.” “lots of crazy distractions in the news, but don’t forget how sad i am.” those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of. they’re like a wedding photographer who only takes selfies. you understand? now i’m sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it. it’s fine. it’s embarrassing, but it’s fun. you can laugh at yourself. it’s not a reason to stop telling jokes. maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it. trust me, that’s fun too. you guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats? well, i guess that’s what makes me me. on my television show, i once did a segment that aired once and only once, before it was banned, called “shark party.” all right? now… some of you enjoyed it, but if you’ve never seen “shark party,” you can never see “shark party.” it’s been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be, so i will explain it to you. i love sharks. i love sharks more than anything. people… people i can barely fucking tolerate. every single year, 100 million sharks are killed by human beings. every year, 20, 25 people killed by sharks? so when i hear about a shark attack, i’m like, “fuck, yeah.” win one for the home team. so as soon as i get this show where i can do what i want, i say, “you know what? i want to have a shark party. as soon as there’s a shark attack, we’re having a shark party.” and i get lucky. about a month into my run, this guy from new zealand gets eaten by a great white, the champagne of sharks. and i know exactly what to do. i’ve already got the script written. i walk on stage, in front of the cameras. i say, “ladies and gentlemen, this guy from new zealand has been eaten by a great white shark. it’s time for a shark party.” lights go down, music comes up. six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me, and we all start dancing. for way too long. a stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance. very tasteful. and then i stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten. which, in retrospect, is where it all went wrong. but i get to say my favorite thing i’ve ever said on television: “smile, you son of a bitch. shark party.” and in america, where i’m famous for those types of shenanigans… everybody was like, “anthony, that was fucked up.” “it was fucked up to see you dance.” end of controversy. however, in new zealand, where they don’t get my show, they’ve never seen me, and frankly, they don’t get out much… the new zealand media takes the video… and they show it to the guy’s family. and they say, “what do you guys think about this?” and they say, “crikey,” or whatever the fuck they say over there. the point is, all of new zealand, all of new zealand rises up against me. all 45 of those cunts rise up. and start threatening my life. now, i don’t read the things that people write about me on the internet. but i pay people who do. and they come to me, and they’re like, “we’ve got some terrible news. please sit down.” they say, “you are getting a lot of death threats online from new zealand because of ‘shark party.'” and i was like, “really? new zealand wants to kill me? that’s weird because they didn’t even kill the shark.” i said, “how many death threats am i getting?” and they were like “oh, all of them. you are getting all of the death threats. what do you want us to do? we can send someone to talk to them. extra security? what do you want?” i said, “no, forget about it. leave it alone, don’t worry.” this might be hard for some to understand. i’ve said it several times tonight. everyone is going to die. i know full well i am going to die. and most of us don’t get to choose how we check out. but if i die because someone murders me over one of my jokes? best case scenario. if somebody murders me over one of my jokes, i immediately become a legend. i’m a comedy god. the mount rushmore of comedy is me, four times. i said, “come on then.” my security guys are like, “okay, anthony, well, just so you know, that is the dumbest thing we’ve ever heard.” “but you’re the boss. okay.” and they leave. and then the next day they come back. and they say “anthony, sorry to bother you again. i know you didn’t care yesterday, but it’s gotten much worse. you’re gonna wanna hear this.” they say, “someone from new zealand tracked down your mom and dad’s phone number and address in pittsburgh, posted that online… and now your entire family is getting death threats from new zealand.” and i have to admit, that had never occurred to me before. it never crossed my mind… that my family, my loved ones, would ever pay the price, be caught in harm’s way, for something i’ve done or i’ve joked about. and honestly, i would cut my throat for my jokes. i would give my life for what i do. but if anyone, and i mean this for a fact, if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone i cared about because of a joke i’ve made? even better. this man is fantastic\n",
            "i watched the show 10 times  and i laughed so much everytime except for the eric clapton joke and sharky party all is forgivable.  great material. so a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is okay but a joke about a famous musician’s son falling to his death isn’t?  where are your priorities? they’re just jokes.  it’s just syllables formed together.  they’re just words. people are monsters, these are just words your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * \n",

            "thank you. thank you. thank you, san francisco. thank you so much. so good to be here. people were surprised when i told ’em i was gonna tape my special in san francisco. said, “why would you do that? that’s the most politically correct city in the world.” not when i’m on stage, it’s not. i love this place. one of my favorite cities to perform in. it’s a good place to hang out. got to walk around a little bit today. saw a baby. saw a baby locked inside the back of a hot car. so it’s been a great day. love that. don’t get me wrong. i’m not a monster. i tried to help the baby. tried to throw a rock through the window. window was down. ruined that baby’s whole weekend. it was worth it. i love san francisco. one of my favorite things is how beautiful all the women are here. yeah. women in san francisco are gorgeous. i say that despite what’s… going on in this crowd tonight. but you guys live here. you guys live here. you’ve seen ’em. i was in a bar last night, saw this beautiful woman. like a supermodel. i walked up, i was like, “hey, where you from? what do you do?” she goes, “oh, me? i live here in san francisco. i’m a brain surgeon.” i don’t know if this makes me sexist, but i was really impressed. you know? i mean… most women… can’t pull off sarcasm. this is gonna be a good show. see, that joke, that joke is a test. to see if you guys are cool or not. that thing about the baby in the car, that’s just me clearing my throat. that joke’s the test. if you guys laugh at that joke, whole show goes great. you don’t laugh at that joke, whole show goes bad. and i’ve had shows go very, very bad. doesn’t matter to me at all. now, this next joke, this next joke is a test to see how cool you are. i, uh… i used to have a son. already some of you see where this is going, that’s good. that’s good. i used to have a little two-year-old son, but he died. the same way eric clapton’s son died. for inspiration. i’m not gonna lie, this is the best that joke has ever done. you guys kinda laughed, then started talking to each other for some reason. then started clapping, that is amazing. most people just boo me. but if you didn’t understand the joke… don’t worry. it’s a complicated joke, a lot of things you gotta know. that joke is like an onion. you’ve gotta know who eric clapton is. not a given these days. you’ve gotta know about his kid. you gotta know how clumsy that little lad was. you gotta know about that terrible fucking song. and then you gotta think all that’s funny. now, i gotta get to know you guys a little bit. starting with you for sure. i can tell you’re a big comedy fan and bat-shit insane. did you just come from the fucking dentist or what? what is your name? – peggy jo. – peggy. peggy, what do you try to do? not a lot, i’m disabled. you’re disabled? i know you’re disabled. is this your husband with you? okay. sir, what do you do, so i can move the fuck on. – i’m an electrician. – you’re an electrician? great. that’s an honorable job. that’s a good job to have. i’m sure you shock the shit out of her on a daily basis. electrician. it’s a wonderful job. there’s a lot of bad jobs out there, i’ll tell you that right now. lot of bad jobs. hell, my uncle john runs a summer camp for… kids about to get molested. i know, right? i know, it sounds awful. sounds awful, but he loves it. he’s like… says he’s never worked a day in his life. doesn’t pay much, but the benefits… do you guys have any kids? how many? i have one, and he has two. okay. you guys ever done that thing where you go online and see how many sex offenders live around you? isn’t it crazy? isn’t it way more than you’d think? you think it might be like one or two. no, it’s like chicken pox. i went online, 15 child molesters. fifteen child molesters within five miles of my apartment. so, why do we always have to meet at my place? and if you’re wondering, “anthony, this is great, but are all of these jokes gonna be about hurting children?” i don’t know, probably. seems like something i would do. i of course live in los angeles. i’ve got a nice place. obviously. my brother’s been staying with me, which has been awful. my brother is crazy. even my neighbors hate him. the other day i opened the door, i caught him masturbating. he looks me right in the eyes and goes, “shut the door.” i said, “get inside.” my family loves it when i put them in jokes. they love it. “anthony, please, put me in your next joke.” “are you sure? i’m gonna make you a pedophile.” “we don’t care. we wanna be part of this thing you’ve got going on.” so i wrote that joke, put my brother in. i’m in chicago, where he lives. after the show, he comes backstage and i say, “mikey, what’d you think about that new joke? did you like the shout out?” and he gets all uncomfortable. he goes, “well, crowd seemed to think it was funny… but i think it’s kinda weird that you got a joke where you wanna fuck me.” and i said, “what, mikey? no! no, mikey. you’re my brother. that’s a joke about you masturbating in front of my house.” and he goes, “yeah, and then you’re like, ‘get back inside.'” just in case you guys are wondering whether my brother’s a fuckin’ idiot. yeah, i’ve got a nice place. try to keep it nice. not always successful. like, i tried getting a puppy. disaster. had to get rid of that puppy. had to get rid of that puppy almost immediately. the first time i left it home alone, the first time i left that puppy home alone, that damn thing tore my entire place apart, shit everywhere, and starved to death. why are you mad? i’m the one who couldn’t get his money back. and this is traditionally where crowds really start to turn on me. after i kill a puppy with neglect. and it’s okay. it’s okay, you can get mad at me. you can hate me. you can hate me and still laugh at me. that’s how talented i am. and i’m used to it. i’m used to it. i once dated a girl who punched me in the face as hard as she could. once dated a girl, punched me right in the face as hard as she could. i didn’t do anything about it. i didn’t say anything about it. i just turned around and left the room. but in my head, in my head, all i was thinking was… “now we’re even.” she was so mad. she got mad at me. she got mad at me ’cause i killed all of her plants. killed every single one of her house plants. and she had told me. she said, “anthony, i’m going out of town for two weeks. give each one of these half a cup of water every other day.” but i’m a dude. all i heard was “two weeks” and “cheat on me.” like my neighbors in l.a… my neighbors in l.a. have got this smokin’ hot 18-year-old daughter. i mean, she’s perfect. but she just got a tattoo of a butterfly over her chest. which is horrible. doesn’t she understand how dumb that’s gonna look some day, all stretched out over my lamp? yeah, that’s a joke. that’s a joke where i’m a serial killer. i’m very open about it. don’t you dare tighten up on me. i hate sensitivity. i hate it. even when little kids get sensitive, that makes me mad. i got a six-year-old nephew. i asked what he wants for his birthday. he said, “uncle anthony, i want you to get me a barbie doll.” i said, “fuck you.” “you six-year-old piece of shit.” and don’t get me wrong. don’t get me wrong, i don’t care if he plays with dolls. he can wear dresses if he wants to. but i’m not getting him a barbie doll. you see, barbie dolls give little boys unrealistic expectations… …of how easy it’s gonna be to tear off a head. i won’t do it. i get really mad when people get sensitive about comedy. if you’re sensitive about comedy, it’s the dumbest thing you can do. i call them the joke police. they always have one rule, one rule they have. you can’t make fun of this right now. after a couple years, they move on to something else, which is why it’s so hypocritical. like the thing today, the thing right now you can’t make fun of, the thing that’s too sensitive at this moment? trans-gendered people. see? you can’t do it. can’t make fun of them. it’s too sensitive. in fact, you can’t even call them “chicks with dicks” anymore. no. no. you have to call them “men who talk too much.” right? but i hear this all the time. people’ll be like, “anthony, that was really funny. but, man, women must hate you. women must come to your shows and hate the shit out of you.” and i always say, “no. no. stupid women hate my shows.” “stupid women hate my shows. smart women… don’t come to my shows.” speaking of which, what’s your name? – what? kim. – kim. – kim, where you from? – san jose. san jose? okay. what do you do, kim? um, i’m a branch manager. – like for a bank? for a pizza hut? – no, for… what? what the fuck? where’d you go to school? – uc santa cruz. – what’d you study? – economics. – economics? okay. you ever gonna use that someday? i had to go to catholic school when i was a kid. hated catholic school. hated catholic school more than anything. the nuns were vicious. they would hit me with a ruler, slap me in the face. anything to defend themselves. you guys loved the shit out of that one, huh? hated school. when i was in the fifth grade, one of my classmates got cancer. came down with the cancer. which was sad. but the story is actually cool and inspiring. every single guy… every single guy in the school, we all… shaved our heads to make fun of him. yeah. no, it was great. it was great, we did it for like a month. we would have kept doin’ it, but you know. you know how cancer gets. you guys ever… you guys ever trace back your family history? go back a couple generations in your family tree, find out embarrassing shit you wish you didn’t know? i traced my family tree back, found that i actually had family fighting on both sides in world war ii. humiliating. the piece-of-shit side of my family fought for the nazi infantry in germany, while the bad-ass jeselniks were here in america spying for the germans. i assume everyone is drinking tonight? – yeah! – yeah! whoo! that’s good. i love to drink. love it. do it all the time, every day, always have. i don’t know where it comes from either. even my parents tell me, when i was just a little baby, i used to climb out of my crib every morning, and then crawl over to the liquor cabinet… to try to spend time with them. i like san francisco, so liberal. so liberal. clap your hands here. clap your hands if you own a gun. san jose is in the house, huh? not too bad. i once asked the crowd in houston that question. they just started firing guns in the air. didn’t even let me finish the question. i don’t own a gun. i’m against guns, to be honest. when i was a kid… when i was a kid, my parents had a gun. my parents said we had to have a gun. gotta have a gun to protect the five children. gotta have a gun to protect our five children. of course, they eventually got rid of it… to protect their four children. i’m not gonna lie, it was fun while it lasted. i was getting pretty good towards the end. man, my parents were strict. mom and dad were strict. my mom and dad once made me smoke an entire pack of cigarettes. an entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting. just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty. i learned a lot from my parents. especially my dad. like, i’ll never forget… the first time i ever got a bad report card in school. first time i got a bad report card, i brought it home, i gave it to my dad and my dad beat me. beat the hell out of me. but i learned something. because the next time i got a bad report card in school, i brought it home and i gave it to my mom. let her take the hit. yeah.\n",
            "my dad was a hard-ass. one of those guys who believed that men just learn by doing things. you know? you don’t take classes. you don’t read the instructions. you just do it and figure it out. like, when i was a kid, i never got to take swimming lessons. no, my dad would pick me up and throw me in the water to teach himself cpr.\n",
            "as a kid, my dad’s prized possession, my dad’s favorite thing in the world growing up? my dad was the proud owner of a mickey mantle rookie card. mickey mantle rookie baseball card, mint condition. kept it between two little pieces of plastic. but i was a kid. i didn’t know any better. one day i took that card to school and i traded it to a classmate for a candy bar. you know what that card is worth today? my relationship with my father.\n",
            "i mean it, my dad was no joke. my dad did not fuck around. my dad did not trust anybody. my dad did not trust anyone. in fact, he had a saying… but he wouldn’t tell me. what, too clever for you? that joke is fuckin’ amazing. last year was a sad year for my family. last year, my mom should’ve been celebrating her 60th birthday. but because of drugs, alcohol and other terrible decisions, we all forgot. it was sad.\n",
            "when i was a kid, i used to fantasize about getting older, growing up and having money, and buying my mom nice things for her birthday. when i was a kid, we were poor. so poor i remember, just so i could go to my senior prom, just so i could go to my senior prom, i had to sell my u.s. passport on the street. sold my passport on the street for 300 bucks to get to go to my prom. of course this was before 9/11 so… my bad, everybody. weird joke to clap for, but sure. my mom actually should’ve been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11. i think.\n",
            "i mean, don’t get me wrong, i loved my mother. she was my mom, of course i loved her. we fought a lot. my mom could be very racist. very racist. and i do not tolerate racism. that’s ignorance and i hate that. when i was a kid, like nine years old, i’d come home after school. once in a while, i’d bring a friend over to play with me at my house. once in a while, i’d bring a black friend over. and when i did that, my mom would act weird. she’d pull me aside and say, “anthony, who’s your new friend? is he a drug dealer?” and i would say, “shut up, mom, that’s racist. put your money away.” i never get to see my family anymore, really. most of them are in jail, to be honest. and we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. ‘cause they’re all in jail for the exact same thing. my testimony. you. – what’s your name? – melissa. – melissa, where you from? – santa clara. – what do you do? – i win things on the radio. – you win things on the radio? – yeah. follow-up question, how’d you get tickets to this? let me ask you this. you ever, uh… you ever find a body in the woods? ever do that? no? it’s okay. i have. i was walking through the woods one day and… some poor bastard had stepped in a bear trap or something. i never told anybody about it. but i went back there a week later, and he was dead. yeah. i do crazy shit like that all the time. what can i say? i’m wacky. the other night i was driving my car. i was driving my car and i ran over a deer… a dear, dear friend. i’m torn constantly. at night, i do shows, but during the day, i’ve got a hobby. during the day, i go from town to town… and i shut down the local abortion clinic. you heard me. i shut down abortion clinics everywhere i go. it’s easy for me. i’m charming. i stand outside the front doors all day long and… consistently underbid them. you guys mad about that one? it’s gonna get so much fuckin’ worse. gotta talk to one more person. you, sir. what’s your name? – allan. – allan, where you from? – frisco. – frisco. i can tell you’re a local ’cause of how cool you are. what do you do, frisco? – i fight fires. i fight fires. – you what? you’re a firefighter? awesome. what do you wanna do? if you could do anything. if you could do any job in the world, what would your dream job be? – travel the world. – travel the world. it’s good to have a dream. i hope you go for it. it doesn’t sound like you’re even gonna get close. i think you should do it. travel the world. do it.\n",
            "everyone should try to live their dream, that’s my point. everyone. i get to live my dream. i mean, not when i’m in san francisco, but for the most part. being a comedian was my dream. ‘cause no one can tell me what to do. that’s all i cared about. most people don’t ever try to live their dream. lot of people try and they fail. which i think is better, more noble, more respectable.\n",
            "i had an uncle. all he ever dreamed about, cared about, talked about… wanted to become an astronaut. fly into space one day. and he went for it. he went for it. and he failed. he blew it. ended up becoming one of those pussies… …on the space shuttle challenger. you guys remember that, right? i think it’s funny. i think it’s funny how the things that happen to us when we’re kids end up staying with us for our entire lives. i got this little niece. when she was three years old, she almost drowned. and now to this day, even ten years later, she still will not go anywhere near me. yeah, i was babysitting her… and trying to do laundry. and she accidentally fell into the washing machine. thought i was quick. i got good reflexes. i thought i got her out before anyone would find out what happened, but nope. turned everything pink. you’re gonna find out a lot about yourselves on this next one. hey, did you guys know… did you guys know that when a newborn baby… when a newborn baby is first born, when it’s fresh out of the womb… it can actually hear and see everything around it… for up to ten seconds after it’s decapitated? yeah. yeah. i never know what to say. i never know what to say to someone after they’ve lost a baby. what do you say to someone after they’ve lost a baby? “oh, i’m sorry for your loss”? doesn’t cut it. “are you gonna be okay?” not even close. that’s why i just keep my mouth shut. let my lawyer do the talking. i’m not good with kids. that’s my point. that’s what this whole thing’s about. i’m not good with kids. not gonna lie. hell, a couple of months ago, i dropped my cousin’s baby. flat-out dropped my cousin’s baby on the ground. but i don’t feel like that was my fault. i don’t feel responsible for that one, you know? who in their right mind… who the hell in their right mind would ever ask me, anthony jeselnik, to be a pallbearer? it’s okay, people hate… people hate dead baby jokes. they hate them. they hate them. it’s like, “anthony, why do you have to tell dead baby jokes? why do you have so many dead baby jokes?” “no one likes them, why do you insist?” well, i’ll tell you why. because dead baby jokes have made me rich. and who was it? who was it who said the first million is the hardest? was it hitler? didn’t see that one coming, did you? that was a good response. most audiences just pretend i didn’t say it. but i like it. i like making hitler jokes. it’s cool for me. i enjoy it. hell, i lost my grandfather. i lost my grandfather in the holocaust museum. it was the holocaust museum of modern art. which is just like a normal holocaust museum, except you walk around all day being like, “oh! i should have thought of that.” my grandmother died about a year ago. and i didn’t think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away. but i was wrong. it was fine. the hard part, the upsetting part… was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted. she wanted to die in the best way possible, like uh… you, radio winner. what’s the best way you can die? this is not a trick question. – in your sleep? – yes, thank you. thank you, everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep. not me. i want to be alert, awake, surrounded by friends, in a house fire. but my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep. we thought that’s how she went. we were all excited for her. but then we did an autopsy. found out she actually died horribly, in the worst way possible. during an autopsy. it was fucked up. yeah. yeah. she always said her grandkids didn’t pay enough attention to her and… and she was right. she was dead on. but i loved my grandma. loved her very much. my grandma taught me about a lot. taught me what religion is. taught me everything you can know about religion, in one quick story. i’ll tell you now. when i graduated from high school… when i graduated, my grandma came to me, gave me a big hug, said, “anthony, i’m so proud of you. you’re my first grandchild to get to go to college. what can i do for you, what can i give you before you go to college?” and i said, “honestly, grandma, all i need from you is money.” yeah, i know you guys have never been, but college is expensive. and my grandma said, “okay, anthony, i understand.” couple months go by. it’s the end of summer. i’m packing up my dad’s car, getting ready to go to school, and my grandma walks up. says, “anthony, here, before you leave, take this.” and she handed me a brand-new bible. king james version. and i said, “thanks, grandma, that’s exactly what we talked about.” i got in the car and i went off to school. couple of weeks go by, i’m hanging out in my dorm room, having a good time, when the phone rings. it’s my grandma. “anthony, just calling to see how college is going.” “grandma, college is the best. i’m having the time of my life. but to be honest, i’m starting to run low on money, and i could use a little bit, like we talked about.” she said, “okay, well let me ask you this: have you been reading your bible?” and i said, “totally, grandma, i’m on chapter four.” she said, “okay, anthony, i guess i’ll talk to you later.” hung up the phone. couple of months go by. now i’m really starting to struggle financially. might have to drop out of school, so i call my grandma in a panic. i say, “please, it’s anthony. i’m having the time of my life in college. but if i wanna graduate, and i do, i need you to send me some money like we talked about.” she said, “anthony, let me ask you this: have you been reading your bible?” and i said, “yes, grandma! i wish it was longer!” and she said, “okay, anthony. i guess i’ll talk to you later.” finally, it’s the end of the school year. i’ve got straight a’s, but i’m dropping out of college, ’cause i have no more money left. and i’m furious, close to tears, cleaning out my dorm room, when the phone rings. it’s my grandma. “anthony, i heard you’re dropping out of school today. how come?” and i said, “you know goddamn well how come, grandma! ‘cause you wouldn’t give me any money.” she said, “anthony, let me ask you this: did you read your bible?” and i just hung up the phone. i was so pissed off. took everything out of that room. last thing i took off the shelf, the last thing i took out of that room, was that bible my grandma had given me. took it off the shelf, held it in my hands, and for the first time, i actually opened it up. and on the very first page, in my grandmother’s handwriting, it said, “fuck you.” thank you everyone. i hope you enjoyed the jokes i prepared for you tonight. and all the jokes i write, they’re all made up, they’re all fake, except for eric clapton and the challenger. everything else… everything else is fake. but everything i’m about to tell you, from here until the end of the show, that’s all true. now… i don’t tell dark jokes because i’m a comedian. i’m a comedian because i tell dark jokes. i’m kind of fucked up, all right? i’ve always been this way. i can’t really help myself. it gets me into trouble a lot. i lose friends. it’s ruined relationships with people in my family. for instance, my grandmother actually did pass away, about six months ago. i did love her very much. she was a big fan of mine. and i was asked to speak at her funeral, which was a horrible mistake. horrible mistake. no one should ever ask me to speak at anyone’s funeral. i asked a friend for advice. was like, “i’ve never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money. how should i handle this?” “anthony, just go up there and tell a story. find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody. and don’t tell a joke. try not to.” so i walked up and was like, “you know what my favorite memory was? when i was like four years old, before i learned to read, grandma would curl up with me on the couch, she had this southern accent, and she would read to me. she would read mark twain to me, and i loved it. like… mark twain out of my grandma’s mouth, it would just come to life.” and then i couldn’t help myself. i said, “and i know my grandma loved it too, because it combined her two favorite things: spending time with her grandchildren, and using the ‘n’ word.” now i promise you… i promise you… until you’ve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wife’s funeral… …at a methodist church in vicksburg, mississippi… you are not a real comedian. i am a real comedian. i am a pure comedian. i think i’m one of the best comedians of all time. but here’s the thing. it doesn’t matter if you believe me. it really doesn’t matter. the important thing is that i would pass a lie detector test. i like to test myself. i like to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but. one of my favorite ways to test myself, i like to joke about tragedies the day that they happen. the day they happen. i don’t believe in too soon. i’m on a tight schedule. and i’m good at it. i’m good at it. like, the day of… the day of the aurora, colorado batman movie theater shooting. the day it happened, i went online, i went on twitter, and i tweeted “other than that, how was the movie?” right? right? nailed it. nailed it. and the reason i get away with that… the reason i get away with stuff like that is i’m just the guy who does it. people are used to it from me. it would be weird if i didn’t make a joke the day of a tragedy. which is why i was very surprised when i got in a lot of trouble the day of the boston marathon. now, i don’t follow the news regularly. but i know the second a tragedy happens because i get 25 text messages saying, “don’t do it.” and whenever i see that… whenever i see that, it makes me sad. it makes me sad ’cause i know something horrible has happened. people will say, “anthony, what’s funny about aurora? what’s funny about the boston marathon? what’s funny about your grandmother’s funeral?” nothing! nothing is funny about those things. that’s where i come in. so i see these texts and i’m like, “oh, no, what happened?” but i also think, “i’ve got a job to do.” so i go online, i start reading about it. i don’t want to watch the footage. but i’ll read about what happened. and i think, “how can i make someone laugh today?” and then i think, “i got it.” i go back on twitter. and i tweet, “guys, today, there are just some lines that should not be crossed.” “especially the finish line.” and again, i think, “nailed it. u.s.a.! u.s.a.!” but then my phone starts to ring. and it’s my boss. or should i say my former boss. and they say, “anthony, this is unacceptable. you are not just a comedian today. you’re also the host of your own tv show, with your name in the title, on our network. you take this joke down right now or you’re fired.” and i say, “go fuck yourselves.” and i meant it. i didn’t get into comedy for money or fame. i know that sounds wrong, because i’m dripping with both. i only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do. and they said… sure. they said, “well, anthony, you don’t understand. you don’t understand at all. if you don’t take this joke down right now, if you don’t delete this joke right now, not only are you fired, but the entire cast and crew of your television show, about a hundred people, they’re also out of a job.” and i’m ashamed to tell you this. i’m embarrassed to admit it. but in that moment, i folded, and i deleted the joke. ‘cause i’m happy to fight for what i believe in. i’m happy to take the consequences for what i’ve done. but what i could not do, cannot do, is walk up to my cameraman and say, “hey, buddy, no work for you on monday. i had this sweet tweet.” couldn’t do it. but as soon as i hit delete, i got mad and i regretted it. i would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now, i’ll tell ya that. and i got mad for betraying myself and everything i believe in. i’m just as mad today as i was then. just as mad. so mad, i had to have a meeting with the network, where they called me in for a little lecture. they’re like, “anthony, we’re family. why are you so upset? can’t you see we did you a favor? don’t you worry about your career?” let me ask you, san francisco, do i seem like i worry about my career? no. you know why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt? because if they’re worried about their money, they wouldn’t have played the lottery in the first fuckin’ place. i do not worry about my career. and they said, “anthony, the problem is when you make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy, it seems like you’re making fun of the victims, and that’s wrong.” but that’s not what i’m doing. because, you see, the day of a tragedy, victims are not on twitter. am i wrong? tell me i’m wrong. the day of a tragedy, victims have got victim shit to do. no one is ever… no one is ever putting on a tourniquet, asking, “hey, are we trending?” no. this is who i’m making fun of when i make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy. the people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet. and they run to their social media, facebook, twitter, whatever they got. and they all write down the exact same thing: “my thoughts and prayers…” “my thoughts and prayers with the people in aurora.” “my thoughts and prayers with the families in boston.” do you know what that’s worth? fucking nothing. fucking less than nothing. less than nothing. you are not giving any of your time, your money or even your compassion. all you are doing, all you are doing, is saying, “don’t forget about me today.” “don’t forget about me.” “lots of crazy distractions in the news, but don’t forget how sad i am.” those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of. they’re like a wedding photographer who only takes selfies. you understand? now i’m sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it. it’s fine. it’s embarrassing, but it’s fun. you can laugh at yourself. it’s not a reason to stop telling jokes. maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it. trust me, that’s fun too. you guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats? well, i guess that’s what makes me me. on my television show, i once did a segment that aired once and only once, before it was banned, called “shark party.” all right? now… some of you enjoyed it, but if you’ve never seen “shark party,” you can never see “shark party.” it’s been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be, so i will explain it to you. i love sharks. i love sharks more than anything. people… people i can barely fucking tolerate. every single year, 100 million sharks are killed by human beings. every year, 20, 25 people killed by sharks? so when i hear about a shark attack, i’m like, “fuck, yeah.” win one for the home team. so as soon as i get this show where i can do what i want, i say, “you know what? i want to have a shark party. as soon as there’s a shark attack, we’re having a shark party.” and i get lucky. about a month into my run, this guy from new zealand gets eaten by a great white, the champagne of sharks. and i know exactly what to do. i’ve already got the script written. i walk on stage, in front of the cameras. i say, “ladies and gentlemen, this guy from new zealand has been eaten by a great white shark. it’s time for a shark party.” lights go down, music comes up. six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me, and we all start dancing. for way too long. a stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance. very tasteful. and then i stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten. which, in retrospect, is where it all went wrong. but i get to say my favorite thing i’ve ever said on television: “smile, you son of a bitch. shark party.” and in america, where i’m famous for those types of shenanigans… everybody was like, “anthony, that was fucked up.” “it was fucked up to see you dance.” end of controversy. however, in new zealand, where they don’t get my show, they’ve never seen me, and frankly, they don’t get out much… the new zealand media takes the video… and they show it to the guy’s family. and they say, “what do you guys think about this?” and they say, “crikey,” or whatever the fuck they say over there. the point is, all of new zealand, all of new zealand rises up against me. all 45 of those cunts rise up. and start threatening my life. now, i don’t read the things that people write about me on the internet. but i pay people who do. and they come to me, and they’re like, “we’ve got some terrible news. please sit down.” they say, “you are getting a lot of death threats online from new zealand because of ‘shark party.'” and i was like, “really? new zealand wants to kill me? that’s weird because they didn’t even kill the shark.” i said, “how many death threats am i getting?” and they were like “oh, all of them. you are getting all of the death threats. what do you want us to do? we can send someone to talk to them. extra security? what do you want?” i said, “no, forget about it. leave it alone, don’t worry.” this might be hard for some to understand. i’ve said it several times tonight. everyone is going to die. i know full well i am going to die. and most of us don’t get to choose how we check out. but if i die because someone murders me over one of my jokes? best case scenario. if somebody murders me over one of my jokes, i immediately become a legend. i’m a comedy god. the mount rushmore of comedy is me, four times. i said, “come on then.” my security guys are like, “okay, anthony, well, just so you know, that is the dumbest thing we’ve ever heard.” “but you’re the boss. okay.” and they leave. and then the next day they come back. and they say “anthony, sorry to bother you again. i know you didn’t care yesterday, but it’s gotten much worse. you’re gonna wanna hear this.” they say, “someone from new zealand tracked down your mom and dad’s phone number and address in pittsburgh, posted that online… and now your entire family is getting death threats from new zealand.” and i have to admit, that had never occurred to me before. it never crossed my mind… that my family, my loved ones, would ever pay the price, be caught in harm’s way, for something i’ve done or i’ve joked about. and honestly, i would cut my throat for my jokes. i would give my life for what i do. but if anyone, and i mean this for a fact, if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone i cared about because of a joke i’ve made? even better. this man is fantastic\n",
            "i watched the show 10 times  and i laughed so much everytime except for the eric clapton joke and sharky party all is forgivable.  great material. so a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is okay but a joke about a famous musician’s son falling to his death isn’t?  where are your priorities? they’re just jokes.  it’s just syllables formed together.  they’re just words. people are monsters, these are just words your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * \n",

but she just got a tattoo of a butterfly over her chest which is horrible doesn’t she understand how dumb that’s gonna look some day all stretched out over my lamp yeah that’s a joke that’s a joke where i’m a serial killer i’m very open about it don’t you dare tighten up on me i hate sensitivity i hate it even when little kids get sensitive that makes me mad i got a sixyearold nephew i asked what he wants for his birthday he said “uncle anthony i want you to get me a barbie doll” i said “fuck you” “you sixyearold piece of shit” and don’t get me wrong don’t get me wrong i don’t care if he plays with dolls he can wear dresses if he wants to but i’m not getting him a barbie doll you see barbie dolls give little boys unrealistic expectations… …of how easy it’s gonna be to tear off a head i won’t do it i get really mad when people get sensitive about comedy if you’re sensitive about comedy it’s the dumbest thing you can do i call them the joke police they always have one rule one rule they have you can’t make fun of this right now after a couple years they move on to something else which is why it’s so hypocritical like the thing today the thing right now you can’t make fun of the thing that’s too sensitive at this moment transgendered people see you can’t do it can’t make fun of them it’s too sensitive in fact you can’t even call them “chicks with dicks” anymore no no you have to call them “men who talk too much” right but i hear this all the time people’ll be like “anthony that was really funny but man women must hate you women must come to your shows and hate the shit out of you” and i always say “no no stupid women hate my shows” “stupid women hate my shows smart women… don’t come to my shows” speaking of which what’s your name – what kim – kim – kim where you from –

the liquor cabinet… to try to spend time with them i like san francisco so liberal so liberal clap your hands here clap your hands if you own a gun san jose is in the house huh not too bad i once asked the crowd in houston that question they just started firing guns in the air didn’t even let me finish the question i don’t own a gun i’m against guns to be honest when i was a kid… when i was a kid my parents had a gun my parents said we had to have a gun gotta have a gun to protect the five children gotta have a gun to protect our five children of course they eventually got rid of it… to protect their four children i’m not gonna lie it was fun while it lasted i was getting pretty good towards the end man my parents were strict mom and dad were strict my mom and dad once made me smoke an entire pack of cigarettes an entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty i learned a lot from my parents especially my dad like i’ll never forget… the first time i ever got a bad report card in school first time i got a bad report card i brought it home i gave it to my dad and my dad beat me beat the hell out of me but i learned something because the next time i got a bad report card in school i brought it home and i gave it to my mom let her take the hit yeah\n",
            "my dad was a hardass one of those guys who believed that men just learn by doing things you know you don’t take classes you don’t read the instructions you just do it and figure it out like when i was a kid i never got to take swimming lessons no my dad would pick me up and throw me in the water to teach himself cpr\n",
            "as a kid my dad’s prized possession my dad’s favorite thing in the world growing up my dad was the proud owner of a mickey mantle rookie card mickey mantle rookie baseball card mint condition kept it between two little pieces of plastic but i was a kid i didn’t know any better one day i took that card to school and i traded it to a classmate for a candy bar you know what that card is worth today my relationship with my father\n",
            "i mean it my dad was no joke my dad did not fuck around my dad did not trust anybody my dad did not trust anyone in fact he had a saying… but he wouldn’t tell me what too clever for you that joke is fuckin’ amazing last year was a sad year for my family last year my mom should’ve been celebrating her 60th birthday but because of drugs alcohol and other terrible decisions we all forgot it was sad\n",
            "when i was a kid i used to fantasize about getting older growing up and having money and buying my mom nice things for her birthday when i was a kid we were poor so poor i remember just so i could go to my senior prom just so i could go to my senior prom i had to sell my us passport on the street sold my passport on the street for 300 bucks to get to go to my prom of course this was before 911 so… my bad everybody weird joke to clap for but sure my mom actually should’ve been on one of the planes that crashed on 911 i think\n",
            "i mean don’t get me wrong i loved my mother she was my mom of course i loved her we fought a lot my mom could be very racist very racist and i do not tolerate racism that’s ignorance and i hate that when i was a kid like nine years old i’d come home after school once in a while i’d bring a friend over to play with me at my house once in a while i’d bring a black friend over and when i did that my mom would act weird she’d pull me aside and say “anthony who’s your new friend is he a drug dealer” and i would say “shut up mom that’s racist put your money away” i never get to see my family anymore really most of them are in jail to be honest and we never talk write letters or any of that shit ‘cause they’re all in jail for the exact same thing my testimony you – what’s your name – melissa – melissa where you from – santa clara – what do you do – i win things on the radio – you win things on the radio – yeah followup question how’d you get tickets to this let me ask you this you ever uh… you ever find a body in the woods ever do that no it’s okay i have i was walking through the woods one day and… some poor bastard had stepped in a bear trap or something i never told anybody about it but i went back there a week later and he was dead yeah i do crazy shit like that all the time what can i say i’m wacky the other night i was driving my car i was driving my car and i ran over a deer… a dear dear friend i’m torn constantly at night i do shows but during the day i’ve got a hobby during the day i go from town to town… and i shut down the local abortion clinic you heard me i shut down abortion clinics everywhere i go it’s easy for me i’m charming i stand outside the front doors all day long and… consistently underbid them you guys mad about that one it’s gonna get so much fuckin’ worse gotta talk to one more person you sir what’s your name – allan – allan where you from – frisco – frisco i can tell you’re a local ’cause of how cool you are what do you do frisco – i fight fires i fight fires – you what you’re a firefighter awesome what do you wanna do if you could do anything if you could do any job in the world what would your dream job be – travel the world – travel the world it’s good to have a dream i hope you go for it it doesn’t sound like you’re even gonna get close i think you should do it travel the world do it\n",
            "everyone should try to live their dream that’s my point everyone i get to live my dream i mean not when i’m in san francisco but for the most part being a comedian was my dream ‘cause no one can tell me what to do that’s all i cared about most people don’t ever try to live their dream lot of people try and they fail which i think is better more noble more respectable\n",
            "i had an uncle all he ever dreamed about cared about talked about… wanted to become an astronaut fly into space one day and he went for it he went for it and he failed he blew it ended up becoming one of those pussies… …on the space shuttle challenger you guys remember that right i think it’s funny i think it’s funny how the things that happen to us when we’re kids end up staying with us for our entire lives i got this little niece when she was three years old she almost drowned and now to this day even ten years later she still will not go anywhere near me yeah i was babysitting her… and trying to do laundry and she accidentally fell into the washing machine thought i was quick i got good reflexes i thought i got her out before anyone would find out what happened but nope turned everything pink you’re gonna find out a lot about yourselves on this next one hey did you guys know… did you guys know that when a newborn baby… when a newborn baby is first born when it’s fresh out of the womb… it can actually hear and see everything around it… for up to ten seconds after it’s decapitated yeah yeah i never know what to say i never know what to say to someone after they’ve lost a baby what do you say to someone after they’ve lost a baby “oh i’m sorry for your loss” doesn’t cut it “are you gonna be okay” not even close that’s why i just keep my mouth shut let my lawyer do the talking i’m not good with kids that’s my point that’s what this whole thing’s about i’m not good with kids not gonna lie hell a couple of months ago i dropped my cousin’s baby flatout dropped my cousin’s baby on the ground but i don’t feel like that was my fault i don’t feel responsible for that one you know who in their right mind… who the hell in their right mind would ever ask me anthony jeselnik to be a pallbearer it’s okay people hate… people hate dead baby jokes they hate them they hate them it’s like “anthony why do you have to tell dead baby jokes why do you have so many dead baby jokes” “no one likes them why do you insist” well i’ll tell you why because dead baby jokes have made me rich and who was it who was it who said the first million is the hardest was it hitler didn’t see that one coming did you that was a good response most audiences just pretend i didn’t say it but i like it i like making hitler jokes it’s cool for me i enjoy it hell i lost my grandfather i lost my grandfather in the holocaust museum it was the holocaust museum of modern art which is just like a normal holocaust museum except you walk around all day being like “oh i should have thought of that” my grandmother died about a year ago and i didn’t think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away but i was wrong it was fine the hard part the upsetting part… was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted she wanted to die in the best way possible like uh… you radio winner what’s the best way you can die this is not a trick question – in your sleep – yes thank you thank you everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep not me i want to be alert awake surrounded by friends in a house fire but my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep we thought that’s how she went we were all excited for her but then we did an autopsy found out she actually died horribly in the worst way possible during an autopsy it was fucked up yeah yeah she always said her grandkids didn’t pay enough attention to her and… and she was right she was dead on but i loved my grandma loved her very much my grandma taught me about a lot taught me what religion is taught me everything you can know about religion in one quick story i’ll tell you now when i graduated from high school… when i graduated my grandma came to me gave me a big hug said “anthony i’m so proud of you you’re my first grandchild to get to go to college what can i do for you what can i give you before you go to college” and i said “honestly grandma all i need from you is money” yeah i know you guys have never been but college is expensive and my grandma said “okay anthony i understand” couple months go by it’s the end of summer i’m packing up my dad’s car getting ready to go to school and my grandma walks up says “anthony here before you leave take this” and she handed me a brandnew bible king james version and i said “thanks grandma that’s exactly what we talked about” i got in the car and i went off to school couple of weeks go by i’m hanging out in my dorm room having a good time when the phone rings it’s my grandma “anthony just calling to see how college is going” “grandma college is the best i’m having the time of my life but to be honest i’m starting to run low on money and i could use a little bit like we talked about” she said “okay well let me ask you this have you been reading your bible” and i said “totally grandma i’m on chapter four” she said “okay anthony i guess i’ll talk to you later” hung up the phone couple of months go by now i’m really starting to struggle financially might have to drop out of school so i call my grandma in a panic i say “please it’s anthony i’m having the time of my life in college but if i wanna graduate and i do i need you to send me some money like we talked about” she said “anthony let me ask you this have you been reading your bible” and i said “yes grandma i wish it was longer” and she said “okay anthony i guess i’ll talk to you later” finally it’s the end of the school year i’ve got straight a’s but i’m dropping out of college ’cause i have no more money left and i’m furious close to tears cleaning out my dorm room when the phone rings it’s my grandma “anthony i heard you’re dropping out of school today how come” and i said “you know goddamn well how come grandma ‘cause you wouldn’t give me any money” she said “anthony let me ask you this did you read your bible” and i just hung up the phone i was so pissed off took everything out of that room last thing i took off the shelf the last thing i took out of that room was that bible my grandma had given me took it off the shelf held it in my hands and for the first time i actually opened it up and on the very first page in my grandmother’s handwriting it said “fuck you” thank you everyone i hope you enjoyed the jokes i prepared for you tonight and all the jokes i write they’re all made up they’re all fake except for eric clapton and the challenger everything else… everything else is fake but everything i’m about to tell you from here until the end of the show that’s all true now… i don’t tell dark jokes because i’m a comedian i’m a comedian because i tell dark jokes i’m kind of fucked up all right i’ve always been this way i can’t really help myself it gets me into trouble a lot i lose friends it’s ruined relationships with people in my family for instance my grandmother actually did pass away about six months ago i did love her very much she was a big fan of mine and i was asked to speak at her funeral which was a horrible mistake horrible mistake no one should ever ask me to speak at anyone’s funeral i asked a friend for advice was like “i’ve never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money how should i handle this” “anthony just go up there and tell a story find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody and don’t tell a joke try not to” so i walked up and was like “you know what my favorite memory was when i was like four years old before i learned to read grandma would curl up with me on the couch she had this southern accent and she would read to me she would read mark twain to me and i loved it like… mark twain out of my grandma’s mouth it would just come to life” and then i couldn’t help myself i said “and i know my grandma loved it too because it combined her two favorite things spending time with her grandchildren and using the ‘n’ word” now i promise you… i promise you… until you’ve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wife’s funeral… …at a methodist church in vicksburg mississippi… you are not a real comedian i am a real comedian i am a pure comedian i think i’m one of the best comedians of all time but here’s the thing it doesn’t matter if you believe me it really doesn’t matter the important thing is that i would pass a lie detector test i like to test myself i like to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but one of my favorite ways to test myself i like to joke about tragedies the day that they happen the day they happen i don’t believe in too soon i’m on a tight schedule and i’m good at it i’m good at it like the day of… the day of the aurora colorado batman movie theater shooting the day it happened i went online i went on twitter and i tweeted “other than that how was the movie” right right nailed it nailed it and the reason i get away with that… the reason i get away with stuff like that is i’m just the guy who does it people are used to it from me it would be weird if i didn’t make a joke the day of a tragedy which is why i was very surprised when i got in a lot of trouble the day of the boston marathon now i don’t follow the news regularly but i know the second a tragedy happens because i get 25 text messages saying “don’t do it” and whenever i see that… whenever i see that it makes me sad it makes me sad ’cause i know something horrible has happened people will say “anthony what’s funny about aurora what’s funny about the boston marathon what’s funny about your grandmother’s funeral” nothing nothing is funny about those things that’s where i come in so i see these texts and i’m like “oh no what happened” but i also think “i’ve got a job to do” so i go online i start reading about it i don’t want to watch the footage but i’ll read about what happened and i think “how can i make someone laugh today” and then i think “i got it” i go back on twitter and i tweet “guys today there are just some lines that should not be crossed” “especially the finish line” and again i think “nailed it usa usa” but then my phone starts to ring and it’s my boss or should i say my former boss and they say “anthony this is unacceptable you are not just a comedian today you’re also the host of your own tv show with your name in the title on our network you take this joke down right now or you’re fired” and i say “go fuck yourselves” and i meant it i didn’t get into comedy for money or fame i know that sounds wrong because i’m dripping with both i only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do and they said… sure they said “well anthony you don’t understand you don’t understand at all if you don’t take this joke down right now if you don’t delete this joke right now not only are you fired but the entire cast and crew of your television show about a hundred people they’re also out of a job” and i’m ashamed to tell you this i’m embarrassed to admit it but in that moment i folded and i deleted the joke ‘cause i’m happy to fight for what i believe in i’m happy to take the consequences for what i’ve done but what i could not do cannot do is walk up to my cameraman and say “hey buddy no work for you on monday i had this sweet tweet” couldn’t do it but as soon as i hit delete i got mad and i regretted it i would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now i’ll tell ya that and i got mad for betraying myself and everything i believe in i’m just as mad today as i was then just as mad so mad i had to have a meeting with the network where they called me in for a little lecture they’re like “anthony we’re family why are you so upset can’t you see we did you a favor don’t you worry about your career” let me ask you san francisco do i seem like i worry about my career no you know why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt because if they’re worried about their money they wouldn’t have played the lottery in the first fuckin’ place i do not worry about my career and they said “anthony the problem is when you make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy it seems like you’re making fun of the victims and that’s wrong” but that’s not what i’m doing because you see the day of a tragedy victims are not on twitter am i wrong tell me i’m wrong the day of a tragedy victims have got victim shit to do no one is ever… no one is ever putting on a tourniquet asking “hey are we trending” no this is who i’m making fun of when i make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy the people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet and they run to their social media facebook twitter whatever they got and they all write down the exact same thing “my thoughts and prayers…” “my thoughts and prayers with the people in aurora” “my thoughts and prayers with the families in boston” do you know what that’s worth fucking nothing fucking less than nothing less than nothing you are not giving any of your time your money or even your compassion all you are doing all you are doing is saying “don’t forget about me today” “don’t forget about me” “lots of crazy distractions in the news but don’t forget how sad i am” those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of they’re like a wedding photographer who only takes selfies you understand now i’m sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it it’s fine it’s embarrassing but it’s fun you can laugh at yourself it’s not a reason to stop telling jokes maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it trust me that’s fun too you guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats well i guess that’s what makes me me on my television show i once did a segment that aired once and only once before it was banned called “shark party” all right now… some of you enjoyed it but if you’ve never seen “shark party” you can never see “shark party” it’s been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be so i will explain it to you i love sharks i love sharks more than anything people… people i can barely fucking tolerate every single year 100 million sharks are killed by human beings every year 20 25 people killed by sharks so when i hear about a shark attack i’m like “fuck yeah” win one for the home team so as soon as i get this show where i can do what i want i say “you know what i want to have a shark party as soon as there’s a shark attack we’re having a shark party” and i get lucky about a month into my run this guy from new zealand gets eaten by a great white the champagne of sharks and i know exactly what to do i’ve already got the script written i walk on stage in front of the cameras i say “ladies and gentlemen this guy from new zealand has been eaten by a great white shark it’s time for a shark party” lights go down music comes up six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me and we all start dancing for way too long a stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance very tasteful and then i stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten which in retrospect is where it all went wrong but i get to say my favorite thing i’ve ever said on television “smile you son of a bitch shark party” and in america where i’m famous for those types of shenanigans… everybody was like “anthony that was fucked up” “it was fucked up to see you dance” end of controversy however in new zealand where they don’t get my show they’ve never seen me and frankly they don’t get out much… the new zealand media takes the video… and they show it to the guy’s family and they say “what do you guys think about this” and they say “crikey” or whatever the fuck they say over there the point is all of new zealand all of new zealand rises up against me all 45 of those cunts rise up and start threatening my life now i don’t read the things that people write about me on the internet but i pay people who do and they come to me and they’re like “we’ve got some terrible news please sit down” they say “you are getting a lot of death threats online from new zealand because of ‘shark party” and i was like “really new zealand wants to kill me that’s weird because they didn’t even kill the shark” i said “how many death threats am i getting” and they were like “oh all of them you are getting all of the death threats what do you want us to do we can send someone to talk to them extra security what do you want” i said “no forget about it leave it alone don’t worry” this might be hard for some to understand i’ve said it several times tonight everyone is going to die i know full well i am going to die and most of us don’t get to choose how we check out but if i die because someone murders me over one of my jokes best case scenario if somebody murders me over one of my jokes i immediately become a legend i’m a comedy god the mount rushmore of comedy is me four times i said “come on then” my security guys are like “okay anthony well just so you know that is the dumbest thing we’ve ever heard” “but you’re the boss okay” and they leave and then the next day they come back and they say “anthony sorry to bother you again i know you didn’t care yesterday but it’s gotten much worse you’re gonna wanna hear this” they say “someone from new zealand tracked down your mom and dad’s phone number and address in pittsburgh posted that online… and now your entire family is getting death threats from new zealand” and i have to admit that had never occurred to me before it never crossed my mind… that my family my loved ones would ever pay the price be caught in harm’s way for something i’ve done or i’ve joked about and honestly i would cut my throat for my jokes i would give my life for what i do but if anyone and i mean this for a fact if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone i cared about because of a joke i’ve made even better this man is fantastic\n",
            "i watched the show 10 times  and i laughed so much everytime except for the eric clapton joke and sharky party all is forgivable  great material so a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is okay but a joke about a famous musician’s son falling to his death isn’t  where are your priorities they’re just jokes  it’s just syllables formed together  they’re just words people are monsters these are just words your email address will not be published required fields are marked  \n",

awful my brother is crazy even my neighbors hate him the other day i opened the door i caught him masturbating he looks me right in the eyes and goes “shut the door” i said “get inside” my family loves it when i put them in jokes they love it “anthony please put me in your next joke” “are you sure i’m gonna make you a pedophile” “we don’t care we wanna be part of this thing you’ve got going on” so i wrote that joke put my brother in i’m in chicago where he lives after the show he comes backstage and i say “mikey what’d you think about that new joke did you like the shout out” and he gets all uncomfortable he goes “well crowd seemed to think it was funny… but i think it’s kinda weird that you got a joke where you wanna fuck me” and i said “what mikey no no mikey you’re my brother that’s a joke about you masturbating in front of my house” and he goes “yeah and then you’re like ‘get back inside” just in case you guys are wondering whether my brother’s a fuckin’ idiot yeah i’ve got a nice place try to keep it nice not always successful like i tried getting a puppy disaster had to get rid of that puppy had to get rid of that puppy almost immediately the first time i left it home alone the first time i left that puppy home alone that damn thing tore my entire place apart shit everywhere and starved to death why are you mad i’m the one who couldn’t get his money back and this is traditionally where crowds really start to turn on me after i kill a puppy with neglect and it’s okay it’s okay you can get mad at me you can hate me you can hate me and still laugh at me that’s how talented i am and i’m used to it i’m used to it i once dated a girl who punched me in the face as hard as she could once dated a girl punched me right in the face as hard as she could i didn’t do anything about it i didn’t say anything about it i just turned around and left the room but in my head in my head all i was thinking was… “now we’re even” she was so mad she got mad at me she got mad at me ’cause i killed all of her plants killed every single one of her house plants and she had told me she said “anthony i’m going out of town for two weeks give each one of these half a cup of water every other day” but i’m a dude all i heard was “two weeks” and “cheat on me” like my neighbors in la… my neighbors in la have got this smokin’ hot  daughter i mean she’s perfect but she just got a tattoo of a butterfly over her chest which is horrible doesn’t she understand how dumb that’s gonna look some day all stretched out over my lamp yeah that’s a joke that’s a joke where i’m a serial killer i’m very open about it don’t you dare tighten up on me i hate sensitivity i hate it even when little kids get sensitive that makes me mad i got a sixyearold nephew i asked what he wants for his birthday he said “uncle anthony i want you to get me a barbie doll” i said “fuck you” “you sixyearold piece of shit” and don’t get me wrong don’t get me wrong i don’t care if he plays with dolls he can wear dresses if he wants to but i’m not getting him a barbie doll you see barbie dolls give little boys unrealistic expectations… …of how easy it’s gonna be to tear off a head i won’t do it i get really mad when people get sensitive about comedy if you’re sensitive about comedy it’s the dumbest thing you can do i call them the joke police they always have one rule one rule they have you can’t make fun of this right now after a couple years they move on to something else which is why it’s so hypocritical like the thing today the thing right now you can’t make fun of the thing that’s too sensitive at this moment transgendered people see you can’t do it can’t make fun of them it’s too sensitive in fact you can’t even call them “chicks with dicks” anymore no no you have to call them “men who talk too much” right but i hear this all the time people’ll be like “anthony that was really funny but man women must hate you women must come to your shows and hate the shit out of you” and i always say “no no stupid women hate my shows” “stupid women hate my shows smart women… don’t come to my shows” speaking of which what’s your name – what kim – kim – kim where you from – san

asked the crowd in houston that question they just started firing guns in the air didn’t even let me finish the question i don’t own a gun i’m against guns to be honest when i was a kid… when i was a kid my parents had a gun my parents said we had to have a gun gotta have a gun to protect the five children gotta have a gun to protect our five children of course they eventually got rid of it… to protect their four children i’m not gonna lie it was fun while it lasted i was getting pretty good towards the end man my parents were strict mom and dad were strict my mom and dad once made me smoke an entire pack of cigarettes an entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty i learned a lot from my parents especially my dad like i’ll never forget… the first time i ever got a bad report card in school first time i got a bad report card i brought it home i gave it to my dad and my dad beat me beat the hell out of me but i learned something because the next time i got a bad report card in school i brought it home and i gave it to my mom let her take the hit yeah\n",
            "my dad was a hardass one of those guys who believed that men just learn by doing things you know you don’t take classes you don’t read the instructions you just do it and figure it out like when i was a kid i never got to take swimming lessons no my dad would pick me up and throw me in the water to teach himself cpr\n",
            "as a kid my dad’s prized possession my dad’s favorite thing in the world growing up my dad was the proud owner of a mickey mantle rookie card mickey mantle rookie baseball card mint condition kept it between two little pieces of plastic but i was a kid i didn’t know any better one day i took that card to school and i traded it to a classmate for a candy bar you know what that card is worth today my relationship with my father\n",

            "i mean don’t get me wrong i loved my mother she was my mom of course i loved her we fought a lot my mom could be very racist very racist and i do not tolerate racism that’s ignorance and i hate that when i was a kid like nine years old i’d come home after school once in a while i’d bring a friend over to play with me at my house once in a while i’d bring a black friend over and when i did that my mom would act weird she’d pull me aside and say “anthony who’s your new friend is he a drug dealer” and i would say “shut up mom that’s racist put your money away” i never get to see my family anymore really most of them are in jail to be honest and we never talk write letters or any of that shit ‘cause they’re all in jail for the exact same thing my testimony you – what’s your name – melissa – melissa where you from – santa clara – what do you do – i win things on the radio – you win things on the radio – yeah followup question how’d you get tickets to this let me ask you this you ever uh… you ever find a body in the woods ever do that no it’s okay i have i was walking through the woods one day and… some poor bastard had stepped in a bear trap or something i never told anybody about it but i went back there a week later and he was dead yeah i do crazy shit like that all the time what can i say i’m wacky the other night i was driving my car i was driving my car and i ran over a deer… a dear dear friend i’m torn constantly at night i do shows but during the day i’ve got a hobby during the day i go from town to town… and i shut down the local abortion clinic you heard me i shut down abortion clinics everywhere i go it’s easy for me i’m charming i stand outside the front doors all day long and… consistently underbid them you guys mad about that one it’s gonna get so much fuckin’ worse gotta talk to one more person you sir what’s your name – allan – allan where you from – frisco – frisco i can tell you’re a local ’cause of how cool you are what do you do frisco – i fight fires i fight fires – you what you’re a firefighter awesome what do you wanna do if you could do anything if you could do any job in the world what would your dream job be – travel the world – travel the world it’s good to have a dream i hope you go for it it doesn’t sound like you’re even gonna get close i think you should do it travel the world do it\n",
            "everyone should try to live their dream that’s my point everyone i get to live my dream i mean not when i’m in san francisco but for the most part being a comedian was my dream ‘cause no one can tell me what to do that’s all i cared about most people don’t ever try to live their dream lot of people try and they fail which i think is better more noble more respectable\n",
            "i had an uncle all he ever dreamed about cared about talked about… wanted to become an astronaut fly into space one day and he went for it he went for it and he failed he blew it ended up becoming one of those pussies… …on the space shuttle challenger you guys remember that right i think it’s funny i think it’s funny how the things that happen to us when we’re kids end up staying with us for our entire lives i got this little niece when she was three years old she almost drowned and now to this day even ten years later she still will not go anywhere near me yeah i was babysitting her… and trying to do laundry and she accidentally fell into the washing machine thought i was quick i got good reflexes i thought i got her out before anyone would find out what happened but nope turned everything pink you’re gonna find out a lot about yourselves on this next one hey did you guys know… did you guys know that when a newborn baby… when a newborn baby is first born when it’s fresh out of the womb… it can actually hear and see everything around it… for up to ten seconds after it’s decapitated yeah yeah i never know what to say i never know what to say to someone after they’ve lost a baby what do you say to someone after they’ve lost a baby “oh i’m sorry for your loss” doesn’t cut it “are you gonna be okay” not even close that’s why i just keep my mouth shut let my lawyer do the talking i’m not good with kids that’s my point that’s what this whole thing’s about i’m not good with kids not gonna lie hell a couple of months ago i dropped my cousin’s baby flatout dropped my cousin’s baby on the ground but i don’t feel like that was my fault i don’t feel responsible for that one you know who in their right mind… who the hell in their right mind would ever ask me anthony jeselnik to be a pallbearer it’s okay people hate… people hate dead baby jokes they hate them they hate them it’s like “anthony why do you have to tell dead baby jokes why do you have so many dead baby jokes” “no one likes them why do you insist” well i’ll tell you why because dead baby jokes have made me rich and who was it who was it who said the first million is the hardest was it hitler didn’t see that one coming did you that was a good response most audiences just pretend i didn’t say it but i like it i like making hitler jokes it’s cool for me i enjoy it hell i lost my grandfather i lost my grandfather in the holocaust museum it was the holocaust museum of modern art which is just like a normal holocaust museum except you walk around all day being like “oh i should have thought of that” my grandmother died about a year ago and i didn’t think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away but i was wrong it was fine the hard part the upsetting part… was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted she wanted to die in the best way possible like uh… you radio winner what’s the best way you can die this is not a trick question – in your sleep – yes thank you thank you everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep not me i want to be alert awake surrounded by friends in a house fire but my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep we thought that’s how she went we were all excited for her but then we did an autopsy found out she actually died horribly in the worst way possible during an autopsy it was fucked up yeah yeah she always said her grandkids didn’t pay enough attention to her and… and she was right she was dead on but i loved my grandma loved her very much my grandma taught me about a lot taught me what religion is taught me everything you can know about religion in one quick story i’ll tell you now when i graduated from high school… when i graduated my grandma came to me gave me a big hug said “anthony i’m so proud of you you’re my first grandchild to get to go to college what can i do for you what can i give you before you go to college” and i said “honestly grandma all i need from you is money” yeah i know you guys have never been but college is expensive and my grandma said “okay anthony i understand” couple months go by it’s the end of summer i’m packing up my dad’s car getting ready to go to school and my grandma walks up says “anthony here before you leave take this” and she handed me a brandnew bible king james version and i said “thanks grandma that’s exactly what we talked about” i got in the car and i went off to school couple of weeks go by i’m hanging out in my dorm room having a good time when the phone rings it’s my grandma “anthony just calling to see how college is going” “grandma college is the best i’m having the time of my life but to be honest i’m starting to run low on money and i could use a little bit like we talked about” she said “okay well let me ask you this have you been reading your bible” and i said “totally grandma i’m on chapter four” she said “okay anthony i guess i’ll talk to you later” hung up the phone couple of months go by now i’m really starting to struggle financially might have to drop out of school so i call my grandma in a panic i say “please it’s anthony i’m having the time of my life in college but if i wanna graduate and i do i need you to send me some money like we talked about” she said “anthony let me ask you this have you been reading your bible” and i said “yes grandma i wish it was longer” and she said “okay anthony i guess i’ll talk to you later” finally it’s the end of the school year i’ve got straight a’s but i’m dropping out of college ’cause i have no more money left and i’m furious close to tears cleaning out my dorm room when the phone rings it’s my grandma “anthony i heard you’re dropping out of school today how come” and i said “you know goddamn well how come grandma ‘cause you wouldn’t give me any money” she said “anthony let me ask you this did you read your bible” and i just hung up the phone i was so pissed off took everything out of that room last thing i took off the shelf the last thing i took out of that room was that bible my grandma had given me took it off the shelf held it in my hands and for the first time i actually opened it up and on the very first page in my grandmother’s handwriting it said “fuck you” thank you everyone i hope you enjoyed the jokes i prepared for you tonight and all the jokes i write they’re all made up they’re all fake except for eric clapton and the challenger everything else… everything else is fake but everything i’m about to tell you from here until the end of the show that’s all true now… i don’t tell dark jokes because i’m a comedian i’m a comedian because i tell dark jokes i’m kind of fucked up all right i’ve always been this way i can’t really help myself it gets me into trouble a lot i lose friends it’s ruined relationships with people in my family for instance my grandmother actually did pass away about six months ago i did love her very much she was a big fan of mine and i was asked to speak at her funeral which was a horrible mistake horrible mistake no one should ever ask me to speak at anyone’s funeral i asked a friend for advice was like “i’ve never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money how should i handle this” “anthony just go up there and tell a story find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody and don’t tell a joke try not to” so i walked up and was like “you know what my favorite memory was when i was like four years old before i learned to read grandma would curl up with me on the couch she had this southern accent and she would read to me she would read mark twain to me and i loved it like… mark twain out of my grandma’s mouth it would just come to life” and then i couldn’t help myself i said “and i know my grandma loved it too because it combined her two favorite things spending time with her grandchildren and using the ‘n’ word” now i promise you… i promise you… until you’ve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wife’s funeral… …at a methodist church in vicksburg mississippi… you are not a real comedian i am a real comedian i am a pure comedian i think i’m one of the best comedians of all time but here’s the thing it doesn’t matter if you believe me it really doesn’t matter the important thing is that i would pass a lie detector test i like to test myself i like to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but one of my favorite ways to test myself i like to joke about tragedies the day that they happen the day they happen i don’t believe in too soon i’m on a tight schedule and i’m good at it i’m good at it like the day of… the day of the aurora colorado batman movie theater shooting the day it happened i went online i went on twitter and i tweeted “other than that how was the movie” right right nailed it nailed it and the reason i get away with that… the reason i get away with stuff like that is i’m just the guy who does it people are used to it from me it would be weird if i didn’t make a joke the day of a tragedy which is why i was very surprised when i got in a lot of trouble the day of the boston marathon now i don’t follow the news regularly but i know the second a tragedy happens because i get  text messages saying “don’t do it” and whenever i see that… whenever i see that it makes me sad it makes me sad ’cause i know something horrible has happened people will say “anthony what’s funny about aurora what’s funny about the boston marathon what’s funny about your grandmother’s funeral” nothing nothing is funny about those things that’s where i come in so i see these texts and i’m like “oh no what happened” but i also think “i’ve got a job to do” so i go online i start reading about it i don’t want to watch the footage but i’ll read about what happened and i think “how can i make someone laugh today” and then i think “i got it” i go back on twitter and i tweet “guys today there are just some lines that should not be crossed” “especially the finish line” and again i think “nailed it usa usa” but then my phone starts to ring and it’s my boss or should i say my former boss and they say “anthony this is unacceptable you are not just a comedian today you’re also the host of your own tv show with your name in the title on our network you take this joke down right now or you’re fired” and i say “go fuck yourselves” and i meant it i didn’t get into comedy for money or fame i know that sounds wrong because i’m dripping with both i only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do and they said… sure they said “well anthony you don’t understand you don’t understand at all if you don’t take this joke down right now if you don’t delete this joke right now not only are you fired but the entire cast and crew of your television show about a hundred people they’re also out of a job” and i’m ashamed to tell you this i’m embarrassed to admit it but in that moment i folded and i deleted the joke ‘cause i’m happy to fight for what i believe in i’m happy to take the consequences for what i’ve done but what i could not do cannot do is walk up to my cameraman and say “hey buddy no work for you on monday i had this sweet tweet” couldn’t do it but as soon as i hit delete i got mad and i regretted it i would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now i’ll tell ya that and i got mad for betraying myself and everything i believe in i’m just as mad today as i was then just as mad so mad i had to have a meeting with the network where they called me in for a little lecture they’re like “anthony we’re family why are you so upset can’t you see we did you a favor don’t you worry about your career” let me ask you san francisco do i seem like i worry about my career no you know why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt because if they’re worried about their money they wouldn’t have played the lottery in the first fuckin’ place i do not worry about my career and they said “anthony the problem is when you make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy it seems like you’re making fun of the victims and that’s wrong” but that’s not what i’m doing because you see the day of a tragedy victims are not on twitter am i wrong tell me i’m wrong the day of a tragedy victims have got victim shit to do no one is ever… no one is ever putting on a tourniquet asking “hey are we trending” no this is who i’m making fun of when i make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy the people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet and they run to their social media facebook twitter whatever they got and they all write down the exact same thing “my thoughts and prayers…” “my thoughts and prayers with the people in aurora” “my thoughts and prayers with the families in boston” do you know what that’s worth fucking nothing fucking less than nothing less than nothing you are not giving any of your time your money or even your compassion all you are doing all you are doing is saying “don’t forget about me today” “don’t forget about me” “lots of crazy distractions in the news but don’t forget how sad i am” those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of they’re like a wedding photographer who only takes selfies you understand now i’m sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it it’s fine it’s embarrassing but it’s fun you can laugh at yourself it’s not a reason to stop telling jokes maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it trust me that’s fun too you guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats well i guess that’s what makes me me on my television show i once did a segment that aired once and only once before it was banned called “shark party” all right now… some of you enjoyed it but if you’ve never seen “shark party” you can never see “shark party” it’s been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be so i will explain it to you i love sharks i love sharks more than anything people… people i can barely fucking tolerate every single year  million sharks are killed by human beings every year   people killed by sharks so when i hear about a shark attack i’m like “fuck yeah” win one for the home team so as soon as i get this show where i can do what i want i say “you know what i want to have a shark party as soon as there’s a shark attack we’re having a shark party” and i get lucky about a month into my run this guy from new zealand gets eaten by a great white the champagne of sharks and i know exactly what to do i’ve already got the script written i walk on stage in front of the cameras i say “ladies and gentlemen this guy from new zealand has been eaten by a great white shark it’s time for a shark party” lights go down music comes up six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me and we all start dancing for way too long a stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance very tasteful and then i stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten which in retrospect is where it all went wrong but i get to say my favorite thing i’ve ever said on television “smile you son of a bitch shark party” and in america where i’m famous for those types of shenanigans… everybody was like “anthony that was fucked up” “it was fucked up to see you dance” end of controversy however in new zealand where they don’t get my show they’ve never seen me and frankly they don’t get out much… the new zealand media takes the video… and they show it to the guy’s family and they say “what do you guys think about this” and they say “crikey” or whatever the fuck they say over there the point is all of new zealand all of new zealand rises up against me all  of those cunts rise up and start threatening my life now i don’t read the things that people write about me on the internet but i pay people who do and they come to me and they’re like “we’ve got some terrible news please sit down” they say “you are getting a lot of death threats online from new zealand because of ‘shark party” and i was like “really new zealand wants to kill me that’s weird because they didn’t even kill the shark” i said “how many death threats am i getting” and they were like “oh all of them you are getting all of the death threats what do you want us to do we can send someone to talk to them extra security what do you want” i said “no forget about it leave it alone don’t worry” this might be hard for some to understand i’ve said it several times tonight everyone is going to die i know full well i am going to die and most of us don’t get to choose how we check out but if i die because someone murders me over one of my jokes best case scenario if somebody murders me over one of my jokes i immediately become a legend i’m a comedy god the mount rushmore of comedy is me four times i said “come on then” my security guys are like “okay anthony well just so you know that is the dumbest thing we’ve ever heard” “but you’re the boss okay” and they leave and then the next day they come back and they say “anthony sorry to bother you again i know you didn’t care yesterday but it’s gotten much worse you’re gonna wanna hear this” they say “someone from new zealand tracked down your mom and dad’s phone number and address in pittsburgh posted that online… and now your entire family is getting death threats from new zealand” and i have to admit that had never occurred to me before it never crossed my mind… that my family my loved ones would ever pay the price be caught in harm’s way for something i’ve done or i’ve joked about and honestly i would cut my throat for my jokes i would give my life for what i do but if anyone and i mean this for a fact if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone i cared about because of a joke i’ve made even better this man is fantastic\n",
            "i watched the show  times  and i laughed so much everytime except for the eric clapton joke and sharky party all is forgivable  great material so a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is okay but a joke about a famous musician’s son falling to his death isn’t  where are your priorities they’re just jokes  it’s just syllables formed together  they’re just words people are monsters these are just words your email address will not be published required fields are marked  \n",

[cheers and applause] everybody getting in trouble, like a bunch of children. i was doing a gig in dallas, and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard. she goes, “we like our beer the way we like our violence, domestic.” right? now i got to tell you something. that’s a great fucking joke! there is zero fat on that. you need every word of that joke. you take one word out, it doesn’t work. it’s a perfect joke. so whatever, nobody gives a shit. one person comes in, they don’t like it, they ask the manager to take it down. he’s just like, “that’s our sense of humor here. have a beer, go fuck yourself. that’s what we’re doing.” she takes a picture of it, puts it on facebook. all of a sudden, people start complaining. they fired the manager and the waitress. because of that. yeah! i don’t understand, like, what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke? like, you’re some guy who would never hit a woman, ya know. would never hit a woman. you can’t hit women. you honestly cannot. you ever see how they fall? they fall like toddlers, you know? it’s like they never fell in their life. they never put their hands out. it’s horrific to watch. you can’t hit them. right? so what are you telling me? somebody… you’re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be, “wait a minute!” [shouts angrily] that’s the dumbest shit. they have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women, people still do it. what do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? they’re like so focused on hitting their wife, they got blinders on, they’re not reading anything? they don’t see the “don’t hit your wife” billboard? they’re still gonna do it. did that get too weird for you guys? did the church organs make that fucked up like i was up here? “make a pledge for jesus and hit your women.” ever watch some of those stupid religious shows? that fucking joel osteen, you ever see that guy? that guy is so full of shit, he doesn’t even open his eyes when he’s talking. “take a pledge for jesus. are they still here?” he doesn’t even have the nerve to open his eyes. “you want some popsicles? jesus wants you to have some popsicles. he wants you to have those popsicles.” his fucking electric blue carpet. yeah, everybody’s getting in trouble ’cause of these goddamn groups. look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year. old people get in trouble, right? that older woman there that makes the cookies on the food network, right? yeah, paula deen. she got in trouble, ’cause she had this slavery-themed wedding or whatever the hell she did. in defense of her, you know, you want to have an original wedding. there’s not a lot of themes left, you know? you got to use the old imagination if you’re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity, right? i’m actually gonna have a holocaust- themed pool party later on this summer. i am. “once everyone gets in ze pool, ja.” “it was weird, it was like it was offensive but like refreshing, you know? i don’t know, i don’t know how i feel about it.” yeah, she got in trouble. the old redneck on duck dynasty, that dude got in trouble. the owner of the clippers got in trouble. and i’m not saying what these people did wasn’t offensive. i’m not sayin’ that shit. what pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age, you know? they’re fucking old, you know? what did you think they thought? you never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden, it went down this crazy road? “whoa, whoa, whoa! let’s get back to the cookies, grandma! let’s leave that shit over here, what the fuck?” yeah, they’re old. what did you think they thought? i mean– i’m gonna be honest with you. people were too hard on that clippers guy, man, i’m telling you. for an 80-year-old white guy, that wasn’t that bad. all right? dude, he didn’t drop the “n” word once. that’s unbelievable for an 80-year-old white guy. the “n” word should have been carpet-bombed through that whole tape. he never said it once! if you go back and listen to that tape– go back and listen to it. other than instagram, he’s pretty fucking liberal. he’s like, “you can hang out with them, you can have sex with them, just don’t promote it on instagram.” yeah, it was the weirdest, most compartmentalized, like, racism i ever heard in my life. something about instagram, i didn’t get it. other than that, he was wide open. “you can make a snowman with them, go to a water park, rub your bellies together, just don’t promote it on instagram.” “hey, what about facebook?” “i don’t give a fuck about facebook! keep it off of instagram!” yeah. dude, you understand, the guy is 80 years old. do the math. this dude was born in 1934. that’s 13 years before jackie robinson broke the color barrier. first 12 and a half years of this guy’s life, he watched all-white baseball, and it was fine! first 12 and a half years. “up next, whitey willoughby! there’s a line shot out to peter peckerwood, what a catch! unbelievable, in to chris cracker! what a great day. what a great day for a ballgame. white baseball, white players.” dude, his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the native americans, all right? that’s who taught him his abcs. you know? “~ a, b, c, d, e… ~ hey, get that savage off my property! get out of here! i thought we killed all you people! put a fence around them! ~ h, i, j, k… ~” yeah. what did you think was gonna happen? the owner of the clippers, you know what his big crime was? he lived too long. he did. if he’d died around 1969, 1970, nobody would have noticed. dude, look at walt disney, walt disney was a known anti-semite. but he died in the early ’70s. nobody gives a shit. look at him, he’s got a castle, bunch of mice running around. nobody cares. this guy kept living. telling you, you can live too long. you can live too long, i’m telling you. you wear out your welcome. i swear to god, this fucking guy, i bet in the 1940’s, he was considered a hippie. you know? just walking around, “hey, you can hang out with ’em, you can have sex with ’em, man, you know?” his dad’s getting all pissed off: “let me tell you something, see? you stay with your own! you stay with your own.” that’s true, though. life can pass you by. it happens. you just keep living and living. basically, i think you got, like, 25, 30 years to absorb as much as you can, and then that’s it, that’s all you know. ‘cause right around then, you get married, and it’s over, right? you have a couple of kids, you’re sucked in the bubble. you don’t have time to pay attention to what’s going on out in the world. you’re stuck with these kids. “it’s shitting all over the place! don’t be a serial killer! don’t touch that!” you’re just stuck in that. you have three, four kids, that is a 25-year sentence, trying to get them all through college. society just keeps fucking going. you get the last one through college, step back out of the bubble– you don’t know what happened. you’re not even paying attention. you go back to your old record collection. [scatting] someone sticks a mike in your face, you’re gonna get in trouble. yeah. it’s one of the sad things about life. you get old and it passes you by. i feel it passing me by. i’m 46 years old. i don’t even have kids, but i can’t keep up anymore. i had a college gig coming up, i was like, i gotta figure out what these kids are into. i was 24 when a senior was born. i got to figure out what these dudes are into, so i guess they’re into like, this like dj music or some shit, so i’m like, all right, i’ll watch some of this. you know? so i have like a reference or two. i don’t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like, “what’s up with this monica lewinsky? is this crazy? i mean, this y2k– is my stylus gonna work? i don’t know.” so i put this shit on. dude, i lasted 90 seconds. ninety seconds. i was open-minded. “all right, put it on!” ninety seconds later, i’m like this old man. “ah, this isn’t music!” you know? “when i was a kid, you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil. now, that was music! and you had one ballad every album, started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in, it went to color. yeah, that was music.” yeah. all of this shit’s passing me by. i’ll get in trouble later on in my life. transgender athletes? i don’t fucking understand that, you know? i understand, you want to switch around, i don’t give a shit, but i’m a sports fan. that’s a really new concept to me, that you can be a dude, right? ranked 80th in the fucking world. you have your dick cut off, you put on a sports bra, and now you’re the #1 tennis player in the world, just coming out there with your man shoulders. [grunting] that doesn’t seem fair. i might be wrong. i might just be an old guy, i have no idea. but i’m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that mma. you can’t have that shit. am i nuts? that is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman. jesus christ! he might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight. “hold still!” “her ground and pound is incredible.” yeah. i’m not saying these people are right, and i’m not saying that i’m right. i know i’m a fucking moron, ya know. but that duck dynasty guy– i know what he said was wrong, but i don’t get the shock. said that homophobic stuff, and people are like, “can you believe?” yeah, i totally can believe it. if i was in vegas, i would have put 90% of my shit on that he was gonna say it. i’d give him a 10% benefit of the doubt just in case. are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints? like, what did you think he thought? did you think he had some progressive ideas on same-sex marriage? [cheers and applause] yeah. didn’t he think… didn’t he think exactly what you thought… he thought, you know? you know what kills me too? that fuckin’ kinda shit, that homophobic stuff, that all comes from the church, man. doesn’t it come from that shit? there’s something in there. i never read the book, all right? i tried to. they need to fucking update it. they update itunes every fuckin’ six days. can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth… for someone like me? right? that’s where he gets all those fucking ideas. that duck dynasty guy, it’s not his fault that he went to– he went to sunday school in like 1949, you know? i think all of that shit comes from the church. they just fuckin’ brainwash you. you know? don’t clap, don’t clap, i don’t read, i don’t read. follow someone else. i’m telling you, they brainwash you. come into the church, your brain’s all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut. [making squishing sounds] just brainwash you. “~ say what we say when we say it ~ ~ say it again, then you can go home to your toys ~” “~ all right, i’ll say it ~ ~ i’ll say it again ~ ~ now can i go home to my toys? ~” right? and you repeat everything they say. the good, the bad, and the fucking horrific. they stick a star on your forehead. “you’re a big boy.” “looks like people like me!” you get on with your life. you go to college, you get a master’s degree in english like this redneck dude had, he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it, right. yours goes, “whack whack!” mine goes, “whack-a-fuckin’-whack!” dude makes a zillion bucks, gets his own tv show, he’s loving life. and out of nowhere, here comes that same question sixty years later from sunday school, and he stands up like the manchurian candidate. “jesus liked hookers and lepers, doesn’t like the queers.” and everybody freaks the fuck out, and he’s like, “that’s what they said!” and they’re all dead. “oh, where’d everybody go? i thought i was a good boy!” he’s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat. i don’t understand. i don’t understand why a group like glaad, right? i always forget, it’s gay lesbian a… whatever the fuck it stands for, all right? why do they go after the old guy in the boat? why don’t they go after the people writing the book? right? “hey, could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages?” they’re not gonna do that. that’s the vatican. they’re their own city. they got a wall around their own city. they’re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it’s nothing. they’re not taking that call. “oh, what happened? really? go fuck yourself.” click. they don’t care. [applause] i learned a long time ago, i think whatever you’re into, you’re into, but i’m not into that religious stuff where– and this is why. i actually walked away from my religion. i had to be honest with myself. one, i didn’t like to go– i didn’t like going to church every week, you know? i just didn’t. part of it was i’m lazy. i don’t like getting up on sundays, and the other part was i already heard all the stories, okay? heard them three, four times, the dude hasn’t come back yet. you know, we’re just sort of mulching over the same shit here, i got it. – right? – [cheers and applause] and the other aspect was, you know, i actually– i had to be honest with myself. i felt my religion made sense and everybody else’s sounded stupid. [cackles] i did. look, i’m not talking about the basis of every religion. basis of every religion makes sense, you know, the ten commandments. don’t kill anybody. don’t touch my wife. that’s my bike. right? that all makes sense. of which, i’ve broken, i think i’ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one, that’s it. i haven’t killed anybody yet, right? but the murderous thoughts that i have sometimes, i think i could do it. like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers, and they’re wearing those gold-toed, like, dress socks, and they cross their feet at the ankles, and they just start rubbing their feet together. like, i see the whole thing, see the whole thing. wrapping that sock. shh… shh… shh… right? see the whole thing, so we’ll see. still early on, right? but just the stories of how we got here, and where we’re going, and what happens after we die, everybody else’s religion sounded stupid, you know? like, i live out in los angeles, there’s a bunch of scientologists out there, and the first time i heard the story of scientology, i was like, “that is the dumbest shit i have ever heard in my life.” [man] yeah! like, your guy’s name is ron? ron! and he wasn’t alive thousands of years ago, so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery. this guy was alive, like, 45, 50 years ago. he had a driver’s license, social security number. there’s like footage of him stubbing his toe. “motherfucker!” right? i know what happened. he was working at denny’s, he got sick of it. “i’ll start a religion. hey, everybody, there’s this spaceship coming back. everybody’s getting sneakers. this is tom cruise. we’re gonna try to make you clear, right?” look, i’m paraphrasing, i’m paraphrasing. to be fair to the scientologists, i am paraphrasing, but that’s essentially what they believe in. and i said that is the dumbest shit i ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water, died, and came back three days later. so… yeah. that made total sense to me. so it just hit me one day, i was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesn’t, you know? they got a spaceship in theirs, you know? we– right? we got the space shuttle, you know? there’s sneakers. there’s a lot of shit i can relate to in this. why does that sound so dumb to me? you know what it is? i think it’s ’cause i heard their story when i was an adult. i heard my story when i was four years old, right? when i heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me christmas toys. if i lost a tooth, there was a fairy. there was the easter bunny. why wouldn’t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever he did? of course that made sense. what happened was, as i got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? “ah, son, there is no fat fuck, it’s your mother and i. your mom’s the tooth fairy, rabbits don’t have eggs, her tits are fake, the nba is fixed! bankers are cunts! most of your dreams won’t come true!” right? and i was just like, “wow, this is how the world is.” and meanwhile this shit was just floating, this 800-pound gorilla of this fucking story. i just had to make a decision, what am i gonna do? what am i gonna do with this? am i gonna cling to it, be that person? “that’s very offensive to me and other christians and…” become that douche? all right? and be like the casual christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, “yeah, i kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, i act like i go all the time, and i don’t go anymore.” or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? just let go. [cheers and applause] just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. you know. that moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? just let me do this right, just sliding. and you think he’s along for the ride, the two of them, they’re a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking… that rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. that’s what i did with my religion. i just let go of it. i didn’t read a riot act to anybody, i just let go of it. “and on the third day, he rose again in fulfillment of the scriptures…” i just floated away. [cheers and applause] so now it’s like, i’m in this weird place where i’m not in any religion right now. unrestricted free agent. you know? [cackles] i’d like to believe in something, so i’ve been going around asking people what their shit is, and i haven’t been able to find anything. trying to be open-minded. i was doing a gig in helsinki, and over there, they’re, like, lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, you’re dead and that’s it. dead, like a pigeon, just– just layin’ there. over. blew my mind, i’m like, “really? you’re just dead?” like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? god pops in the dvd of your life. “well, i don’t know about this right here. mind explaining yourself?” this might be the most arrogant thing i say all night, but i actually resent the fact that i’m gonna get judged someday. like, if that’s true, that somebody’s gonna judge me, that doesn’t even make any sense. it’s like, dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. all right? let’s not try to turn this around on me. you know? jesus christ. you give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don’t think this thing’s gonna go off the rails? like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question… your own goddamn work. dude, if i made a car, if i built a car and it didn’t run, i wouldn’t burn it forever. “you evil piece of shit!” just light it on fire. i wouldn’t, i would troubleshoot. is there gas in the engine? is the battery charged? “anything beyond this, i got to get a real man to look at it, but i believe in you. i’m gonna try and help you out.” yes, my religion, it’s nuts. it’s fucking nuts. like, my religion, like, the way i was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldn’t, or some of your friends. doesn’t even make sense. like how am i supposed to enjoy heaven if that’s the deal, right? just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, “jesus christ, where the hell are they? it’s been, like, 150 years! they must have ate a lot of brussels sprouts or some shit! doing some yoga, right?” and then one day, it just settles in that they didn’t make it. and then what, i’m still gonna enjoy heaven, right? jesus coming walking over: “hey, how is it going, everybody? isn’t this great? isn’t this great?” “yeah, dude, it’d be even better if all my family members and friends weren’t burning for fucking ever! kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, j-star, what do you think? hey, dude, i didn’t ask you to come over. you came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. ‘hey, hey, how is it going over here?’ why did you come over here? i don’t give a damn. dude, tell your dad. i don’t give a fuck! i’m already in here, i’m already in here. what, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? go fuck yourself. i knew he was gonna be like that, i knew it. the boss’s son is the worst. fucking sense of entitlement.” so yeah, so they believe when you die, you’re dead. and i was like, so you’re just dead. like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? i couldn’t get my head around it. he goes, “well, like before, when you were born, do you remember that?” and i was like, “no,” and the guy’s like, “yeah, it’s just like that.” i’m like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. dude, i got to be honest, i hate how scared i’m getting as i get older. i’m developing all these new fears. like, i have a fear of flying now. i never had a fear of it. it’s not straight-across-the-board flying. i don’t like small planes all of a sudden. i just don’t like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. i believe in the planes, okay? i just don’t believe in the pilots. ‘cause you know what? i don’t think the airline does, either. which is why that dude is flying that little plane. the airline was basically, like, “all right, we’ll give you, like, 28 people. see how you do, you know? you fly them up, you land, you bring another 28 back. we’ll let you do this for a while. you do this for a while, we don’t get any complaints, no up and down, up and down, none of that shit, we’ll move you up to 35 people. and then one day, you’ll be in a jet–” whoo! we’re going a little faster. right? big planes, you’re getting the fuckin’ pilot that knows what he’s doing. he’s probably fought in a war. he’s used to getting shot at. he can’t bring this bus in? it’s a joke. right? a bunch of people whining in the back, “my headphones don’t work!” he doesn’t give a fuck, right? he’s up there sleeping. he’s trying to make something happen, he’s so goddamn bored. that’s a stud up there, right? so one time i’m flying into albany, new york, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. so i’m on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. all of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence. [imitating sounds of turbulence] and it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like… [nervous laughter] all of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. you can literally hear the metal the plane’s made of, like… all of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. “whoa! whaaa! whoa! whaaaa! whoa!” i’m not gonna lie, i have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. but turn around and see a 37-year-old mustachioed male going… “whoo! whaaa! whoa!” dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. i’m praying to a higher power, i don’t even believe in the shit! i just wish i had the balls to turn around and be like, “dude, would you shut the fuck up? jesus christ, be a man, push it down. push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. do some man shit right now. do some man shit.” jesus christ. you know? “you think i’m not up here thinking… ‘whaaa! whoa!’ i am! but how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house?” you know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half… whooo… whaaaa… fucking kids. and you know what? we become weaker as a species. we do. [cheers and applause] do you remember back in the day when you watched the discovery channel about animals? now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? now it’s all car stuff. “looking forward to getting that carburetor today. the carburetor didn’t fit.” “what do you mean the carburetor doesn’t fit? dad’s gonna be mad.” [yelling gibberish] there’s never enough time to build the car. it’s so fucking stupid. “we got to have this bus done by thursday!” or else what? the guy doesn’t want it anymore? all right. “you’ll get the thing when we finish it, okay? this is a safety issue. you want brakes on it? then go get yourself some fucking lunch.” so, before… [laughter] before there used to just be animals, and this is what i noticed: everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? if you had one drop of… whoo… whaaa… bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. that was it, your life was over. your life was over. no ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, ’cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. they’re like, “all right, stay away from that one. stay away from that one. he’s gonna jeopardize the whole hill. and, stacy, listen to me.” human beings have empathy. some woman will fall in love. “well, he’s nice. he wears a sweater. he likes to bake, you know? he lets me finish my stories.” which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, you’re rolling the dice. you’re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, ’cause god forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, who’s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. and you’re gonna turn around. all you’re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. i don’t know, man, that’s risky. you know, in reality, i’m being too hard on that guy. yeah, i am. i am, ’cause i was just as scared as he was. except i didn’t scream out like he did, and that’s simple. the simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. having people going, “how was your day? what’s wrong?” and all of that shit, you know? that’s why i came down here. i came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. you are ruining this country. now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that you’re a good man, and to find another man like you. you got to do that. but your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock ’em down, right? “come on, it didn’t hurt, get up!” i didn’t come from a family, i don’t know about you guys, i didn’t come from a touchy-feely… “call me when you get there. mwah, mwah.” none of that shit. first time my mom hugged me, i think, was like, once when i was little, and when i moved out. that was it! and we only hugged ’cause we knew we were supposed to. so we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. it was horrific. fucking horrific. to this day, sometimes i drive down the street, and i think about that hug, and it’s just so awful i have to like shout the memory out of my head. i’ll just be driving down the street, just be like… aaaaah! anybody else like that? you ever have to shout stuff out of your head? there’s something about me, like, all my regret comes up when i’m in the shower. i don’t know what it is. i think ’cause i’m in the shower, and i have time to think, and i’ll just think of shit i did in third grade where i just made an ass of myself, and i’ll just be in the shower just being like… [screaming] and my wife’s always just like, “is everything okay in there?” i’ll just be like, “yeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. turned it on too much.” “every day?” so… yeah… i actually asked my mother one time when i finally got out in the world, and i saw how other families interacted, i finally asked her, “how come we never did the hugging thing? how come we didn’t do that stuff?” she was like, “i wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but i was afraid it was gonna make you gay.” and i was like, “you were afraid?” and she goes, “well, it was your father. that’s what it was. protecting him like i always do. he was afraid. he said, you don’t know how to raise boys and if you hug them, that’s what’s gonna happen. so in a marriage, there’s compromises.” yeah, so she basically never hugged us, ’cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. and i got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. let me finish before you start blogging, okay? and i end up on a split screen on good morning atlanta. “comedy, could it go too far? last night at the tabernacle–” sitting there next to some fucking cheeto-eating blogger. so, yeah, this is the deal. i’m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid. as far as i know. i don’t have any kids. as far as i’d think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? you want to improve on your childhood, okay? you want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn’t work. so that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesn’t talk about going to war. so i figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, “don’t change his shitty diaper. let him figure it out for himself. get out in the rain, you shitty baby! hey, let me handle this, lady! why are you still standing here, you shit toddler?” so he took it from that… and knocked it down to, “don’t hug him, it’s gonna make him gay.” right? and then maybe someday i ever have a kid, i’ll whittle it down to like, “he’s not taking drama class, all right? he’s not taking drama class ’cause i said so, lady! let me handle this!” i won’t fix everything. and that’s not a homophobic thing either, that i wouldn’t send my hypothetical son to drama class. okay? it isn’t. i would send… i’d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. okay. my son can’t fucking do any of that shit unless i’m sending him to one of those fame high schools where everybody’s doing it, one of those creative schools. you go to the cafeteria, everybody’s like, ~ cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ then he can do all he wants. then he can do all the fuck he wants, but there’s no way i’m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! he’s gonna get the shit kicked out of him! he’s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then i have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, “there’s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here!” i don’t want to do that. i want to find the fucking eight-year-old. what is he, this tall? i want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. you wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he’s down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. “you ever do that again, i’m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog.” all right? [applause] over. so yeah, a lot in my life has changed since i last came through here to atlanta. i got married. that’s the big thing. yes, i did. very happy about that. i’m very happy because it was starting to get weird. it’s like 45 years old. “my girlfriend, yeah, we’re gonna go out and get some pop.” going to parties, it was just weird. ‘cause i hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. i just couldn’t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage… marriages and kids. i felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, “the superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the middle eastern crisis, it’s just…” “it’s an advanced learning program. the deadline is may 11th. we have to stop the bullying…” “…with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate.” when the conversation would come around to me, i felt like i was eight years old. i’d just be like, “did anybody see the youtube video where the raccoon stole the cat’s food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn’t care? he just came in like this, like george foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. all of a sudden, he had hands. i didn’t know they had hands. he scooped it up and he ran away on paws. did you guys know they had hands?” so now i’m married, so the next move is you’re supposed to have a kid, which i would love to do, but i’m 46 years old. i’m just thinking it’s too fucking late, ya know. come on, man, i’m gonna have a kid, i’m gonna die of natural causes when the kid’s in fifth grade. throwing him a frisbee. “we used to use these on a saturday.” do a face plant. my kid’s standing there, “mom, dad’s sleeping again!” i feel hopelessly behind. all my friends have kids. most of my friends who have kids are cool, but i got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that i don’t understand anything anymore. you know those people? the most basic shit. “hey, man, it’s kind of cold out today.” “dude, you don’t understand. you don’t understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and you’re trying to get chocolate off the other one’s face.” “all right, all right, i get it, you have a more complex life, but i still understand being cold, teeth chattering. kind of lets me know. right?” “mine just turned six.” “mine just turned seven.” i just feel hopelessly behind. so what i’m actually thinking of doing, i’m thinking about adopting. yeah. absolutely, recycle. you know? think globally, act locally. everything doesn’t have to be brand-new. you know? it’s like when you redo your kitchen. you got custom up top, you got ikea down the bottom, right? i’d love to adopt. it’s a great thing to do. but if i do it, i’m not telling any of my friends. i’m just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss ’em off. “mine just turned six.” “mine just turned seven.” i’d love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, “dominoes! yeah, now i get to tell you what you don’t understand. seven-year-old? wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. terrible twos? try the instant eights! bam! they’re just there, like…! with all their issues…!” i should do it, though. i should adopt. i think it’s a great thing to do, and i already know what i want to get. i do. i want to get, like, an ’07, ’08… always garaged, good dentition. do you know what i would love to do? i’d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. wouldn’t that be amazing? like, find the kid that made this shirt? just show up at the factory like, hey! “come on, bring it in! bring it in, you little maniac! how you doing? you’re going back to the states. l-shaped couch, flat screen tv. get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, you’re coming home with me!” yeah. dude, how easy… how easy would that kid be to raise? after the hell he’s been through, all i gotta do is let him sit down. i am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. just bring him home. “have a seat.” he’ll be like, “i get to sit down?” “yeah, lay down on the couch.” he’ll be like, “it’s like a cloud! it’s like a cloud!” i’ll get him a bowl of fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop sports. i don’t know. the kid would love me. so that’s my first draft pick. all right? coming out of the gate with that. in the second round, i’d probably get like an ’05 boy soldier, ya know. yeah, shore up the offensive line. you gotta protect the blindside. that’s how fucked up the world is, there’s little boys out there fighting in wars. so that’s a twofer. i can drag him out of that hell, give him something of what’s left of his childhood, and, god forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? shit goes south, zombies take over, i got backup. everybody thinks i’m gonna be the problem, meanwhile, i got this sawed-off chuck norris… standing next to me, 170 kills, confirmed fucking kills. they’re not stories! can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. you can’t coach that, right? i got to be honest with you, i feel like i’d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. i might be nuts, but i feel like i could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? “i said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. i’m getting sick of this shit! goes for you too if you want. but you! you’ve been out of line all day, mister! don’t even start that shit! don’t even start that shit. you say that every time. yes, you do. every fucking time you say that. you know the answer. you want me to say it again? i’ll break it down to you. you know why it is? you want to know why? ‘cause you sew. all right? yeah. you sew. dude, he’s fucking killed people. do you understand that? no, he doesn’t, he doesn’t have to make his bed too. no, he doesn’t. because he doesn’t sleep in the bed, he’s out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? oh, fuck you, fuck you! he scares me too, he scares me too. don’t even start that shit. you wanted a big brother, and i got you one. don’t even start that shit, all right? all right, you’re right. stop crying, stop crying. shouldn’t have yelled at you. i just thought i could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of pop tarts, i figured he’d chill out. fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that full metal jacket shit. no, you can’t give him back, it doesn’t work that way. there he is, there he is! what’s up, buddy? what’s going on? we were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. you feeling all right? you feeling all right? you’re not looking through those eyebrows, huh? everything okay?” so i figure, uh… i don’t know if i’ll do it. maybe i’m too selfish. i have no idea. i’m all over the fuckin’ map. do you know what i want to do right now? i actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. i do, that’s my latest thing. you know why it is? it’s ’cause i live in los angeles. yeah, and it’s an absolute clusterfuck. when you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. there’s not even zoning laws. they’ll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then there’s, like, a fucking daycare center. right? the city doesn’t even work even when everything else works, so god forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? see, you guys are all right out here in atlanta. you’re all right. i don’t know, maybe in atlanta might be crazy. you’re on the outskirts, you’re fine. you’re fine. you don’t live in a desert. you slam your face in a birdbath, you’re cool. drink that water for a good 30 days. l.a., there’s nowhere to go. that’s why i love the helicopter. dude, the helicopter is the ultimate “fuck this, i’m out” vehicle. all you gotta do is assess the situation. zombie coming up the street? “fuck this! this looks safe.” you just land it. you could sit there hovering. just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. yeah, so i told my wife i want to fly a helicopter. she’s just like, “yeah, no.” which i know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. just that she said that shit, then i was just gonna be like, “oh, all right. thought i was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so… there goes that. hey, what other dreams aren’t i gonna get to achieve? like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask?” yeah, i’m still gonna do it, i’m just not gonna tell her. i’m just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when i get my license, i’m not going to tell her. i’m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. she’s just gonna be like, “what is that? what is that for? what does that mean?” “yeah, someday you’ll see, someday you’ll see. when the shit hits the fan, and you’re freaking the fuck out, and i’m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter.” “what is that?” “shut the fuck up and get in!” now you guys think i’m bullshitting, i’m not. i’m serious. i’m 100% in on this. and ever since i got into it, i’m seeing helicopters everywhere. i never realized how many helicopters there were. driving down the street like henry hill looking up at them… doing key bumps and shit. “they’re after me! swear to god!” i’m seeing stories about them! it’s just like that old advertising anecdote. “i never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until i needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, they’re all over the place. and then i bought a mattress and then it all went away.” it’s the same shit. i saw this story down in orange county. right? down in orange county, california. this guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years– 30 years without incident. hands the business off to his son, the american dream. “i built it up for 30 years. here you go, son. make the family and the family name proud.” “all right, dad, i love you.” all right? this poor kid, five days in, he’s supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. the kid thought it was weird, but he’s like, “i need the money. i gotta give him a tour.” right? so he takes this guy up. ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. yeah, five days in. five days in from the balloons and the cake. “we love you, son. keep the family tree going. the traditional line.” five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. just sitting there, flying the helicopter. “all right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, that’s orange county. there’s over 27 miles of beaches there. put your seatbelt back on, 27 miles of beaches. was established as a county in 1903. sir, please don’t open the door. sir, what are you doing? sir, no, no. don’t, don’t, stop, no, no! what the fuck? what the fuck? oh, my god. oh, my god. oh, my god. what the fuck, what the fuck?! fuck!” air traffic control: “i don’t know who’s on this frequency, but you really need–” “somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter!” five days in. so i read further into the story. turns out the guy who jumped out, he was 61 years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. they couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. at that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. know what i love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didn’t go out like some pussy, right? handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that nana made. fuck that. guy went out like a man. “take me up in a chopper, i’m looking at the land i love, and then i’m jumping out like a superhero.” i loved it. yeah. [applause] this guy should have been wearing a fucking cape. i can’t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life, like, “fuck you, disease. i decide.” ripping tubes out, gets a burger, shotguns a beer. “take me up in the chopper.” he probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard. he’s not even listening to this guy giving the tour. right? “over 27 miles of beaches, put your seatbelt back on. established as a county in 1903. sir, please don’t try to open the door. no, no, don’t, don’t, don’t!” [screams] [imitates wind whipping] incredible! but here’s the thing. i left out one small thing. there is one small thing. the guy fucking lived. yeah. yeah, they were out over the ocean, 500 feet up. you’d think that would be enough so, i’m thinking he must have gone in like greg louganis, like, no splash, just… but witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air. so that sounds like a hell of an impact. i think he accidentally did the most epic 500-foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter. but that didn’t change what he was trying to do. where his heart was, i still love this guy. i just feel bad for him. on the way down, he’s got to be thinking, “three more seconds of pain! two more seconds!” wham! [agonized scream] “oh, my god, this is worse! this is way worse!” it has a happy ending, though. he later died at the hospital. that’s right. so here’s to him. god bless him. i hope i have the balls someday. so where do you go from there? well, as i mentioned, last time i came through town, i wanted to get a gun. you know? i do. yeah. but i’ve finally given up on that. i gave up on that dream. my wife doesn’t want me to get one, so. yeah, she didn’t want– dude, you got to pick your fucking battles. i’m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly, i can’t fucking have some .357 hanging around. “i’ll do whatever i want. all right? what i say goes! eat it!” can’t be that person. now it fucking bums me out, ’cause all i wanted to do was just get a .22, that’s all i wanted. perfect gun for home protection, .22 caliber. you’re laughing at that, sir? that’s not enough? i don’t know. i’m down south. what do you think? that’s not enough, right? you want– shotgun, right? .44? you guys are out of your minds. you’re out of your fucking minds. let me ask all you gun guys, who are gonna make fun if i had a .22. “what’s with your .22? that little queer gun. do you keep it between your buttocks? is that the holster? is that what you do with your gay little gun? you need a big gun.” all you fucking guys. let me ask you this, all you guys with your guns… have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs? have you ever done that? or you’re like most people, you take it down to the gun range, you put your earplugs in, put your headset on, take it out of the briefcase. you got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses, right? you look at your spread or whatever, and then you put it back in there, right? you ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs? ‘cause that’s what’s gonna happen when that intruder comes in. you’re not gonna have time to be, “hang on a second, let me just…” yeah, you’re not gonna have time. dude, i shot a five-shot .38 one time without earplugs. i was landscaping this guy’s yard. he comes out at the end of the job. “hey, i got this five-shot .38. you want to go down the street? there’s a burned-out car. we can take a couple of shots.” you know what’s funny? every other state is fuckin’ dying laughing at this point in the joke because it’s so goddamn ridiculous, until i get down to the south. and you guys just sit here staring at me like, “all right, so what happened? pretty standard, i thought this was gonna be a comedy show. you’re reading from your journal? i don’t understand what the– it’s not a real compelling story.” i’m mowing a fucking lawn, and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says, “let’s shoot it at a burned-out car!” okay? jesus christ, can we agree on that? so i’m like, all right, let’s do it, fuck it. so i go down there. never shot a gun before. i bring the gun up, point it at the car, i pull the trigger. i saw the muzzle flash, i felt a kick, i never heard the gun. i pulled the trigger, all i just heard was… [high-pitched tone] i shot the gun four more times. never heard it. didn’t get louder, didn’t get quieter. just kept seeing flashes. [high-pitched tone] all right? so let’s take one of your fucking guns. let’s just say, for the sake of argument. all right, you got that thing sitting on a nightstand, loaded. right? for god’s sakes, tell me you have it there. don’t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there. you got the thing fucking loaded, ready to go. 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, this is when the psycho’s coming in too, right? that’s when they come in, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. they don’t come by at 6:30 at night, as you’re cutting into a pork chop. “i’m out of my mind, i’m coming back in 20 minutes, so stretch out your hammies ’cause it’s gonna get crazy.” that’s not how it works. they wait till you’re dead asleep, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, right before rem sleep is kicking in. so let’s just say for the sake of argument, all you gun guys, you got your thing loaded, right? your piece, right? right there, loaded for bear. you’re lying there, same scenario, right? one leg under the covers, one without. shirt. 4:00 in the morning, you’re just… [snoring] meanwhile, some psycho, sneaking in through the living room window, right? he brings in a fucking sickle. and he’s just listening. listens all the way down that hall and he just hears… [snoring] he’s trying not to squeak on the floorboards. and you’re just fucking lying there. [snoring] all of a sudden, that little dog on the floor is just like… [low growling] [growling and snoring continue] “what’s the matter? what’s the matter? what’s the matter? what’s the matter, boy? you hear something? what’s the matter? what are you barking for? you’re shaking. what’s the matter, huh? you hear something? what’s–? come on, man, quit fucking around. i got to go to work tomorrow.” [snoring] all of a sudden, boom! that door flies open. you just see this shadowy figure. you pick up that gun. blam! [high-pitched tone] and you fucking miss! you miss! you can’t see, now you can’t hear. that’s two out of five senses! what, are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed? you’re still gonna be shooting over here. meanwhile, you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed. takes off your head. if you had the .22, you could still hear. your ears would be ringing, but you could hear that fucker coming across, and you could shoot at him, and he would leave. he would leave. you guys just won’t get off the fact that it’s a fuckin’ .22. you’re, like, psychotic with this shit. all right. no, no, no, no, no, no, no. let me– i will extend an olive branch to you people, okay? i get it. i get it that a .22 is basically a ‘roided-up bb gun. i got it, okay? i understand that if you actually want to kill somebody, you have to basically have the gun up to somebody’s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger. i understand that. okay? but i maintain, i don’t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house. i could defend my house with a bb gun. i don’t give a fuck how tough you are. i don’t care. if i started shooting at you with a bb gun, at the very least, you have to go back outside and regroup. that’s a fact. that is a fact. if i caught you in your elbow, that might be the end of your night. “look, i’m coming back, i’m coming back!” i’ve been trying to get along with my wife better. i’m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship. i’m not turning out the pilot light, though. all right? i’m keeping some fight in me. i’m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like, “i guess we’re making holiday cookies.” that dude with the bowed shoulders. “she makes them and then i’m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them. i don’t even think they taste that good, but just–” no, i stand my ground sometimes. sometimes i let it go. you just got to figure it out. we had a fight the other night, she got so mad at me, she was like, “you can just sleep downstairs. you can just sleep downstairs.” i couldn’t believe it. it’s one of the most arrogant things i’ve ever heard in my life. one adult telling another adult where they can sleep. “you can just sleep downstairs.” like i was just gonna sit up in bed, grab a blanket like linus. “all right. hey, where downstairs, by the way? like, over here downstairs, or like more over here? where should i sleep?” it’s like, are you out of your mind? i go, “i’m not sleeping downstairs.” she’s like, “where you gonna sleep, then?” i’m like, “where i always sleep. i will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if i want to! what are you gonna do? i’m bigger than you. i’ll hang onto the covers, try to get me out. no tickling. go ahead!” yeah, i was like, “you don’t tell me where to sleep. i sleep where i want to sleep.” she’s like, “well, you don’t tell me where to sleep.” i’m like, “i’m not the one telling people where to sleep!” it was one of those classic relationship fights. it’s like 2:00 in the morning, you’re both half naked. she’s not wearing a bra, you got half a ball hanging out. “and another thing! no, no, i need to say this! the other day, i felt slighted!” it’s fuckin’ unreal, but what kills me is that there’s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit. yeah, you talk to them, they’ll be, “hey, how’s it been going?” “it’s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch. you know how that is, right?” no, i don’t. i don’t understand. how did you get yourself into that situation? like, what are you afraid of? what is she gonna do if you say no? what, is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table? i understand if you’re dating some woman and she does that ufc mma shit, then you got to sleep where she says to sleep, you got to. she’s gonna come at you. “well, let’s get you in an arm bar.” “all right, all right, all right!” tapping out. or even worse, she chokes you out. you wake up on the couch, like, 11 minutes later. just grab your jacket off the back of the couch. “i fucking hate when she does this. it’s like, it’s not even fair. have a debate like a normal person.” all right? i’m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here, someone who’s actually been sleeping on the couch, okay? so there’s the first fear, out the window. okay, she can’t physically dominate you, so that’s gone. what’s the next fear? she’s gonna cut off the sex. yeah, rub one out. neutralized. it’s the most empty threat there is. do it right in front of her. “join me!” yeah. i’ve never understood that threat. that’s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator, but you got a sandwich in your pocket, a never-ending sandwich, like some biblical shit, like jesus with the fucking bread or whatever. so now what’s the last thing she can do? what can she do now? be moody? you can’t handle that? walk by your tv without looking at you. only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen. who gives a fuck? my wife does that, i just sit there, i just start commentating. “here she comes again, walking by the tv. she really must be mad.” she’s never body-slammed me once, ever. i’m not saying to be a dick. all right? i’m just saying, you got to keep them honest. every once in a while, you got to have a little pushback. “hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.” rest of the shit– i’m learning that about women. you just want to keep them calm. just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? just everything’s cool, everything’s cool, just, “yeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, i’m having a great time. no, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. i am talking to people, i’m talking to people, i am having a good time here.” that’s what you do. you just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. here’s an olive branch i’ve extended to her. it’s basically… we fight a lot over television. i’ve kind of come her way, she’s come my way. she watches a little bit of sports, i occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. which, i don’t care, the nerd’s gonna fuck the cheerleader. i’ll watch it, right? i don’t mind them, it’s an uplifting story. i just don’t like the love scenes in romantic comedies. they creep me out. they’re just so fucking nice. it’s, like, missionary-style. there’s candles. that stupid saxophone music. [imitates saxophone] it always goes down. like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? ‘cause they can’t show it. they got to make her this one-dimensional, this little angel. they ignore the other 90% of her sexuality. no hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. none of that taboo stuff of a woman’s sexuality. that’s never brought up. that whole “hold me down but let me up, but hold me down. choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. i want to feel your power but i want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to.” that whole fifty shades of rape, whatever the hell that is. yeah. i don’t even pretend to understand it. i remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. i didn’t even know what she was doing. i was just so psyched to be getting laid, i was like… and she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. i didn’t know what she was doing. i thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. and finally, i was just like, “what are you doing?” she says, like, “i don’t know. i just kinda like, ya know. it’s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. why don’t you want to do it? it’ll be fun.” why don’t i want to do it? i don’t think i want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. having the cops show up. “yeah, she’s in here, officer. damndest thing, it was her idea. i swear to god, it was her idea!” yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. the raciest thing they’ll do is every once in a while, they’ll kiss up against a wall. i guess women like walls. i didn’t know that. a lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. “oh, my god, it’s the wall. oh, my god! it’s supporting me, maybe he’ll support me, it’s a metaphor, i love it.” yeah, i saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. i’m like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? but they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. all she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. he was off to the races. i ruined the movie for my wife. i’m like, “that is fucking bullshit! bullshit.” what does the guy have, like, a u-shaped dick? how is he doing anything? is he sticking it in her navel? did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? like, if all she’s gonna do is this, she’s got to bring it up like an offsides call, if that’s what she’s doing. all right? if not, you got to make some adjustments. you just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles. [screaming] maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they’re like, “all right, this is ridiculous, okay? my calves are burning, i can’t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. i can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world.” these guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like they’re not heavy. they start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. dude, i’m not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. yeah, you’re heavy. you’re an adult female! jesus christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? when they’re, like, five or six? “get off of me! jesus christ. you’re gonna throw out my back. go jump on your brother.” an adult woman weighs 115 pounds, 120, all the way up to god knows what. and it’s not balanced weight. most of it’s in your thighs and in your ass. your head’s hanging off trying to counterbalance. dude, when guys go to the gym, we don’t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck-80 over here. “fuckin’ yeah!” yeah, it’s ridiculous. trying to carry a naked woman, it’s like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. you’re, like, bumping into shit. when you see the bed, you don’t walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibe’s ruined, and you’re back to your sandwich in your pocket. all right, i’m out of time. you guys were awesome. thank you so much. thank you, thank you. i had a great time. i’ll see you next time. thank you. [cheers and applause] what a wanker not funny at all just fucking screaming  shit like dribble running down his chin.  yawn bill burr is a comedic genius!  he has the courage to make people laugh at some very serious issues in life, by identifying that the issues can be perceived in a different context, one that is much more realistic than people would think.  his parody of catholicism and christianity, and how god and jesus might actually be thinking or feeling helped me truly lighten up and ended up changing my reactions, behavior and feelings about being judged and judging others and myself.  anyway, any deed that results in people feeling more understanding and tolerant and less judgmental is a blessing.  don’t let yourself get caught up in a stereotype when perceiving something as you believe others expect you to do.  the truth shall set you free.\n",

            " all right, thank you! thank you very much! thank you. thank you. thank you. how are you? what’s going on? thank you. it’s a pleasure to be here in the greater atlanta, georgia, area, this oasis. it’s nice to be here. i don’t know why i came here in june. it’s nice to be here. wasn’t thinking. fucking ridiculously hot out there. just miserable, horrible. that kind of heat, you understand the racism down here, ya know? i get it. how would you get along with anybody? “look at ’em just over there, drinkin’ a cold drink! lemonade was made for the white man!” so… what the hell have i been doing with my life? trying to get in shape, man. but i hate going to the gym, so i decided i’d go veggie twice a week. it’s brutal. i can only make it till about 5:00. five o’clock, that’s what i realized about myself, you know that? something has to die every day in order for me to live. something’s got to get its beak chopped off, its feathers yanked, uppercut to its jaw, just in order for me to survive. i’m trying! couscous and all that shit. it’s awful. i saw this thing, though. they said if everybody went vegan, if everybody went vegan or vegetarian, whatever the hell they said. one of those “v” ones, right? they said it’ll be great for the environment, you know. i guess there’s all this cattle standing around, and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something. right? they’re always doing that shit. you know, “if everybody went vegan, the air would be– if everybody drove an electric car, if everybody just had some snowshoes on.” right? they just won’t come out and say it. nobody has the balls to come out and just say, “look, 85% of you have to go.” – that’s it! that is it. –  i have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row. waiting… for some politician to have the balls to bring it up, but they won’t do it, they won’t do it. we live in a democracy. right? can’t be honest in a democracy. you need the votes. you can’t run with that as your platform. coming out there: “and if elected, i would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least 85% of you! this planet cannot sustain the sheer numbers– let me finish! this will not be arbitrary. under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire! if you did not bring a pencil, you’re already out!” you can’t do that. you got to be nice. you got to be fuckin’ nice, especially this day and age. everybody getting in trouble, all these goddamn groups out there, bitch, moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything. “we’re part of a group, eh.” you gotta apologize. “i’m sorry to people who own shar peis. i didn’t mean to say that it’s an ugly-ass dog, nah.” right? fuck you and your group. what about that? what do you got, two million people in your group? there’s 400 million in this country. nobody gives a shit. right? who the fuck joins a group? “i’m gonna join a group, that’s what i’m gonna do today.” go to meetings. what kind of a fucking loser, right? that’s the same way i look at people who got upset about, you know, michael sam, the gay football player kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted. everybody bitch, moaning and complaining. it’s like, dude, that’s what you get for watching the draft, all right? now once again, what kind of a fucking loser just sits there watching round after round? “the jets are up next. i think they need a quarterback. they need to improve their defensive line.” dude, that’s like going to a graduation ceremony where you don’t know anybody who’s graduating. you’re just fucking sitting there. they’re gonna have the whole list the next day. they’ll have everybody. who drafted who, when. fucking got to sit there and watch that shit. those stupid interviews. “yeah, you’re a member of the buffalo bills. how does it feel?” “well, you know, it’s a blessing. i want to thank god. gonna try to do my best, it’s a great organization, and the same shit the last 80 guys said. so, yeah.” yeah. i’m glad he kissed him. he should have fuckin’ blown him. yeah! with birthday cake in his mouth and a santa claus hat on his head, just to ruin the entire year. holding a flag. that fucks up flag day. you’ll keep thinking about it. yeah. fucking stupid-ass groups. people apologizing to ’em like they have some sort of power. look, if you’re being a dick, apologize. but other than that, yeah, go fuck yourself. yeah.  everybody getting in trouble, like a bunch of children. i was doing a gig in dallas, and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard. she goes, “we like our beer the way we like our violence, domestic.” right? now i got to tell you something. that’s a great fucking joke! there is zero fat on that. you need every word of that joke. you take one word out, it doesn’t work. it’s a perfect joke. so whatever, nobody gives a shit. one person comes in, they don’t like it, they ask the manager to take it down. he’s just like, “that’s our sense of humor here. have a beer, go fuck yourself. that’s what we’re doing.” she takes a picture of it, puts it on facebook. all of a sudden, people start complaining. they fired the manager and the waitress. because of that. yeah! i don’t understand, like, what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke? like, you’re some guy who would never hit a woman, ya know. would never hit a woman. you can’t hit women. you honestly cannot. you ever see how they fall? they fall like toddlers, you know? it’s like they never fell in their life. they never put their hands out. it’s horrific to watch. you can’t hit them. right? so what are you telling me? somebody… you’re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be, “wait a minute!”  that’s the dumbest shit. they have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women, people still do it. what do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? they’re like so focused on hitting their wife, they got blinders on, they’re not reading anything? they don’t see the “don’t hit your wife” billboard? they’re still gonna do it. did that get too weird for you guys? did the church organs make that fucked up like i was up here? “make a pledge for jesus and hit your women.” ever watch some of those stupid religious shows? that fucking joel osteen, you ever see that guy? that guy is so full of shit, he doesn’t even open his eyes when he’s talking. “take a pledge for jesus. are they still here?” he doesn’t even have the nerve to open his eyes. “you want some popsicles? jesus wants you to have some popsicles. he wants you to have those popsicles.” his fucking electric blue carpet. yeah, everybody’s getting in trouble ’cause of these goddamn groups. look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year. old people get in trouble, right? that older woman there that makes the cookies on the food network, right? yeah, paula deen. she got in trouble, ’cause she had this slavery-themed wedding or whatever the hell she did. in defense of her, you know, you want to have an original wedding. there’s not a lot of themes left, you know? you got to use the old imagination if you’re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity, right? i’m actually gonna have a holocaust- themed pool party later on this summer. i am. “once everyone gets in ze pool, ja.” “it was weird, it was like it was offensive but like refreshing, you know? i don’t know, i don’t know how i feel about it.” yeah, she got in trouble. the old redneck on duck dynasty, that dude got in trouble. the owner of the clippers got in trouble. and i’m not saying what these people did wasn’t offensive. i’m not sayin’ that shit. what pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age, you know? they’re fucking old, you know? what did you think they thought? you never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden, it went down this crazy road? “whoa, whoa, whoa! let’s get back to the cookies, grandma! let’s leave that shit over here, what the fuck?” yeah, they’re old. what did you think they thought? i mean– i’m gonna be honest with you. people were too hard on that clippers guy, man, i’m telling you. for an 80-year-old white guy, that wasn’t that bad. all right? dude, he didn’t drop the “n” word once. that’s unbelievable for an 80-year-old white guy. the “n” word should have been carpet-bombed through that whole tape. he never said it once! if you go back and listen to that tape– go back and listen to it. other than instagram, he’s pretty fucking liberal. he’s like, “you can hang out with them, you can have sex with them, just don’t promote it on instagram.” yeah, it was the weirdest, most compartmentalized, like, racism i ever heard in my life. something about instagram, i didn’t get it. other than that, he was wide open. “you can make a snowman with them, go to a water park, rub your bellies together, just don’t promote it on instagram.” “hey, what about facebook?” “i don’t give a fuck about facebook! keep it off of instagram!” yeah. dude, you understand, the guy is 80 years old. do the math. this dude was born in 1934. that’s 13 years before jackie robinson broke the color barrier. first 12 and a half years of this guy’s life, he watched all-white baseball, and it was fine! first 12 and a half years. “up next, whitey willoughby! there’s a line shot out to peter peckerwood, what a catch! unbelievable, in to chris cracker! what a great day. what a great day for a ballgame. white baseball, white players.” dude, his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the native americans, all right? that’s who taught him his abcs. you know? “~ a, b, c, d, e… ~ hey, get that savage off my property! get out of here! i thought we killed all you people! put a fence around them! ~ h, i, j, k… ~” yeah. what did you think was gonna happen? the owner of the clippers, you know what his big crime was? he lived too long. he did. if he’d died around 1969, 1970, nobody would have noticed. dude, look at walt disney, walt disney was a known anti-semite. but he died in the early ’70s. nobody gives a shit. look at him, he’s got a castle, bunch of mice running around. nobody cares. this guy kept living. telling you, you can live too long. you can live too long, i’m telling you. you wear out your welcome. i swear to god, this fucking guy, i bet in the 1940’s, he was considered a hippie. you know? just walking around, “hey, you can hang out with ’em, you can have sex with ’em, man, you know?” his dad’s getting all pissed off: “let me tell you something, see? you stay with your own! you stay with your own.” that’s true, though. life can pass you by. it happens. you just keep living and living. basically, i think you got, like, 25, 30 years to absorb as much as you can, and then that’s it, that’s all you know. ‘cause right around then, you get married, and it’s over, right? you have a couple of kids, you’re sucked in the bubble. you don’t have time to pay attention to what’s going on out in the world. you’re stuck with these kids. “it’s shitting all over the place! don’t be a serial killer! don’t touch that!” you’re just stuck in that. you have three, four kids, that is a 25-year sentence, trying to get them all through college. society just keeps fucking going. you get the last one through college, step back out of the bubble– you don’t know what happened. you’re not even paying attention. you go back to your old record collection.  someone sticks a mike in your face, you’re gonna get in trouble. yeah. it’s one of the sad things about life. you get old and it passes you by. i feel it passing me by. i’m 46 years old. i don’t even have kids, but i can’t keep up anymore. i had a college gig coming up, i was like, i gotta figure out what these kids are into. i was 24 when a senior was born. i got to figure out what these dudes are into, so i guess they’re into like, this like dj music or some shit, so i’m like, all right, i’ll watch some of this. you know? so i have like a reference or two. i don’t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like, “what’s up with this monica lewinsky? is this crazy? i mean, this y2k– is my stylus gonna work? i don’t know.” so i put this shit on. dude, i lasted 90 seconds. ninety seconds. i was open-minded. “all right, put it on!” ninety seconds later, i’m like this old man. “ah, this isn’t music!” you know? “when i was a kid, you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil. now, that was music! and you had one ballad every album, started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in, it went to color. yeah, that was music.” yeah. all of this shit’s passing me by. i’ll get in trouble later on in my life. transgender athletes? i don’t fucking understand that, you know? i understand, you want to switch around, i don’t give a shit, but i’m a sports fan. that’s a really new concept to me, that you can be a dude, right? ranked 80th in the fucking world. you have your dick cut off, you put on a sports bra, and now you’re the #1 tennis player in the world, just coming out there with your man shoulders.  that doesn’t seem fair. i might be wrong. i might just be an old guy, i have no idea. but i’m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that mma. you can’t have that shit. am i nuts? that is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman. jesus christ! he might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight. “hold still!” “her ground and pound is incredible.” yeah. i’m not saying these people are right, and i’m not saying that i’m right. i know i’m a fucking moron, ya know. but that duck dynasty guy– i know what he said was wrong, but i don’t get the shock. said that homophobic stuff, and people are like, “can you believe?” yeah, i totally can believe it. if i was in vegas, i would have put 90% of my shit on that he was gonna say it. i’d give him a 10% benefit of the doubt just in case. are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints? like, what did you think he thought? did you think he had some progressive ideas on same-sex marriage?  yeah. didn’t he think… didn’t he think exactly what you thought… he thought, you know? you know what kills me too? that fuckin’ kinda shit, that homophobic stuff, that all comes from the church, man. doesn’t it come from that shit? there’s something in there. i never read the book, all right? i tried to. they need to fucking update it. they update itunes every fuckin’ six days. can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth… for someone like me? right? that’s where he gets all those fucking ideas. that duck dynasty guy, it’s not his fault that he went to– he went to sunday school in like 1949, you know? i think all of that shit comes from the church. they just fuckin’ brainwash you. you know? don’t clap, don’t clap, i don’t read, i don’t read. follow someone else. i’m telling you, they brainwash you. come into the church, your brain’s all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut.  just brainwash you. “~ say what we say when we say it ~ ~ say it again, then you can go home to your toys ~” “~ all right, i’ll say it ~ ~ i’ll say it again ~ ~ now can i go home to my toys? ~” right? and you repeat everything they say. the good, the bad, and the fucking horrific. they stick a star on your forehead. “you’re a big boy.” “looks like people like me!” you get on with your life. you go to college, you get a master’s degree in english like this redneck dude had, he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it, right. yours goes, “whack whack!” mine goes, “whack-a-fuckin’-whack!” dude makes a zillion bucks, gets his own tv show, he’s loving life. and out of nowhere, here comes that same question sixty years later from sunday school, and he stands up like the manchurian candidate. “jesus liked hookers and lepers, doesn’t like the queers.” and everybody freaks the fuck out, and he’s like, “that’s what they said!” and they’re all dead. “oh, where’d everybody go? i thought i was a good boy!” he’s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat. i don’t understand. i don’t understand why a group like glaad, right? i always forget, it’s gay lesbian a… whatever the fuck it stands for, all right? why do they go after the old guy in the boat? why don’t they go after the people writing the book? right? “hey, could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages?” they’re not gonna do that. that’s the vatican. they’re their own city. they got a wall around their own city. they’re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it’s nothing. they’re not taking that call. “oh, what happened? really? go fuck yourself.” click. they don’t care.  i learned a long time ago, i think whatever you’re into, you’re into, but i’m not into that religious stuff where– and this is why. i actually walked away from my religion. i had to be honest with myself. one, i didn’t like to go– i didn’t like going to church every week, you know? i just didn’t. part of it was i’m lazy. i don’t like getting up on sundays, and the other part was i already heard all the stories, okay? heard them three, four times, the dude hasn’t come back yet. you know, we’re just sort of mulching over the same shit here, i got it. – right? –  and the other aspect was, you know, i actually– i had to be honest with myself. i felt my religion made sense and everybody else’s sounded stupid.  i did. look, i’m not talking about the basis of every religion. basis of every religion makes sense, you know, the ten commandments. don’t kill anybody. don’t touch my wife. that’s my bike. right? that all makes sense. of which, i’ve broken, i think i’ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one, that’s it. i haven’t killed anybody yet, right? but the murderous thoughts that i have sometimes, i think i could do it. like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers, and they’re wearing those gold-toed, like, dress socks, and they cross their feet at the ankles, and they just start rubbing their feet together. like, i see the whole thing, see the whole thing. wrapping that sock. shh… shh… shh… right? see the whole thing, so we’ll see. still early on, right? but just the stories of how we got here, and where we’re going, and what happens after we die, everybody else’s religion sounded stupid, you know? like, i live out in los angeles, there’s a bunch of scientologists out there, and the first time i heard the story of scientology, i was like, “that is the dumbest shit i have ever heard in my life.”  yeah! like, your guy’s name is ron? ron! and he wasn’t alive thousands of years ago, so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery. this guy was alive, like, 45, 50 years ago. he had a driver’s license, social security number. there’s like footage of him stubbing his toe. “motherfucker!” right? i know what happened. he was working at denny’s, he got sick of it. “i’ll start a religion. hey, everybody, there’s this spaceship coming back. everybody’s getting sneakers. this is tom cruise. we’re gonna try to make you clear, right?” look, i’m paraphrasing, i’m paraphrasing. to be fair to the scientologists, i am paraphrasing, but that’s essentially what they believe in. and i said that is the dumbest shit i ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water, died, and came back three days later. so… yeah. that made total sense to me. so it just hit me one day, i was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesn’t, you know? they got a spaceship in theirs, you know? we– right? we got the space shuttle, you know? there’s sneakers. there’s a lot of shit i can relate to in this. why does that sound so dumb to me? you know what it is? i think it’s ’cause i heard their story when i was an adult. i heard my story when i was four years old, right? when i heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me christmas toys. if i lost a tooth, there was a fairy. there was the easter bunny. why wouldn’t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever he did? of course that made sense. what happened was, as i got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? “ah, son, there is no fat fuck, it’s your mother and i. your mom’s the tooth fairy, rabbits don’t have eggs, her tits are fake, the nba is fixed! bankers are cunts! most of your dreams won’t come true!” right? and i was just like, “wow, this is how the world is.” and meanwhile this shit was just floating, this 800-pound gorilla of this fucking story. i just had to make a decision, what am i gonna do? what am i gonna do with this? am i gonna cling to it, be that person? “that’s very offensive to me and other christians and…” become that douche? all right? and be like the casual christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, “yeah, i kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, i act like i go all the time, and i don’t go anymore.” or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? just let go.  just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. you know. that moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? just let me do this right, just sliding. and you think he’s along for the ride, the two of them, they’re a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking… that rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. that’s what i did with my religion. i just let go of it. i didn’t read a riot act to anybody, i just let go of it. “and on the third day, he rose again in fulfillment of the scriptures…” i just floated away.  so now it’s like, i’m in this weird place where i’m not in any religion right now. unrestricted free agent. you know?  i’d like to believe in something, so i’ve been going around asking people what their shit is, and i haven’t been able to find anything. trying to be open-minded. i was doing a gig in helsinki, and over there, they’re, like, lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, you’re dead and that’s it. dead, like a pigeon, just– just layin’ there. over. blew my mind, i’m like, “really? you’re just dead?” like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? god pops in the dvd of your life. “well, i don’t know about this right here. mind explaining yourself?” this might be the most arrogant thing i say all night, but i actually resent the fact that i’m gonna get judged someday. like, if that’s true, that somebody’s gonna judge me, that doesn’t even make any sense. it’s like, dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. all right? let’s not try to turn this around on me. you know? jesus christ. you give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don’t think this thing’s gonna go off the rails? like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question… your own goddamn work. dude, if i made a car, if i built a car and it didn’t run, i wouldn’t burn it forever. “you evil piece of shit!” just light it on fire. i wouldn’t, i would troubleshoot. is there gas in the engine? is the battery charged? “anything beyond this, i got to get a real man to look at it, but i believe in you. i’m gonna try and help you out.” yes, my religion, it’s nuts. it’s fucking nuts. like, my religion, like, the way i was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldn’t, or some of your friends. doesn’t even make sense. like how am i supposed to enjoy heaven if that’s the deal, right? just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, “jesus christ, where the hell are they? it’s been, like, 150 years! they must have ate a lot of brussels sprouts or some shit! doing some yoga, right?” and then one day, it just settles in that they didn’t make it. and then what, i’m still gonna enjoy heaven, right? jesus coming walking over: “hey, how is it going, everybody? isn’t this great? isn’t this great?” “yeah, dude, it’d be even better if all my family members and friends weren’t burning for fucking ever! kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, j-star, what do you think? hey, dude, i didn’t ask you to come over. you came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. ‘hey, hey, how is it going over here?’ why did you come over here? i don’t give a damn. dude, tell your dad. i don’t give a fuck! i’m already in here, i’m already in here. what, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? go fuck yourself. i knew he was gonna be like that, i knew it. the boss’s son is the worst. fucking sense of entitlement.” so yeah, so they believe when you die, you’re dead. and i was like, so you’re just dead. like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? i couldn’t get my head around it. he goes, “well, like before, when you were born, do you remember that?” and i was like, “no,” and the guy’s like, “yeah, it’s just like that.” i’m like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. dude, i got to be honest, i hate how scared i’m getting as i get older. i’m developing all these new fears. like, i have a fear of flying now. i never had a fear of it. it’s not straight-across-the-board flying. i don’t like small planes all of a sudden. i just don’t like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. i believe in the planes, okay? i just don’t believe in the pilots. ‘cause you know what? i don’t think the airline does, either. which is why that dude is flying that little plane. the airline was basically, like, “all right, we’ll give you, like, 28 people. see how you do, you know? you fly them up, you land, you bring another 28 back. we’ll let you do this for a while. you do this for a while, we don’t get any complaints, no up and down, up and down, none of that shit, we’ll move you up to 35 people. and then one day, you’ll be in a jet–” whoo! we’re going a little faster. right? big planes, you’re getting the fuckin’ pilot that knows what he’s doing. he’s probably fought in a war. he’s used to getting shot at. he can’t bring this bus in? it’s a joke. right? a bunch of people whining in the back, “my headphones don’t work!” he doesn’t give a fuck, right? he’s up there sleeping. he’s trying to make something happen, he’s so goddamn bored. that’s a stud up there, right? so one time i’m flying into albany, new york, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. so i’m on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. all of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence.  and it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like…  all of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. you can literally hear the metal the plane’s made of, like… all of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. “whoa! whaaa! whoa! whaaaa! whoa!” i’m not gonna lie, i have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. but turn around and see a 37-year-old mustachioed male going… “whoo! whaaa! whoa!” dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. i’m praying to a higher power, i don’t even believe in the shit! i just wish i had the balls to turn around and be like, “dude, would you shut the fuck up? jesus christ, be a man, push it down. push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. do some man shit right now. do some man shit.” jesus christ. you know? “you think i’m not up here thinking… ‘whaaa! whoa!’ i am! but how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house?” you know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half… whooo… whaaaa… fucking kids. and you know what? we become weaker as a species. we do.  do you remember back in the day when you watched the discovery channel about animals? now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? now it’s all car stuff. “looking forward to getting that carburetor today. the carburetor didn’t fit.” “what do you mean the carburetor doesn’t fit? dad’s gonna be mad.”  there’s never enough time to build the car. it’s so fucking stupid. “we got to have this bus done by thursday!” or else what? the guy doesn’t want it anymore? all right. “you’ll get the thing when we finish it, okay? this is a safety issue. you want brakes on it? then go get yourself some fucking lunch.” so, before…  before there used to just be animals, and this is what i noticed: everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? if you had one drop of… whoo… whaaa… bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. that was it, your life was over. your life was over. no ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, ’cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. they’re like, “all right, stay away from that one. stay away from that one. he’s gonna jeopardize the whole hill. and, stacy, listen to me.” human beings have empathy. some woman will fall in love. “well, he’s nice. he wears a sweater. he likes to bake, you know? he lets me finish my stories.” which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, you’re rolling the dice. you’re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, ’cause god forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, who’s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. and you’re gonna turn around. all you’re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. i don’t know, man, that’s risky. you know, in reality, i’m being too hard on that guy. yeah, i am. i am, ’cause i was just as scared as he was. except i didn’t scream out like he did, and that’s simple. the simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. having people going, “how was your day? what’s wrong?” and all of that shit, you know? that’s why i came down here. i came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. you are ruining this country. now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that you’re a good man, and to find another man like you. you got to do that. but your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock ’em down, right? “come on, it didn’t hurt, get up!” i didn’t come from a family, i don’t know about you guys, i didn’t come from a touchy-feely… “call me when you get there. mwah, mwah.” none of that shit. first time my mom hugged me, i think, was like, once when i was little, and when i moved out. that was it! and we only hugged ’cause we knew we were supposed to. so we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. it was horrific. fucking horrific. to this day, sometimes i drive down the street, and i think about that hug, and it’s just so awful i have to like shout the memory out of my head. i’ll just be driving down the street, just be like… aaaaah! anybody else like that? you ever have to shout stuff out of your head? there’s something about me, like, all my regret comes up when i’m in the shower. i don’t know what it is. i think ’cause i’m in the shower, and i have time to think, and i’ll just think of shit i did in third grade where i just made an ass of myself, and i’ll just be in the shower just being like…  and my wife’s always just like, “is everything okay in there?” i’ll just be like, “yeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. turned it on too much.” “every day?” so… yeah… i actually asked my mother one time when i finally got out in the world, and i saw how other families interacted, i finally asked her, “how come we never did the hugging thing? how come we didn’t do that stuff?” she was like, “i wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but i was afraid it was gonna make you gay.” and i was like, “you were afraid?” and she goes, “well, it was your father. that’s what it was. protecting him like i always do. he was afraid. he said, you don’t know how to raise boys and if you hug them, that’s what’s gonna happen. so in a marriage, there’s compromises.” yeah, so she basically never hugged us, ’cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. and i got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. let me finish before you start blogging, okay? and i end up on a split screen on good morning atlanta. “comedy, could it go too far? last night at the tabernacle–” sitting there next to some fucking cheeto-eating blogger. so, yeah, this is the deal. i’m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid. as far as i know. i don’t have any kids. as far as i’d think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? you want to improve on your childhood, okay? you want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn’t work. so that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesn’t talk about going to war. so i figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, “don’t change his shitty diaper. let him figure it out for himself. get out in the rain, you shitty baby! hey, let me handle this, lady! why are you still standing here, you shit toddler?” so he took it from that… and knocked it down to, “don’t hug him, it’s gonna make him gay.” right? and then maybe someday i ever have a kid, i’ll whittle it down to like, “he’s not taking drama class, all right? he’s not taking drama class ’cause i said so, lady! let me handle this!” i won’t fix everything. and that’s not a homophobic thing either, that i wouldn’t send my hypothetical son to drama class. okay? it isn’t. i would send… i’d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. okay. my son can’t fucking do any of that shit unless i’m sending him to one of those fame high schools where everybody’s doing it, one of those creative schools. you go to the cafeteria, everybody’s like, ~ cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ then he can do all he wants. then he can do all the fuck he wants, but there’s no way i’m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! he’s gonna get the shit kicked out of him! he’s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then i have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, “there’s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here!” i don’t want to do that. i want to find the fucking eight-year-old. what is he, this tall? i want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. you wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he’s down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. “you ever do that again, i’m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog.” all right?  over. so yeah, a lot in my life has changed since i last came through here to atlanta. i got married. that’s the big thing. yes, i did. very happy about that. i’m very happy because it was starting to get weird. it’s like 45 years old. “my girlfriend, yeah, we’re gonna go out and get some pop.” going to parties, it was just weird. ‘cause i hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. i just couldn’t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage… marriages and kids. i felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, “the superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the middle eastern crisis, it’s just…” “it’s an advanced learning program. the deadline is may 11th. we have to stop the bullying…” “…with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate.” when the conversation would come around to me, i felt like i was eight years old. i’d just be like, “did anybody see the youtube video where the raccoon stole the cat’s food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn’t care? he just came in like this, like george foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. all of a sudden, he had hands. i didn’t know they had hands. he scooped it up and he ran away on paws. did you guys know they had hands?” so now i’m married, so the next move is you’re supposed to have a kid, which i would love to do, but i’m 46 years old. i’m just thinking it’s too fucking late, ya know. come on, man, i’m gonna have a kid, i’m gonna die of natural causes when the kid’s in fifth grade. throwing him a frisbee. “we used to use these on a saturday.” do a face plant. my kid’s standing there, “mom, dad’s sleeping again!” i feel hopelessly behind. all my friends have kids. most of my friends who have kids are cool, but i got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that i don’t understand anything anymore. you know those people? the most basic shit. “hey, man, it’s kind of cold out today.” “dude, you don’t understand. you don’t understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and you’re trying to get chocolate off the other one’s face.” “all right, all right, i get it, you have a more complex life, but i still understand being cold, teeth chattering. kind of lets me know. right?” “mine just turned six.” “mine just turned seven.” i just feel hopelessly behind. so what i’m actually thinking of doing, i’m thinking about adopting. yeah. absolutely, recycle. you know? think globally, act locally. everything doesn’t have to be brand-new. you know? it’s like when you redo your kitchen. you got custom up top, you got ikea down the bottom, right? i’d love to adopt. it’s a great thing to do. but if i do it, i’m not telling any of my friends. i’m just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss ’em off. “mine just turned six.” “mine just turned seven.” i’d love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, “dominoes! yeah, now i get to tell you what you don’t understand. seven-year-old? wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. terrible twos? try the instant eights! bam! they’re just there, like…! with all their issues…!” i should do it, though. i should adopt. i think it’s a great thing to do, and i already know what i want to get. i do. i want to get, like, an ’07, ’08… always garaged, good dentition. do you know what i would love to do? i’d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. wouldn’t that be amazing? like, find the kid that made this shirt? just show up at the factory like, hey! “come on, bring it in! bring it in, you little maniac! how you doing? you’re going back to the states. l-shaped couch, flat screen tv. get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, you’re coming home with me!” yeah. dude, how easy… how easy would that kid be to raise? after the hell he’s been through, all i gotta do is let him sit down. i am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. just bring him home. “have a seat.” he’ll be like, “i get to sit down?” “yeah, lay down on the couch.” he’ll be like, “it’s like a cloud! it’s like a cloud!” i’ll get him a bowl of fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop sports. i don’t know. the kid would love me. so that’s my first draft pick. all right? coming out of the gate with that. in the second round, i’d probably get like an ’05 boy soldier, ya know. yeah, shore up the offensive line. you gotta protect the blindside. that’s how fucked up the world is, there’s little boys out there fighting in wars. so that’s a twofer. i can drag him out of that hell, give him something of what’s left of his childhood, and, god forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? shit goes south, zombies take over, i got backup. everybody thinks i’m gonna be the problem, meanwhile, i got this sawed-off chuck norris… standing next to me, 170 kills, confirmed fucking kills. they’re not stories! can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. you can’t coach that, right? i got to be honest with you, i feel like i’d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. i might be nuts, but i feel like i could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? “i said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. i’m getting sick of this shit! goes for you too if you want. but you! you’ve been out of line all day, mister! don’t even start that shit! don’t even start that shit. you say that every time. yes, you do. every fucking time you say that. you know the answer. you want me to say it again? i’ll break it down to you. you know why it is? you want to know why? ‘cause you sew. all right? yeah. you sew. dude, he’s fucking killed people. do you understand that? no, he doesn’t, he doesn’t have to make his bed too. no, he doesn’t. because he doesn’t sleep in the bed, he’s out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? oh, fuck you, fuck you! he scares me too, he scares me too. don’t even start that shit. you wanted a big brother, and i got you one. don’t even start that shit, all right? all right, you’re right. stop crying, stop crying. shouldn’t have yelled at you. i just thought i could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of pop tarts, i figured he’d chill out. fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that full metal jacket shit. no, you can’t give him back, it doesn’t work that way. there he is, there he is! what’s up, buddy? what’s going on? we were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. you feeling all right? you feeling all right? you’re not looking through those eyebrows, huh? everything okay?” so i figure, uh… i don’t know if i’ll do it. maybe i’m too selfish. i have no idea. i’m all over the fuckin’ map. do you know what i want to do right now? i actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. i do, that’s my latest thing. you know why it is? it’s ’cause i live in los angeles. yeah, and it’s an absolute clusterfuck. when you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. there’s not even zoning laws. they’ll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then there’s, like, a fucking daycare center. right? the city doesn’t even work even when everything else works, so god forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? see, you guys are all right out here in atlanta. you’re all right. i don’t know, maybe in atlanta might be crazy. you’re on the outskirts, you’re fine. you’re fine. you don’t live in a desert. you slam your face in a birdbath, you’re cool. drink that water for a good 30 days. l.a., there’s nowhere to go. that’s why i love the helicopter. dude, the helicopter is the ultimate “fuck this, i’m out” vehicle. all you gotta do is assess the situation. zombie coming up the street? “fuck this! this looks safe.” you just land it. you could sit there hovering. just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. yeah, so i told my wife i want to fly a helicopter. she’s just like, “yeah, no.” which i know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. just that she said that shit, then i was just gonna be like, “oh, all right. thought i was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so… there goes that. hey, what other dreams aren’t i gonna get to achieve? like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask?” yeah, i’m still gonna do it, i’m just not gonna tell her. i’m just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when i get my license, i’m not going to tell her. i’m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. she’s just gonna be like, “what is that? what is that for? what does that mean?” “yeah, someday you’ll see, someday you’ll see. when the shit hits the fan, and you’re freaking the fuck out, and i’m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter.” “what is that?” “shut the fuck up and get in!” now you guys think i’m bullshitting, i’m not. i’m serious. i’m 100% in on this. and ever since i got into it, i’m seeing helicopters everywhere. i never realized how many helicopters there were. driving down the street like henry hill looking up at them… doing key bumps and shit. “they’re after me! swear to god!” i’m seeing stories about them! it’s just like that old advertising anecdote. “i never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until i needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, they’re all over the place. and then i bought a mattress and then it all went away.” it’s the same shit. i saw this story down in orange county. right? down in orange county, california. this guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years– 30 years without incident. hands the business off to his son, the american dream. “i built it up for 30 years. here you go, son. make the family and the family name proud.” “all right, dad, i love you.” all right? this poor kid, five days in, he’s supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. the kid thought it was weird, but he’s like, “i need the money. i gotta give him a tour.” right? so he takes this guy up. ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. yeah, five days in. five days in from the balloons and the cake. “we love you, son. keep the family tree going. the traditional line.” five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. just sitting there, flying the helicopter. “all right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, that’s orange county. there’s over 27 miles of beaches there. put your seatbelt back on, 27 miles of beaches. was established as a county in 1903. sir, please don’t open the door. sir, what are you doing? sir, no, no. don’t, don’t, stop, no, no! what the fuck? what the fuck? oh, my god. oh, my god. oh, my god. what the fuck, what the fuck?! fuck!” air traffic control: “i don’t know who’s on this frequency, but you really need–” “somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter!” five days in. so i read further into the story. turns out the guy who jumped out, he was 61 years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. they couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. at that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. know what i love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didn’t go out like some pussy, right? handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that nana made. fuck that. guy went out like a man. “take me up in a chopper, i’m looking at the land i love, and then i’m jumping out like a superhero.” i loved it. yeah.  this guy should have been wearing a fucking cape. i can’t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life, like, “fuck you, disease. i decide.” ripping tubes out, gets a burger, shotguns a beer. “take me up in the chopper.” he probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard. he’s not even listening to this guy giving the tour. right? “over 27 miles of beaches, put your seatbelt back on. established as a county in 1903. sir, please don’t try to open the door. no, no, don’t, don’t, don’t!”   incredible! but here’s the thing. i left out one small thing. there is one small thing. the guy fucking lived. yeah. yeah, they were out over the ocean, 500 feet up. you’d think that would be enough so, i’m thinking he must have gone in like greg louganis, like, no splash, just… but witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air. so that sounds like a hell of an impact. i think he accidentally did the most epic 500-foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter. but that didn’t change what he was trying to do. where his heart was, i still love this guy. i just feel bad for him. on the way down, he’s got to be thinking, “three more seconds of pain! two more seconds!” wham!  “oh, my god, this is worse! this is way worse!” it has a happy ending, though. he later died at the hospital. that’s right. so here’s to him. god bless him. i hope i have the balls someday. so where do you go from there? well, as i mentioned, last time i came through town, i wanted to get a gun. you know? i do. yeah. but i’ve finally given up on that. i gave up on that dream. my wife doesn’t want me to get one, so. yeah, she didn’t want– dude, you got to pick your fucking battles. i’m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly, i can’t fucking have some .357 hanging around. “i’ll do whatever i want. all right? what i say goes! eat it!” can’t be that person. now it fucking bums me out, ’cause all i wanted to do was just get a .22, that’s all i wanted. perfect gun for home protection, .22 caliber. you’re laughing at that, sir? that’s not enough? i don’t know. i’m down south. what do you think? that’s not enough, right? you want– shotgun, right? .44? you guys are out of your minds. you’re out of your fucking minds. let me ask all you gun guys, who are gonna make fun if i had a .22. “what’s with your .22? that little queer gun. do you keep it between your buttocks? is that the holster? is that what you do with your gay little gun? you need a big gun.” all you fucking guys. let me ask you this, all you guys with your guns… have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs? have you ever done that? or you’re like most people, you take it down to the gun range, you put your earplugs in, put your headset on, take it out of the briefcase. you got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses, right? you look at your spread or whatever, and then you put it back in there, right? you ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs? ‘cause that’s what’s gonna happen when that intruder comes in. you’re not gonna have time to be, “hang on a second, let me just…” yeah, you’re not gonna have time. dude, i shot a five-shot .38 one time without earplugs. i was landscaping this guy’s yard. he comes out at the end of the job. “hey, i got this five-shot .38. you want to go down the street? there’s a burned-out car. we can take a couple of shots.” you know what’s funny? every other state is fuckin’ dying laughing at this point in the joke because it’s so goddamn ridiculous, until i get down to the south. and you guys just sit here staring at me like, “all right, so what happened? pretty standard, i thought this was gonna be a comedy show. you’re reading from your journal? i don’t understand what the– it’s not a real compelling story.” i’m mowing a fucking lawn, and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says, “let’s shoot it at a burned-out car!” okay? jesus christ, can we agree on that? so i’m like, all right, let’s do it, fuck it. so i go down there. never shot a gun before. i bring the gun up, point it at the car, i pull the trigger. i saw the muzzle flash, i felt a kick, i never heard the gun. i pulled the trigger, all i just heard was…  i shot the gun four more times. never heard it. didn’t get louder, didn’t get quieter. just kept seeing flashes.  all right? so let’s take one of your fucking guns. let’s just say, for the sake of argument. all right, you got that thing sitting on a nightstand, loaded. right? for god’s sakes, tell me you have it there. don’t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there. you got the thing fucking loaded, ready to go. 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, this is when the psycho’s coming in too, right? that’s when they come in, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. they don’t come by at 6:30 at night, as you’re cutting into a pork chop. “i’m out of my mind, i’m coming back in 20 minutes, so stretch out your hammies ’cause it’s gonna get crazy.” that’s not how it works. they wait till you’re dead asleep, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, right before rem sleep is kicking in. so let’s just say for the sake of argument, all you gun guys, you got your thing loaded, right? your piece, right? right there, loaded for bear. you’re lying there, same scenario, right? one leg under the covers, one without. shirt. 4:00 in the morning, you’re just…  meanwhile, some psycho, sneaking in through the living room window, right? he brings in a fucking sickle. and he’s just listening. listens all the way down that hall and he just hears…  he’s trying not to squeak on the floorboards. and you’re just fucking lying there.  all of a sudden, that little dog on the floor is just like…   “what’s the matter? what’s the matter? what’s the matter? what’s the matter, boy? you hear something? what’s the matter? what are you barking for? you’re shaking. what’s the matter, huh? you hear something? what’s–? come on, man, quit fucking around. i got to go to work tomorrow.”  all of a sudden, boom! that door flies open. you just see this shadowy figure. you pick up that gun. blam!  and you fucking miss! you miss! you can’t see, now you can’t hear. that’s two out of five senses! what, are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed? you’re still gonna be shooting over here. meanwhile, you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed. takes off your head. if you had the .22, you could still hear. your ears would be ringing, but you could hear that fucker coming across, and you could shoot at him, and he would leave. he would leave. you guys just won’t get off the fact that it’s a fuckin’ .22. you’re, like, psychotic with this shit. all right. no, no, no, no, no, no, no. let me– i will extend an olive branch to you people, okay? i get it. i get it that a .22 is basically a ‘roided-up bb gun. i got it, okay? i understand that if you actually want to kill somebody, you have to basically have the gun up to somebody’s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger. i understand that. okay? but i maintain, i don’t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house. i could defend my house with a bb gun. i don’t give a fuck how tough you are. i don’t care. if i started shooting at you with a bb gun, at the very least, you have to go back outside and regroup. that’s a fact. that is a fact. if i caught you in your elbow, that might be the end of your night. “look, i’m coming back, i’m coming back!” i’ve been trying to get along with my wife better. i’m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship. i’m not turning out the pilot light, though. all right? i’m keeping some fight in me. i’m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like, “i guess we’re making holiday cookies.” that dude with the bowed shoulders. “she makes them and then i’m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them. i don’t even think they taste that good, but just–” no, i stand my ground sometimes. sometimes i let it go. you just got to figure it out. we had a fight the other night, she got so mad at me, she was like, “you can just sleep downstairs. you can just sleep downstairs.” i couldn’t believe it. it’s one of the most arrogant things i’ve ever heard in my life. one adult telling another adult where they can sleep. “you can just sleep downstairs.” like i was just gonna sit up in bed, grab a blanket like linus. “all right. hey, where downstairs, by the way? like, over here downstairs, or like more over here? where should i sleep?” it’s like, are you out of your mind? i go, “i’m not sleeping downstairs.” she’s like, “where you gonna sleep, then?” i’m like, “where i always sleep. i will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if i want to! what are you gonna do? i’m bigger than you. i’ll hang onto the covers, try to get me out. no tickling. go ahead!” yeah, i was like, “you don’t tell me where to sleep. i sleep where i want to sleep.” she’s like, “well, you don’t tell me where to sleep.” i’m like, “i’m not the one telling people where to sleep!” it was one of those classic relationship fights. it’s like 2:00 in the morning, you’re both half naked. she’s not wearing a bra, you got half a ball hanging out. “and another thing! no, no, i need to say this! the other day, i felt slighted!” it’s fuckin’ unreal, but what kills me is that there’s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit. yeah, you talk to them, they’ll be, “hey, how’s it been going?” “it’s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch. you know how that is, right?” no, i don’t. i don’t understand. how did you get yourself into that situation? like, what are you afraid of? what is she gonna do if you say no? what, is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table? i understand if you’re dating some woman and she does that ufc mma shit, then you got to sleep where she says to sleep, you got to. she’s gonna come at you. “well, let’s get you in an arm bar.” “all right, all right, all right!” tapping out. or even worse, she chokes you out. you wake up on the couch, like, 11 minutes later. just grab your jacket off the back of the couch. “i fucking hate when she does this. it’s like, it’s not even fair. have a debate like a normal person.” all right? i’m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here, someone who’s actually been sleeping on the couch, okay? so there’s the first fear, out the window. okay, she can’t physically dominate you, so that’s gone. what’s the next fear? she’s gonna cut off the sex. yeah, rub one out. neutralized. it’s the most empty threat there is. do it right in front of her. “join me!” yeah. i’ve never understood that threat. that’s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator, but you got a sandwich in your pocket, a never-ending sandwich, like some biblical shit, like jesus with the fucking bread or whatever. so now what’s the last thing she can do? what can she do now? be moody? you can’t handle that? walk by your tv without looking at you. only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen. who gives a fuck? my wife does that, i just sit there, i just start commentating. “here she comes again, walking by the tv. she really must be mad.” she’s never body-slammed me once, ever. i’m not saying to be a dick. all right? i’m just saying, you got to keep them honest. every once in a while, you got to have a little pushback. “hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.” rest of the shit– i’m learning that about women. you just want to keep them calm. just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? just everything’s cool, everything’s cool, just, “yeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, i’m having a great time. no, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. i am talking to people, i’m talking to people, i am having a good time here.” that’s what you do. you just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. here’s an olive branch i’ve extended to her. it’s basically… we fight a lot over television. i’ve kind of come her way, she’s come my way. she watches a little bit of sports, i occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. which, i don’t care, the nerd’s gonna fuck the cheerleader. i’ll watch it, right? i don’t mind them, it’s an uplifting story. i just don’t like the love scenes in romantic comedies. they creep me out. they’re just so fucking nice. it’s, like, missionary-style. there’s candles. that stupid saxophone music.  it always goes down. like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? ‘cause they can’t show it. they got to make her this one-dimensional, this little angel. they ignore the other 90% of her sexuality. no hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. none of that taboo stuff of a woman’s sexuality. that’s never brought up. that whole “hold me down but let me up, but hold me down. choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. i want to feel your power but i want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to.” that whole fifty shades of rape, whatever the hell that is. yeah. i don’t even pretend to understand it. i remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. i didn’t even know what she was doing. i was just so psyched to be getting laid, i was like… and she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. i didn’t know what she was doing. i thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. and finally, i was just like, “what are you doing?” she says, like, “i don’t know. i just kinda like, ya know. it’s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. why don’t you want to do it? it’ll be fun.” why don’t i want to do it? i don’t think i want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. having the cops show up. “yeah, she’s in here, officer. damndest thing, it was her idea. i swear to god, it was her idea!” yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. the raciest thing they’ll do is every once in a while, they’ll kiss up against a wall. i guess women like walls. i didn’t know that. a lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. “oh, my god, it’s the wall. oh, my god! it’s supporting me, maybe he’ll support me, it’s a metaphor, i love it.” yeah, i saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. i’m like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? but they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. all she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. he was off to the races. i ruined the movie for my wife. i’m like, “that is fucking bullshit! bullshit.” what does the guy have, like, a u-shaped dick? how is he doing anything? is he sticking it in her navel? did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? like, if all she’s gonna do is this, she’s got to bring it up like an offsides call, if that’s what she’s doing. all right? if not, you got to make some adjustments. you just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles.  maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they’re like, “all right, this is ridiculous, okay? my calves are burning, i can’t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. i can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world.” these guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like they’re not heavy. they start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. dude, i’m not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. yeah, you’re heavy. you’re an adult female! jesus christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? when they’re, like, five or six? “get off of me! jesus christ. you’re gonna throw out my back. go jump on your brother.” an adult woman weighs 115 pounds, 120, all the way up to god knows what. and it’s not balanced weight. most of it’s in your thighs and in your ass. your head’s hanging off trying to counterbalance. dude, when guys go to the gym, we don’t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck-80 over here. “fuckin’ yeah!” yeah, it’s ridiculous. trying to carry a naked woman, it’s like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. you’re, like, bumping into shit. when you see the bed, you don’t walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibe’s ruined, and you’re back to your sandwich in your pocket. all right, i’m out of time. you guys were awesome. thank you so much. thank you, thank you. i had a great time. i’ll see you next time. thank you.  what a wanker not funny at all just fucking screaming  shit like dribble running down his chin.  yawn bill burr is a comedic genius!  he has the courage to make people laugh at some very serious issues in life, by identifying that the issues can be perceived in a different context, one that is much more realistic than people would think.  his parody of catholicism and christianity, and how god and jesus might actually be thinking or feeling helped me truly lighten up and ended up changing my reactions, behavior and feelings about being judged and judging others and myself.  anyway, any deed that results in people feeling more understanding and tolerant and less judgmental is a blessing.  don’t let yourself get caught up in a stereotype when perceiving something as you believe others expect you to do.  the truth shall set you free.\n",

sense of humor here have a beer go fuck yourself that’s what we’re doing” she takes a picture of it puts it on facebook all of a sudden people start complaining they fired the manager and the waitress

80yearold white guy that wasn’t that bad all right dude he didn’t drop the “n” word once that’s unbelievable for an 80yearold white guy the “n” word should have been carpetbombed through that whole tape he never said it once if you go back and listen to that tape– go back and listen to it other than instagram he’s pretty fucking liberal he’s like “you can hang out with them you can have sex with them just don’t promote it on instagram” yeah it was the weirdest most compartmentalized like racism i ever heard in my life something about instagram i didn’t get it other than that he was wide open “you can make a snowman with them go to a water park rub your bellies together just don’t promote it on instagram” “hey what about facebook” “i don’t give a fuck about facebook keep it off of instagram” yeah dude you understand the guy is 80 years old do the math this dude was born in 1934 that’s 13 years before jackie robinson broke the color barrier first 12 and a half years of this

just keep living and living basically i think you got like 25 30 years to absorb as much as you can and then that’s it that’s all you know ‘cause right around then you get married and it’s over right you have a couple of kids you’re sucked in the bubble you don’t have time to pay attention to what’s going on out in the world you’re stuck with these kids “it’s shitting all over the place don’t be a

where’d everybody go i thought i was a good boy” he’s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat i don’t understand i don’t understand why a group like glaad right i always forget it’s gay lesbian a… whatever the fuck it stands for all right why do they go after the old guy in the boat why don’t they go after the people writing the book right “hey could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages” they’re not gonna do that that’s the vatican they’re their own city they got a wall around their own city they’re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it’s nothing they’re not taking that call “oh what happened really go fuck yourself” click they don’t care  i learned a long time ago i think whatever you’re into you’re into but i’m not into that religious stuff where– and this is why i actually walked away from my religion i had to be honest with myself one i didn’t like to go– i didn’t like going to church every week you know i just didn’t part of it was i’m lazy i don’t like getting up on sundays and the other part was i already heard all the stories okay heard them three four times the dude hasn’t come back yet you know we’re just sort of mulching over the same shit here i got it – right –  and the other aspect was you know i actually– i had to be honest with myself i felt my religion made sense and everybody else’s sounded stupid  i did look i’m not talking about the basis of every religion basis of every religion makes sense you know the ten commandments don’t kill anybody don’t touch my wife that’s my bike right that all makes sense of which i’ve broken i think i’ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one that’s it i haven’t killed anybody yet right but the murderous thoughts that i have sometimes i think i could do it like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers and they’re wearing those goldtoed like dress socks and they cross their feet at the ankles and they just start rubbing their feet together like i see the whole thing see the whole thing wrapping that sock shh… shh… shh… right see the whole thing so we’ll see still early on right but just the stories of how we got here and where we’re going and what happens after we die everybody else’s religion sounded stupid you know like i live out in los angeles there’s a bunch of scientologists out there and the first time i heard the story of scientology i was like “that is the dumbest shit i have ever heard in my life”  yeah like your guy’s name is ron ron and he wasn’t alive thousands of years ago so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery this guy was alive like 45 50 years ago he had a driver’s license social security number there’s like footage of him stubbing his toe “motherfucker” right i know what happened he was working at denny’s he got sick of it “i’ll start a religion hey everybody there’s this spaceship coming back everybody’s getting sneakers this is tom cruise we’re gonna try to make you clear right” look i’m paraphrasing i’m paraphrasing to be fair to the scientologists i am paraphrasing but that’s essentially what they believe in and i said that is the dumbest shit i ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water died and came back three days later so… yeah that made total sense to me so it just hit me one day i was like why does that make sense and that shit doesn’t you know they got a spaceship in theirs you know we– right we got the space shuttle you know there’s sneakers there’s a lot of shit i can relate to in this why does that sound so dumb to me you know what it is i think it’s ’cause i heard their story when i was an adult i heard my story when i was four years old right when i heard my story there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney giving me christmas toys if i lost a tooth there was a fairy there was the easter bunny why wouldn’t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever he did of course that made sense what happened was as i got older all of that stuff started to fall right “ah son there is no fat fuck it’s your mother and i your mom’s the tooth fairy rabbits don’t have eggs her tits are fake the nba is fixed bankers are cunts most of your dreams won’t come true” right and i was just like “wow this is how the world is” and meanwhile this shit was just floating this 800pound gorilla of this fucking story i just had to make a decision what am i gonna do what am i gonna do with this am i gonna cling to it be that person “that’s very offensive to me and other christians and…” become that douche all right and be like the casual christian right with like one foot on base just “yeah i kind of go a couple of times a year and like if my parents come to town i act like i go all the time and i don’t go anymore” or my last option which was basically just just let go of the shit you know just let go  just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling you know that moment where the shooter or whatever you call them is just sliding with that rock right just let me do this right just sliding and you think he’s along for the ride the two of them they’re a team and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking… that rock just keeps going this dude just stops that’s what i did with my religion i just let go of it i didn’t read a riot act to anybody i just let go of it “and on the third day he rose again in fulfillment of the scriptures…” i just floated away  so now it’s like i’m in this weird place where i’m not in any religion right now unrestricted free agent you know  i’d like to believe in something so i’ve been going around asking people what their shit is and i haven’t been able to find anything trying to be openminded i was doing a gig in helsinki and over there they’re like lutheran and what they believe they believe when you die you’re dead and that’s it dead like a pigeon just– just layin’ there over blew my mind i’m like “really you’re just dead” like my religion was you die and then you go up to get judged right god pops in the dvd of your life “well i don’t know about this right here mind explaining yourself” this might be the most arrogant thing i say all night but i actually resent the fact that i’m gonna get judged someday like if that’s true that somebody’s gonna judge me that doesn’t even make any sense it’s like dude you made me so this is your fuckup all right let’s not try to turn this around on me you know jesus christ you give me freedom of choice you make whores you have me suck at math and you don’t think this thing’s gonna go off the rails like you set me up to fail and now you got the balls to now question… your own goddamn work dude if i made a car if i built a car and it didn’t run i wouldn’t burn it forever “you evil piece of shit” just light it on fire i wouldn’t i would troubleshoot is there gas in the engine is the battery charged “anything beyond this i got to get a real man to look at it but i believe in you i’m gonna try and help you out” yes my religion it’s nuts it’s fucking nuts like my religion like the way i was brought up is like you know you can make it to heaven but like some of your family members possibly couldn’t or some of your friends doesn’t even make sense like how am i supposed to enjoy heaven if that’s the deal right just sitting here waiting for my friends to show up “jesus christ where the hell are they it’s been like 150 years they must have ate a lot of brussels sprouts or some shit doing some yoga right” and then one day it just settles in that they didn’t make it and then what i’m still gonna enjoy heaven right jesus coming walking over “hey how is it going everybody isn’t this great isn’t this great” “yeah dude it’d be even better if all my family members and friends weren’t burning for fucking ever kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there jstar what do you think hey dude i didn’t ask you to come over you came walking over with your big dumb sandals ‘hey hey how is it going over here’ why did you come over here i don’t give a damn dude tell your dad i don’t give a fuck i’m already in here i’m already in here what are you gonna kick me out afterwards go fuck yourself i knew he was gonna be like that i knew it the boss’s son is the worst fucking sense of entitlement” so yeah so they believe when you die you’re dead and i was like so you’re just dead like how do you wrap your head around not existing i couldn’t get my head around it he goes “well like before when you were born do you remember that” and i was like “no” and the guy’s like “yeah it’s just like that” i’m like not only does that make sense that is absolutely terrifying dude i got to be honest i hate how scared i’m getting as i get older i’m developing all these new fears like i have a fear of flying now i never had a fear of it it’s not straightacrosstheboard flying i don’t like small planes all of a sudden i just don’t like them and it has nothing to do with the plane i believe in the planes okay i just don’t believe in the pilots ‘cause you know what i don’t think the airline does either which is why that dude is flying that little plane the airline was basically like “all right we’ll give you like 28 people see how you do you know you fly them up you land you bring another 28 back we’ll let you do this for a while you do this for a while we don’t get any complaints no up and down up and down none of that shit we’ll move you up to 35 people and then one day you’ll be in a jet–” whoo we’re going a little faster right big planes you’re getting the fuckin’ pilot that knows what he’s doing he’s probably fought in a war he’s used to getting shot at he can’t bring this bus in it’s a joke right a bunch of people whining in the back “my headphones don’t work” he doesn’t give a fuck right he’s up there sleeping he’s trying to make something happen he’s so goddamn bored that’s a stud up there right so one time i’m flying into albany new york okay a city that nobody really goes to so i’m on a smaller plane and everything is going great all of a sudden out of nowhere we hit this turbulence  and it stops and everybody looks around laughing nervously like…  all of a sudden it comes back with a vengeance you can literally hear the metal the plane’s made of like… all of a sudden this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises “whoa whaaa whoa whaaaa whoa” i’m not gonna lie i have never been so fucking scared in my entire life dude that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child but turn around and see a 37yearold mustachioed male going… “whoo whaaa whoa” dude the hair was standing up on my arms i’m praying to a higher power i don’t even believe in the shit i just wish i had the balls to turn around and be like “dude would you shut the fuck up jesus christ be a man push it down push it down deny your feelings act like you have answers do some man shit right now do some man shit” jesus christ you know “you think i’m not up here thinking… ‘whaaa whoa’ i am but how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house” you know what kills me what absolutely kills me is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy marry him and make half… whooo… whaaaa… fucking kids and you know what we become weaker as a species we do  do you remember back in the day when you watched the discovery channel about animals now they build cars but it used to be about animals right now it’s all car stuff “looking forward to getting that carburetor today the carburetor didn’t fit” “what do you mean the carburetor doesn’t fit dad’s gonna be mad”  there’s never enough time to build the car it’s so fucking stupid “we got to have this bus done by thursday” or else what the guy doesn’t want it anymore all right “you’ll get the thing when we finish it okay this is a safety issue you want brakes on it then go get yourself some fucking lunch” so before…  before there used to just be animals and this is what i noticed everything from a lion all the way down to an insect okay if you had one drop of… whoo… whaaa… bitchy blood in you none of the females would fuck you that was it your life was over your life was over no ant pussy for you your entire miserable eightday ant life ’cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew and the female ant saw it they’re like “all right stay away from that one stay away from that one he’s gonna jeopardize the whole hill and stacy listen to me” human beings have empathy some woman will fall in love “well he’s nice he wears a sweater he likes to bake you know he lets me finish my stories” which is all great qualities okay but you got to know when you shack up with a guy like that you’re rolling the dice you’re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over ’cause god forbid he picks your goddamn house this is the dude who has your back who’s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door and you’re gonna turn around all you’re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window i don’t know man that’s risky you know in reality i’m being too hard on that guy yeah i am i am ’cause i was just as scared as he was except i didn’t scream out like he did and that’s simple the simple reason was this dude he was hugged too much as a child having people going “how was your day what’s wrong” and all of that shit you know that’s why i came down here i came out here to tell you guys you got to stop hugging your children you are ruining this country now you can hug your daughters you got to do that you got to do that hug those hooker shoes right out of them let them know that you’re a good man and to find another man like you you got to do that but your son you can hug them a little bit but every three four you got to fucking knock ’em down right “come on it didn’t hurt get up” i didn’t come from a family i don’t know about you guys i didn’t come from a touchyfeely… “call me when you get there mwah mwah” none of that shit first time my mom hugged me i think was like once when i was little and when i moved out that was it and we only hugged ’cause we knew we were supposed to so we just tried to like it was like two parking meters came to life like we almost bumped heads it was horrific fucking horrific to this day sometimes i drive down the street and i think about that hug and it’s just so awful i have to like shout the memory out of my head i’ll just be driving down the street just be like… aaaaah anybody else like that you ever have to shout stuff out of your head there’s something about me like all my regret comes up when i’m in the shower i don’t know what it is i think ’cause i’m in the shower and i have time to think and i’ll just think of shit i did in third grade where i just made an ass of myself and i’ll just be in the shower just being like…  and my wife’s always just like “is everything okay in there” i’ll just be like “yeah yeah just accidentally turned on the hot water turned it on too much” “every day” so… yeah… i actually asked my mother one time when i finally got out in the world and i saw how other families interacted i finally asked her “how come we never did the hugging thing how come we didn’t do that stuff” she was like “i wanted to hug you kids when you were little but i was afraid it was gonna make you gay” and i was like “you were afraid” and she goes “well it was your father that’s what it was protecting him like i always do he was afraid he said you don’t know how to raise boys and if you hug them that’s what’s gonna happen so in a marriage there’s compromises” yeah so she basically never hugged us ’cause my dad said if she did it was gonna make us gay and i got to tell you that was a great thing that my dad did for me let me finish before you start blogging okay and i end up on a split screen on good morning atlanta “comedy could it go too far last night at the tabernacle–” sitting there next to some fucking cheetoeating blogger so yeah this is the deal i’m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid as far as i know i don’t have any kids as far as i’d think if you have a kid what do you want to do you want to improve on your childhood okay you want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn’t work so that was my dad as fucked up as that was that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about the way a veteran doesn’t talk about going to war so i figure if that was his improvement on his childhood his childhood just must have been something like “don’t change his shitty diaper let him figure it out for himself get out in the rain you shitty baby hey let me handle this lady why are you still standing here you shit toddler” so he took it from that… and knocked it down to “don’t hug him it’s gonna make him gay” right and then maybe someday i ever have a kid i’ll whittle it down to like “he’s not taking drama class all right he’s not taking drama class ’cause i said so lady let me handle this” i won’t fix everything and that’s not a homophobic thing either that i wouldn’t send my hypothetical son to drama class okay it isn’t i would send… i’d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class okay my son can’t fucking do any of that shit unless i’m sending him to one of those fame high schools where everybody’s doing it one of those creative schools you go to the cafeteria everybody’s like  cottage cheese what is it made of  then he can do all he wants then he can do all the fuck he wants but there’s no way i’m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals he’s gonna get the shit kicked out of him he’s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass and then i have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like “there’s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here” i don’t want to do that i want to find the fucking eightyearold what is he this tall i want to find the kid that did it to my kid tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue right and just leave him there you wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he’s down to his last breath and then you turn him upsideright and you grab him by his throat you say something horrific “you ever do that again i’m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog” all right  over so yeah a lot in my life has changed since i last came through here to atlanta i got married that’s the big thing yes i did very happy about that i’m very happy because it was starting to get weird it’s like 45 years old “my girlfriend yeah we’re gonna go out and get some pop” going to parties it was just weird ‘cause i hang out with people my age and they all got married they all had kids i just couldn’t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage… marriages and kids i felt like a little kid just sitting there going like “the superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal bipartisan with the middle eastern crisis it’s just…” “it’s an advanced learning program the deadline is may 11th we have to stop the bullying…” “…with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate” when the conversation would come around to me i felt like i was eight years old i’d just be like “did anybody see the youtube video where the raccoon stole the cat’s food and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn’t care he just came in like this like george foreman and then he reached out he had hands all of a sudden he had hands i didn’t know they had hands he scooped it up and he ran away on paws did you guys know they had hands” so now i’m married so the next move is you’re supposed to have a kid which i would love to do but i’m 46 years old i’m just thinking it’s too fucking late ya know come on man i’m gonna have a kid i’m gonna die of natural causes when the kid’s in fifth grade throwing him a frisbee “we used to use these on a saturday” do a face plant my kid’s standing there “mom dad’s sleeping again” i feel hopelessly behind all my friends have kids most of my friends who have kids are cool but i got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid that i don’t understand anything anymore you know those people the most basic shit “hey man it’s kind of cold out today” “dude you don’t understand you don’t understand cold till you got a twoyearold with a mitten up his ass and you’re trying to get chocolate off the other one’s face” “all right all right i get it you have a more complex life but i still understand being cold teeth chattering kind of lets me know right” “mine just turned six” “mine just turned seven” i just feel hopelessly behind so what i’m actually thinking of doing i’m thinking about adopting yeah absolutely recycle you know think globally act locally everything doesn’t have to be brandnew you know it’s like when you redo your kitchen you got custom up top you got ikea down the bottom right i’d love to adopt it’s a great thing to do but if i do it i’m not telling any of my friends i’m just gonna show up with the kid one day just to piss ’em off “mine just turned six” “mine just turned seven” i’d love to just show up with an eightyearold like “dominoes yeah now i get to tell you what you don’t understand sevenyearold wait till they turn eight eight is such a funny age terrible twos try the instant eights bam they’re just there like… with all their issues…” i should do it though i should adopt i think it’s a great thing to do and i already know what i want to get i do i want to get like an ’07 ’08… always garaged good dentition do you know what i would love to do i’d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop wouldn’t that be amazing like find the kid that made this shirt just show up at the factory like hey “come on bring it in bring it in you little maniac how you doing you’re going back to the states lshaped couch flat screen tv get in the car the rest of you keep sewing but you you’re coming home with me” yeah dude how easy… how easy would that kid be to raise after the hell he’s been through all i gotta do is let him sit down i am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met just bring him home “have a seat” he’ll be like “i get to sit down” “yeah lay down on the couch” he’ll be like “it’s like a cloud it’s like a cloud” i’ll get him a bowl of fritos put on cricket or soccer one of those sweatshop sports i don’t know the kid would love me so that’s my first draft pick all right coming out of the gate with that in the second round i’d probably get like an ’05 boy soldier ya know yeah shore up the offensive line you gotta protect the blindside that’s how fucked up the world is there’s little boys out there fighting in wars so that’s a twofer i can drag him out of that hell give him something of what’s left of his childhood and god forbid if the dollar ever collapses right shit goes south zombies take over i got backup everybody thinks i’m gonna be the problem meanwhile i got this sawedoff chuck norris… standing next to me 170 kills confirmed fucking kills they’re not stories can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster you can’t coach that right i got to be honest with you i feel like i’d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider i might be nuts but i feel like i could come down on the sweatshop kid right “i said get in there and clean up your goddamn room i’m getting sick of this shit goes for you too if you want but you you’ve been out of line all day mister don’t even start that shit don’t even start that shit you say that every time yes you do every fucking time you say that you know the answer you want me to say it again i’ll break it down to you you know why it is you want to know why ‘cause you sew all right yeah you sew dude he’s fucking killed people do you understand that no he doesn’t he doesn’t have to make his bed too no he doesn’t because he doesn’t sleep in the bed he’s out in the bushes all night talking to himself freaking me the fuck out all right oh fuck you fuck you he scares me too he scares me too don’t even start that shit you wanted a big brother and i got you one don’t even start that shit all right all right you’re right stop crying stop crying shouldn’t have yelled at you i just thought i could fucking bring him in give him a couple of pop tarts i figured he’d chill out fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows doing that full metal jacket shit no you can’t give him back it doesn’t work that way there he is there he is what’s up buddy what’s going on we were just talking about you just doing like a little surprise thing you feeling all right you feeling all right you’re not looking through those eyebrows huh everything okay” so i figure uh… i don’t know if i’ll do it maybe i’m too selfish i have no idea i’m all over the fuckin’ map do you know what i want to do right now i actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter man i do that’s my latest thing you know why it is it’s ’cause i live in los angeles yeah and it’s an absolute clusterfuck when you go into land in that city just look out the window and just look at the complete lack of planning there’s not even zoning laws they’ll build like a skyscraper next to a house next to a gun range and then there’s like a fucking daycare center right the city doesn’t even work even when everything else works so god forbid the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens where you gonna go in a city like that see you guys are all right out here in atlanta you’re all right i don’t know maybe in atlanta might be crazy you’re on the outskirts you’re fine you’re fine you don’t live in a desert you slam your face in a birdbath you’re cool drink that water for a good 30 days la there’s nowhere to go that’s why i love the helicopter dude the helicopter is the ultimate “fuck this i’m out” vehicle all you gotta do is assess the situation zombie coming up the street “fuck this this looks safe” you just land it you could sit there hovering just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick yeah so i told my wife i want to fly a helicopter she’s just like “yeah no” which i know that came from a place of love but it still kind of annoyed me just that she said that shit then i was just gonna be like “oh all right thought i was gonna get to do that but you said no so… there goes that hey what other dreams aren’t i gonna get to achieve like do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask” yeah i’m still gonna do it i’m just not gonna tell her i’m just gonna go out and do it pass the goddamn class and when i get my license i’m not going to tell her i’m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf and hang it by a nail in the living room she’s just gonna be like “what is that what is that for what does that mean” “yeah someday you’ll see someday you’ll see when the shit hits the fan and you’re freaking the fuck out and i’m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter” “what is that” “shut the fuck up and get in” now you guys think i’m bullshitting i’m not i’m serious i’m 100 in on this and ever since i got into it i’m seeing helicopters everywhere i never realized how many helicopters there were driving down the street like henry hill looking up at them… doing key bumps and shit “they’re after me swear to god” i’m seeing stories about them it’s just like that old advertising anecdote “i never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until i needed a mattress and then all of a sudden they’re all over the place and then i bought a mattress and then it all went away” it’s the same shit i saw this story down in orange county right down in orange county california this guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years– 30 years without incident hands the business off to his son the american dream “i built it up for 30 years here you go son make the family and the family name proud” “all right dad i love you” all right this poor kid five days in he’s supposed to give a tour to a couple only the dude shows up the kid thought it was weird but he’s like “i need the money i gotta give him a tour” right so he takes this guy up ten minutes into the tour the dude fucking jumped out yeah five days in five days in from the balloons and the cake “we love you son keep the family tree going the traditional line” five fucking days later this kid he probably barely had the speech down just sitting there flying the helicopter “all right if you look out the left side of the aircraft that’s orange county there’s over 27 miles of beaches there put your seatbelt back on 27 miles of beaches was established as a county in 1903 sir please don’t open the door sir what are you doing sir no no don’t don’t stop no no what the fuck what the fuck oh my god oh my god oh my god what the fuck what the fuck fuck” air traffic control “i don’t know who’s on this frequency but you really need–” “somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter” five days in so i read further into the story turns out the guy who jumped out he was 61 years old terminally ill he was in pain every day they couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him and he had had enough at that point that guy immediately became a hero in my world know what i love about him not only did he make the decision he didn’t go out like some pussy right handful of pills watching a romantic comedy wrapped in an afghan that nana made fuck that guy went out like a man “take me up in a chopper i’m looking at the land i love and then i’m jumping out like a superhero” i loved it yeah  this guy should have been wearing a fucking cape i can’t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life like “fuck you disease i decide” ripping tubes out gets a burger shotguns a beer “take me up in the chopper” he probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard he’s not even listening to this guy giving the tour right “over 27 miles of beaches put your seatbelt back on established as a county in 1903 sir please don’t try to open the door no no don’t don’t don’t”   incredible but here’s the thing i left out one small thing there is one small thing the guy fucking lived yeah yeah they were out over the ocean 500 feet up you’d think that would be enough so i’m thinking he must have gone in like greg louganis like no splash just… but witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air so that sounds like a hell of an impact i think he accidentally did the most epic 500foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter but that didn’t change what he was trying to do where his heart was i still love this guy i just feel bad for him on the way down he’s got to be thinking “three more seconds of pain two more seconds” wham  “oh my god this is worse this is way worse” it has a happy ending though he later died at the hospital that’s right so here’s to him god bless him i hope i have the balls someday so where do you go from there well as i mentioned last time i came through town i wanted to get a gun you know i do yeah but i’ve finally given up on that i gave up on that dream my wife doesn’t want me to get one so yeah she didn’t want– dude you got to pick your fucking battles i’m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly i can’t fucking have some 357 hanging around “i’ll do whatever i want all right what i say goes eat it” can’t be that person now it fucking bums me out ’cause all i wanted to do was just get a 22 that’s all i wanted perfect gun for home protection 22 caliber you’re laughing at that sir that’s not enough i don’t know i’m down south what do you think that’s not enough right you want– shotgun right 44 you guys are out of your minds you’re out of your fucking minds let me ask all you gun guys who are gonna make fun if i had a 22 “what’s with your 22 that little queer gun do you keep it between your buttocks is that the holster is that what you do with your gay little gun you need a big gun” all you fucking guys let me ask you this all you guys with your guns… have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs have you ever done that or you’re like most people you take it down to the gun range you put your earplugs in put your headset on take it out of the briefcase you got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses right you look at your spread or whatever and then you put it back in there right you ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs ‘cause that’s what’s gonna happen when that intruder comes in you’re not gonna have time to be “hang on a second let me just…” yeah you’re not gonna have time dude i shot a fiveshot 38 one time without earplugs i was landscaping this guy’s yard he comes out at the end of the job “hey i got this fiveshot 38 you want to go down the street there’s a burnedout car we can take a couple of shots” you know what’s funny every other state is fuckin’ dying laughing at this point in the joke because it’s so goddamn ridiculous until i get down to the south and you guys just sit here staring at me like “all right so what happened pretty standard i thought this was gonna be a comedy show you’re reading from your journal i don’t understand what the– it’s not a real compelling story” i’m mowing a fucking lawn and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says “let’s shoot it at a burnedout car” okay jesus christ can we agree on that so i’m like all right let’s do it fuck it so i go down there never shot a gun before i bring the gun up point it at the car i pull the trigger i saw the muzzle flash i felt a kick i never heard the gun i pulled the trigger all i just heard was…  i shot the gun four more times never heard it didn’t get louder didn’t get quieter just kept seeing flashes  all right so let’s take one of your fucking guns let’s just say for the sake of argument all right you got that thing sitting on a nightstand loaded right for god’s sakes tell me you have it there don’t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there you got the thing fucking loaded ready to go 300 400 in the morning this is when the psycho’s coming in too right that’s when they come in 300 400 in the morning they don’t come by at 630 at night as you’re cutting into a pork chop “i’m out of my mind i’m coming back in 20 minutes so stretch out your hammies ’cause it’s gonna get crazy” that’s not how it works they wait till you’re dead asleep 300 400 in the morning right before rem sleep is kicking in so let’s just say for the sake of argument all you gun guys you got your thing loaded right your piece right right there loaded for bear you’re lying there same scenario right one leg under the covers one without shirt 400 in the morning you’re just…  meanwhile some psycho sneaking in through the living room window right he brings in a fucking sickle and he’s just listening listens all the way down that hall and he just hears…  he’s trying not to squeak on the floorboards and you’re just fucking lying there  all of a sudden that little dog on the floor is just like…   “what’s the matter what’s the matter what’s the matter what’s the matter boy you hear something what’s the matter what are you barking for you’re shaking what’s the matter huh you hear something what’s– come on man quit fucking around i got to go to work tomorrow”  all of a sudden boom that door flies open you just see this shadowy figure you pick up that gun blam  and you fucking miss you miss you can’t see now you can’t hear that’s two out of five senses what are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed you’re still gonna be shooting over here meanwhile you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed takes off your head if you had the 22 you could still hear your ears would be ringing but you could hear that fucker coming across and you could shoot at him and he would leave he would leave you guys just won’t get off the fact that it’s a fuckin’ 22 you’re like psychotic with this shit all right no no no no no no no let me– i will extend an olive branch to you people okay i get it i get it that a 22 is basically a ‘roidedup bb gun i got it okay i understand that if you actually want to kill somebody you have to basically have the gun up to somebody’s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger i understand that okay but i maintain i don’t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house i could defend my house with a bb gun i don’t give a fuck how tough you are i don’t care if i started shooting at you with a bb gun at the very least you have to go back outside and regroup that’s a fact that is a fact if i caught you in your elbow that might be the end of your night “look i’m coming back i’m coming back” i’ve been trying to get along with my wife better i’m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship i’m not turning out the pilot light though all right i’m keeping some fight in me i’m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like “i guess we’re making holiday cookies” that dude with the bowed shoulders “she makes them and then i’m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them i don’t even think they taste that good but just–” no i stand my ground sometimes sometimes i let it go you just got to figure it out we had a fight the other night she got so mad at me she was like “you can just sleep downstairs you can just sleep downstairs” i couldn’t believe it it’s one of the most arrogant things i’ve ever heard in my life one adult telling another adult where they can sleep “you can just sleep downstairs” like i was just gonna sit up in bed grab a blanket like linus “all right hey where downstairs by the way like over here downstairs or like more over here where should i sleep” it’s like are you out of your mind i go “i’m not sleeping downstairs” she’s like “where you gonna sleep then” i’m like “where i always sleep i will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if i want to what are you gonna do i’m bigger than you i’ll hang onto the covers try to get me out no tickling go ahead” yeah i was like “you don’t tell me where to sleep i sleep where i want to sleep” she’s like “well you don’t tell me where to sleep” i’m like “i’m not the one telling people where to sleep” it was one of those classic relationship fights it’s like 200 in the morning you’re both half naked she’s not wearing a bra you got half a ball hanging out “and another thing no no i need to say this the other day i felt slighted” it’s fuckin’ unreal but what kills me is that there’s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit yeah you talk to them they’ll be “hey how’s it been going” “it’s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch you know how that is right” no i don’t i don’t understand how did you get yourself into that situation like what are you afraid of what is she gonna do if you say no what is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table i understand if you’re dating some woman and she does that ufc mma shit then you got to sleep where she says to sleep you got to she’s gonna come at you “well let’s get you in an arm bar” “all right all right all right” tapping out or even worse she chokes you out you wake up on the couch like 11 minutes later just grab your jacket off the back of the couch “i fucking hate when she does this it’s like it’s not even fair have a debate like a normal person” all right i’m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here someone who’s actually been sleeping on the couch okay so there’s the first fear out the window okay she can’t physically dominate you so that’s gone what’s the next fear she’s gonna cut off the sex yeah rub one out neutralized it’s the most empty threat there is do it right in front of her “join me” yeah i’ve never understood that threat that’s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator but you got a sandwich in your pocket a neverending sandwich like some biblical shit like jesus with the fucking bread or whatever so now what’s the last thing she can do what can she do now be moody you can’t handle that walk by your tv without looking at you only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen who gives a fuck my wife does that i just sit there i just start commentating “here she comes again walking by the tv she really must be mad” she’s never bodyslammed me once ever i’m not saying to be a dick all right i’m just saying you got to keep them honest every once in a while you got to have a little pushback “hey hey hey hey hey” rest of the shit– i’m learning that about women you just want to keep them calm just keep them calm like a rescue dog right just everything’s cool everything’s cool just “yeah yeah yeah this is great this is great i’m having a great time no your friends are awesome your friends are awesome very interesting party i am talking to people i’m talking to people i am having a good time here” that’s what you do you just do that enough then when you bark back you got a little something here’s an olive branch i’ve extended to her it’s basically… we fight a lot over television i’ve kind of come her way she’s come my way she watches a little bit of sports i occasionally will watch a romantic comedy which i don’t care the nerd’s gonna fuck the cheerleader i’ll watch it right i don’t mind them it’s an uplifting story i just don’t like the love scenes in romantic comedies they creep me out they’re just so fucking nice it’s like missionarystyle there’s candles that stupid saxophone music  it always goes down like the saxophone implies the penetration right ‘cause they can’t show it they got to make her this onedimensional this little angel they ignore the other 90 of her sexuality no hairpulling no assslapping none of that shit none of that taboo stuff of a woman’s sexuality that’s never brought up that whole “hold me down but let me up but hold me down choke me but let me breathe but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit i want to feel your power but i want to be safe but let me know if you really wanted to” that whole fifty shades of rape whatever the hell that is yeah i don’t even pretend to understand it i remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit i didn’t even know what she was doing i was just so psyched to be getting laid i was like… and she just kept taking my hand and she kept putting it right here i didn’t know what she was doing i thought she was testing my core strength or some shit and finally i was just like “what are you doing” she says like “i don’t know i just kinda like ya know it’s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it why don’t you want to do it it’ll be fun” why don’t i want to do it i don’t think i want a passedout naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck having the cops show up “yeah she’s in here officer damndest thing it was her idea i swear to god it was her idea” yeah they always make it nice in those movies the raciest thing they’ll do is every once in a while they’ll kiss up against a wall i guess women like walls i didn’t know that a lot of upagainstthewall kissing “oh my god it’s the wall oh my god it’s supporting me maybe he’ll support me it’s a metaphor i love it” yeah i saw one the other night they were doing that and then out of nowhere they started having sex up against the wall i’m like finally something a little bit more interesting right but they were doing it standing up facing each other missionarystyle arguably one of the most difficult positions there is and they were doing it with little to no difficulty all she did was lift her leg up like that and that was it he was off to the races i ruined the movie for my wife i’m like “that is fucking bullshit bullshit” what does the guy have like a ushaped dick how is he doing anything is he sticking it in her navel did he grease up her thighs to hell with her needs like if all she’s gonna do is this she’s got to bring it up like an offsides call if that’s what she’s doing all right if not you got to make some adjustments you just got to grab the other leg you got to try to pick her up there use these muscles  maybe you could grab a doorjamb drop down try to come in try to do that dude nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they’re like “all right this is ridiculous okay my calves are burning i can’t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage i can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world” these guys in the movie they have no problem banging away then they pick them up like they’re not heavy they start walking down they see the bed they just lay her down on the bed dude i’m not trying to be a dick but every woman in here is heavy yeah you’re heavy you’re an adult female jesus christ when do you stop picking up your kids when they’re like five or six “get off of me jesus christ you’re gonna throw out my back go jump on your brother” an adult woman weighs 115 pounds 120 all the way up to god knows what and it’s not balanced weight most of it’s in your thighs and in your ass your head’s hanging off trying to counterbalance dude when guys go to the gym we don’t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck80 over here “fuckin’ yeah” yeah it’s ridiculous trying to carry a naked woman it’s like trying to carry a halffilled waterbed mattress you’re like bumping into shit when you see the bed you don’t walk to it you slowly start picking up momentum then she bounces off this mattress hits the wall slides down the whole sex vibe’s ruined and you’re back to your sandwich in your pocket all right i’m out of time you guys were awesome thank you so much thank you thank you i had a great time i’ll see you next time thank you  what a wanker not funny at all just fucking screaming  shit like dribble running down his chin  yawn bill burr is a comedic genius  he has the courage to make people laugh at some very serious issues in life by identifying that the issues can be perceived in a different context one that is much more realistic than people would think  his parody of catholicism and christianity and how god and jesus might actually be thinking or feeling helped me truly lighten up and ended up changing my reactions behavior and feelings about being judged and judging others and myself  anyway any deed that results in people feeling more understanding and tolerant and less judgmental is a blessing  don’t let yourself get caught up in a stereotype when perceiving something as you believe others expect you to do  the truth shall set you free\n",

for the environment you know i guess there’s all this cattle standing around and when they fart the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something right they’re always doing that shit you know “if everybody went vegan the air would be– if everybody drove an electric car if everybody just had some snowshoes on” right they just won’t come out and say it nobody has the balls to come out and just say “look  of you have to go” – that’s it that is it –  i have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row waiting… for some politician to have the balls to bring it up but they won’t do it they won’t do it we live in a democracy right can’t be honest in a democracy you need the votes you can’t run with that as your platform coming out there “and if elected i would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least  of you this planet cannot sustain the sheer numbers– let me finish this will not be arbitrary under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire if you did not bring a pencil you’re already out” you can’t do that you got to be nice you got to be fuckin’ nice especially this day and age everybody getting in trouble all these goddamn groups out there bitch moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything “we’re part of a group eh” you gotta apologize “i’m sorry to people who own shar peis i didn’t mean to say that it’s an uglyass dog

join a group that’s what i’m gonna do today” go to meetings what kind of a fucking loser right that’s the same way i look at people who got upset about you know michael sam the gay football player kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted everybody bitch moaning and complaining it’s like dude that’s what you get for watching the draft all right now once again what kind of a fucking loser just sits there watching round after round “the jets are up next i think they need a quarterback they need to improve their defensive line” dude that’s like going to a graduation ceremony where you don’t know anybody who’s graduating you’re just fucking sitting there they’re gonna have the whole list the next day they’ll have everybody who drafted who when fucking got to sit there and watch that shit those stupid interviews “yeah you’re a member of the buffalo bills how does it feel” “well you know it’s a blessing i want to thank god gonna try to do my best it’s a great organization and the same shit the last  guys said so yeah” yeah i’m glad he kissed him he should have fuckin’ blown him yeah with birthday cake in his mouth and a santa claus hat on his head just to ruin the entire year holding a flag that fucks up flag day you’ll keep thinking about it yeah fucking stupidass groups people apologizing to ’em like they have some sort of power look if you’re being a dick apologize but other than that yeah go fuck yourself yeah  everybody getting in trouble like a bunch of children i was doing a gig in dallas and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard she goes “we like our beer the way we like our violence domestic” right now i got to tell you something that’s a great fucking joke there is zero fat on that you need every word of that joke you take one word out it doesn’t work it’s a perfect joke so whatever nobody gives a shit one person comes in they don’t like it they ask the manager to take it down he’s just like “that’s our sense of humor here have a beer go fuck yourself that’s what we’re doing” she takes a picture of it puts it on facebook all of a sudden people start complaining they fired the manager and the waitress because of that yeah i don’t understand like what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke like you’re some guy who would never hit a woman ya know would never hit a woman you can’t hit women you honestly cannot you ever see how they fall they fall like toddlers you know it’s like they never fell in their life they never put their hands out it’s horrific to watch you can’t hit them right so what are you telling me somebody… you’re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in read that joke you know just be “wait a minute”  that’s the dumbest shit they have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women people still do it what do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home they’re like so focused on hitting their wife they got blinders on they’re not reading anything they don’t see the “don’t hit your wife” billboard they’re still gonna do it did that get too weird for you guys did the church organs make that fucked up like i was up here “make a pledge for jesus and hit your women” ever watch some of those stupid religious shows that fucking joel osteen you ever see that guy that guy is so full of shit he doesn’t even open his eyes when he’s talking “take a pledge for jesus are they still here” he doesn’t even have the nerve to open his eyes “you want some popsicles jesus wants you to have some popsicles he wants you to have those popsicles” his fucking electric blue carpet yeah everybody’s getting in trouble ’cause of these goddamn groups look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year old people get in trouble right that older woman there that makes the cookies on the food network right yeah paula deen she got in trouble ’cause she had this slaverythemed wedding or whatever the hell she did in defense of her you know you want to have an original wedding there’s not a lot of themes left you know you got to use the old imagination if you’re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity right i’m actually gonna have a holocaust themed pool party later on this summer i am “once everyone gets in ze pool ja” “it was weird it was like it was offensive but like refreshing you know i don’t know i don’t know how i feel about it” yeah she got in trouble the old redneck on duck dynasty that dude got in trouble the owner of the clippers got in trouble and i’m not saying what these people did wasn’t offensive i’m not sayin’ that shit what pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age you know they’re fucking old you know what did you think they thought you never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden it went down this crazy road “whoa whoa whoa let’s get back to the cookies grandma let’s leave that shit over here what the fuck” yeah they’re old what did you think they thought i mean– i’m gonna be honest with you people were too hard on that clippers guy man i’m telling you for an  white guy that wasn’t that bad all right dude he didn’t drop the “n” word once that’s unbelievable for an  white guy the “n” word should have been carpetbombed through that whole tape he never said it once if you go back and listen to that tape– go back and listen to it other than instagram he’s pretty fucking liberal he’s like “you can hang out with them you can have sex with them just don’t promote it on instagram” yeah it was the weirdest most compartmentalized like racism i ever heard in my life something about instagram i didn’t get it other than that he was wide open “you can make a snowman with them go to a water park rub your bellies together just don’t promote it on instagram” “hey what about facebook” “i don’t give a fuck about facebook keep it off of instagram” yeah dude you understand the guy is  years old do the math this dude was born in  that’s  years before jackie robinson broke the color barrier first  and a half years of this guy’s life he watched allwhite baseball and it was fine first  and a half years “up next whitey willoughby there’s a line shot out to peter peckerwood what a catch unbelievable in to chris cracker what a great day what a great day for a ballgame white baseball white players” dude his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the native americans all right that’s who taught him his abcs you know “ a b c d e…  hey get that savage off my property get out of here i thought we killed all you people put a fence around them  h i j k… ” yeah what did you think was gonna happen the owner of the clippers you know what his big crime was he lived too long he did if he’d died around   nobody would have noticed dude look at walt disney walt disney was a known antisemite but he died in the early ’ nobody gives a shit look at him he’s got a castle bunch of mice running around nobody cares this guy kept living telling you you can live too long you can live too long i’m telling you you wear out your welcome i swear to god this fucking guy i bet in the ’s he was considered a hippie you know just walking around “hey you can hang out with ’em you can have sex with ’em man you know” his dad’s getting all pissed off “let me tell you something see you stay with your own you stay with your own” that’s true though life can pass you by it happens you just keep living and living basically i think you got like   years to absorb as much as you can and then that’s it that’s all you know ‘cause right around then you get married and it’s over right you have a couple of kids you’re sucked in the bubble you don’t have time to pay attention to what’s going on out in the world you’re stuck with these kids “it’s shitting all over the place don’t be a serial killer don’t touch that” you’re just stuck in that you have three four kids that is a  sentence trying to get them all through college society just keeps fucking going you get the last one through college step back out of the bubble– you don’t know what happened you’re not even paying attention you go back to your old record collection  someone sticks a mike in your face you’re gonna get in trouble yeah it’s one of the sad things about life you get old and it passes you by i feel it passing me by i’m  years old i don’t even have kids but i can’t keep up anymore i had a college gig coming up i was like i gotta figure out what these kids are into i was  when a senior was born i got to figure out what these dudes are into so i guess they’re into like this like dj music or some shit so i’m like all right i’ll watch some of this you know so i have like a reference or two i don’t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like “what’s up with this monica lewinsky is this crazy i mean this – is my stylus gonna work i don’t know” so i put this shit on dude i lasted  seconds ninety seconds i was openminded “all right put it on” ninety seconds later i’m like this old man “ah this isn’t music” you know “when i was a kid you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil now that was music and you had one ballad every album started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in it went to color yeah that was music” yeah all of this shit’s passing me by i’ll get in trouble later on in my life transgender athletes i don’t fucking understand that you know i understand you want to switch around i don’t give a shit but i’m a sports fan that’s a really new concept to me that you can be a dude right ranked  in the fucking world you have your dick cut off you put on a sports bra and now you’re the  tennis player in the world just coming out there with your man shoulders  that doesn’t seem fair i might be wrong i might just be an old guy i have no idea but i’m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that mma you can’t have that shit am i nuts that is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman jesus christ he might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight “hold still” “her ground and pound is incredible” yeah i’m not saying these people are right and i’m not saying that i’m right i know i’m a fucking moron ya know but that duck dynasty guy– i know what he said was wrong but i don’t get the shock said that homophobic stuff and people are like “can you believe” yeah i totally can believe it if i was in vegas i would have put  of my shit on that he was gonna say it i’d give him a  benefit of the doubt just in case are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints like what did you think he thought did you think he had some progressive ideas on samesex marriage  yeah didn’t he think… didn’t he think exactly what you thought… he thought you know you know what kills me too that fuckin’ kinda shit that homophobic stuff that all comes from the church man doesn’t it come from that shit there’s something in there i never read the book all right i tried to they need to fucking update it they update itunes every fuckin’ six days can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth… for someone like me right that’s where he gets all those fucking ideas that duck dynasty guy it’s not his fault that he went to– he went to sunday school in like  you know i think all of that shit comes from the church they just fuckin’ brainwash you you know don’t clap don’t clap i don’t read i don’t read follow someone else i’m telling you they brainwash you come into the church your brain’s all empty they fill it like a jelly donut  just brainwash you “ say what we say when we say it   say it again then you can go home to your toys ” “ all right i’ll say it   i’ll say it again   now can i go home to my toys ” right and you repeat everything they say the good the bad and the fucking horrific they stick a star on your forehead “you’re a big boy” “looks like people like me” you get on with your life you go to college you get a master’s degree in english like this redneck dude had he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it right yours goes “whack whack” mine goes “whackafuckin’whack” dude makes a zillion bucks gets his own tv show he’s loving life and out of nowhere here comes that same question sixty years later from sunday school and he stands up like the manchurian candidate “jesus liked hookers and lepers doesn’t like the queers” and everybody freaks the fuck out and he’s like “that’s what they said” and they’re all dead “oh where’d everybody go i thought i was a good boy” he’s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat i don’t understand i don’t understand why a group like glaad right i always forget it’s gay lesbian a… whatever the fuck it stands for all right why do they go after the old guy in the boat why don’t they go after the people writing the book right “hey could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages” they’re not gonna do that that’s the vatican they’re their own city they got a wall around their own city they’re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it’s nothing they’re not taking that call “oh what happened really go fuck yourself” click they don’t care  i learned a long time ago i think whatever you’re into you’re into but i’m not into that religious stuff where– and this is why i actually walked away from my religion i had to be honest with myself one i didn’t like to go– i didn’t like going to church every week you know i just didn’t part of it was i’m lazy i don’t like getting up on sundays and the other part was i already heard all the stories okay heard them three four times the dude hasn’t come back yet you know we’re just sort of mulching over the same shit here i got it – right –  and the other aspect was you know i actually– i had to be honest with myself i felt my religion made sense and everybody else’s sounded stupid  i did look i’m not talking about the basis of every religion basis of every religion makes sense you know the ten commandments don’t kill anybody don’t touch my wife that’s my bike right that all makes sense of which i’ve broken i think i’ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one that’s it i haven’t killed anybody yet right but the murderous thoughts that i have sometimes i think i could do it like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers and they’re wearing those goldtoed like dress socks and they cross their feet at the ankles and they just start rubbing their feet together like i see the whole thing see the whole thing wrapping that sock shh… shh… shh… right see the whole thing so we’ll see still early on right but just the stories of how we got here and where we’re going and what happens after we die everybody else’s religion sounded stupid you know like i live out in los angeles there’s a bunch of scientologists out there and the first time i heard the story of scientology i was like “that is the dumbest shit i have ever heard in my life”  yeah like your guy’s name is ron ron and he wasn’t alive thousands of years ago so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery this guy was alive like   years ago he had a driver’s license social security number there’s like footage of him stubbing his toe “motherfucker” right i know what happened he was working at denny’s he got sick of it “i’ll start a religion hey everybody there’s this spaceship coming back everybody’s getting sneakers this is tom cruise we’re gonna try to make you clear right” look i’m paraphrasing i’m paraphrasing to be fair to the scientologists i am paraphrasing but that’s essentially what they believe in and i said that is the dumbest shit i ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water died and came back three days later so… yeah that made total sense to me so it just hit me one day i was like why does that make sense and that shit doesn’t you know they got a spaceship in theirs you know we– right we got the space shuttle you know there’s sneakers there’s a lot of shit i can relate to in this why does that sound so dumb to me you know what it is i think it’s ’cause i heard their story when i was an adult i heard my story when i was four years old right when i heard my story there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney giving me christmas toys if i lost a tooth there was a fairy there was the easter bunny why wouldn’t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever he did of course that made sense what happened was as i got older all of that stuff started to fall right “ah son there is no fat fuck it’s your mother and i your mom’s the tooth fairy rabbits don’t have eggs her tits are fake the nba is fixed bankers are cunts most of your dreams won’t come true” right and i was just like “wow this is how the world is” and meanwhile this shit was just floating this  gorilla of this fucking story i just had to make a decision what am i gonna do what am i gonna do with this am i gonna cling to it be that person “that’s very offensive to me and other christians and…” become that douche all right and be like the casual christian right with like one foot on base just “yeah i kind of go a couple of times a year and like if my parents come to town i act like i go all the time and i don’t go anymore” or my last option which was basically just just let go of the shit you know just let go  just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling you know that moment where the shooter or whatever you call them is just sliding with that rock right just let me do this right just sliding and you think he’s along for the ride the two of them they’re a team and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking… that rock just keeps going this dude just stops that’s what i did with my religion i just let go of it i didn’t read a riot act to anybody i just let go of it “and on the third day he rose again in fulfillment of the scriptures…” i just floated away  so now it’s like i’m in this weird place where i’m not in any religion right now unrestricted free agent you know  i’d like to believe in something so i’ve been going around asking people what their shit is and i haven’t been able to find anything trying to be openminded i was doing a gig in helsinki and over there they’re like lutheran and what they believe they believe when you die you’re dead and that’s it dead like a pigeon just– just layin’ there over blew my mind i’m like “really you’re just dead” like my religion was you die and then you go up to get judged right god pops in the dvd of your life “well i don’t know about this right here mind explaining yourself” this might be the most arrogant thing i say all night but i actually resent the fact that i’m gonna get judged someday like if that’s true that somebody’s gonna judge me that doesn’t even make any sense it’s like dude you made me so this is your fuckup all right let’s not try to turn this around on me you know jesus christ you give me freedom of choice you make whores you have me suck at math and you don’t think this thing’s gonna go off the rails like you set me up to fail and now you got the balls to now question… your own goddamn work dude if i made a car if i built a car and it didn’t run i wouldn’t burn it forever “you evil piece of shit” just light it on fire i wouldn’t i would troubleshoot is there gas in the engine is the battery charged “anything beyond this i got to get a real man to look at it but i believe in you i’m gonna try and help you out” yes my religion it’s nuts it’s fucking nuts like my religion like the way i was brought up is like you know you can make it to heaven but like some of your family members possibly couldn’t or some of your friends doesn’t even make sense like how am i supposed to enjoy heaven if that’s the deal right just sitting here waiting for my friends to show up “jesus christ where the hell are they it’s been like  years they must have ate a lot of brussels sprouts or some shit doing some yoga right” and then one day it just settles in that they didn’t make it and then what i’m still gonna enjoy heaven right jesus coming walking over “hey how is it going everybody isn’t this great isn’t this great” “yeah dude it’d be even better if all my family members and friends weren’t burning for fucking ever kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there jstar what do you think hey dude i didn’t ask you to come over you came walking over with your big dumb sandals ‘hey hey how is it going over here’ why did you come over here i don’t give a damn dude tell your dad i don’t give a fuck i’m already in here i’m already in here what are you gonna kick me out afterwards go fuck yourself i knew he was gonna be like that i knew it the boss’s son is the worst fucking sense of entitlement” so yeah so they believe when you die you’re dead and i was like so you’re just dead like how do you wrap your head around not existing i couldn’t get my head around it he goes “well like before when you were born do you remember that” and i was like “no” and the guy’s like “yeah it’s just like that” i’m like not only does that make sense that is absolutely terrifying dude i got to be honest i hate how scared i’m getting as i get older i’m developing all these new fears like i have a fear of flying now i never had a fear of it it’s not straightacrosstheboard flying i don’t like small planes all of a sudden i just don’t like them and it has nothing to do with the plane i believe in the planes okay i just don’t believe in the pilots ‘cause you know what i don’t think the airline does either which is why that dude is flying that little plane the airline was basically like “all right we’ll give you like  people see how you do you know you fly them up you land you bring another  back we’ll let you do this for a while you do this for a while we don’t get any complaints no up and down up and down none of that shit we’ll move you up to  people and then one day you’ll be in a jet–” whoo we’re going a little faster right big planes you’re getting the fuckin’ pilot that knows what he’s doing he’s probably fought in a war he’s used to getting shot at he can’t bring this bus in it’s a joke right a bunch of people whining in the back “my headphones don’t work” he doesn’t give a fuck right he’s up there sleeping he’s trying to make something happen he’s so goddamn bored that’s a stud up there right so one time i’m flying into albany new york okay a city that nobody really goes to so i’m on a smaller plane and everything is going great all of a sudden out of nowhere we hit this turbulence  and it stops and everybody looks around laughing nervously like…  all of a sudden it comes back with a vengeance you can literally hear the metal the plane’s made of like… all of a sudden this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises “whoa whaaa whoa whaaaa whoa” i’m not gonna lie i have never been so fucking scared in my entire life dude that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child but turn around and see a  mustachioed male going… “whoo whaaa whoa” dude the hair was standing up on my arms i’m praying to a higher power i don’t even believe in the shit i just wish i had the balls to turn around and be like “dude would you shut the fuck up jesus christ be a man push it down push it down deny your feelings act like you have answers do some man shit right now do some man shit” jesus christ you know “you think i’m not up here thinking… ‘whaaa whoa’ i am but how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house” you know what kills me what absolutely kills me is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy marry him and make half… whooo… whaaaa… fucking kids and you know what we become weaker as a species we do  do you remember back in the day when you watched the discovery channel about animals now they build cars but it used to be about animals right now it’s all car stuff “looking forward to getting that carburetor today the carburetor didn’t fit” “what do you mean the carburetor doesn’t fit dad’s gonna be mad”  there’s never enough time to build the car it’s so fucking stupid “we got to have this bus done by thursday” or else what the guy doesn’t want it anymore all right “you’ll get the thing when we finish it okay this is a safety issue you want brakes on it then go get yourself some fucking lunch” so before…  before there used to just be animals and this is what i noticed everything from a lion all the way down to an insect okay if you had one drop of… whoo… whaaa… bitchy blood in you none of the females would fuck you that was it your life was over your life was over no ant pussy for you your entire miserable eightday ant life ’cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew and the female ant saw it they’re like “all right stay away from that one stay away from that one he’s gonna jeopardize the whole hill and stacy listen to me” human beings have empathy some woman will fall in love “well he’s nice he wears a sweater he likes to bake you know he lets me finish my stories” which is all great qualities okay but you got to know when you shack up with a guy like that you’re rolling the dice you’re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over ’cause god forbid he picks your goddamn house this is the dude who has your back who’s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door and you’re gonna turn around all you’re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window i don’t know man that’s risky you know in reality i’m being too hard on that guy yeah i am i am ’cause i was just as scared as he was except i didn’t scream out like he did and that’s simple the simple reason was this dude he was hugged too much as a child having people going “how was your day what’s wrong” and all of that shit you know that’s why i came down here i came out here to tell you guys you got to stop hugging your children you are ruining this country now you can hug your daughters you got to do that you got to do that hug those hooker shoes right out of them let them know that you’re a good man and to find another man like you you got to do that but your son you can hug them a little bit but every three four you got to fucking knock ’em down right “come on it didn’t hurt get up” i didn’t come from a family i don’t know about you guys i didn’t come from a touchyfeely… “call me when you get there mwah mwah” none of that shit first time my mom hugged me i think was like once when i was little and when i moved out that was it and we only hugged ’cause we knew we were supposed to so we just tried to like it was like two parking meters came to life like we almost bumped heads it was horrific fucking horrific to this day sometimes i drive down the street and i think about that hug and it’s just so awful i have to like shout the memory out of my head i’ll just be driving down the street just be like… aaaaah anybody else like that you ever have to shout stuff out of your head there’s something about me like all my regret comes up when i’m in the shower i don’t know what it is i think ’cause i’m in the shower and i have time to think and i’ll just think of shit i did in third grade where i just made an ass of myself and i’ll just be in the shower just being like…  and my wife’s always just like “is everything okay in there” i’ll just be like “yeah yeah just accidentally turned on the hot water turned it on too much” “every day” so… yeah… i actually asked my mother one time when i finally got out in the world and i saw how other families interacted i finally asked her “how come we never did the hugging thing how come we didn’t do that stuff” she was like “i wanted to hug you kids when you were little but i was afraid it was gonna make you gay” and i was like “you were afraid” and she goes “well it was your father that’s what it was protecting him like i always do he was afraid he said you don’t know how to raise boys and if you hug them that’s what’s gonna happen so in a marriage there’s compromises” yeah so she basically never hugged us ’cause my dad said if she did it was gonna make us gay and i got to tell you that was a great thing that my dad did for me let me finish before you start blogging okay and i end up on a split screen on good morning atlanta “comedy could it go too far last night at the tabernacle–” sitting there next to some fucking cheetoeating blogger so yeah this is the deal i’m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid as far as i know i don’t have any kids as far as i’d think if you have a kid what do you want to do you want to improve on your childhood okay you want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn’t work so that was my dad as fucked up as that was that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about the way a veteran doesn’t talk about going to war so i figure if that was his improvement on his childhood his childhood just must have been something like “don’t change his shitty diaper let him figure it out for himself get out in the rain you shitty baby hey let me handle this lady why are you still standing here you shit toddler” so he took it from that… and knocked it down to “don’t hug him it’s gonna make him gay” right and then maybe someday i ever have a kid i’ll whittle it down to like “he’s not taking drama class all right he’s not taking drama class ’cause i said so lady let me handle this” i won’t fix everything and that’s not a homophobic thing either that i wouldn’t send my hypothetical son to drama class okay it isn’t i would send… i’d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class okay my son can’t fucking do any of that shit unless i’m sending him to one of those fame high schools where everybody’s doing it one of those creative schools you go to the cafeteria everybody’s like  cottage cheese what is it made of  then he can do all he wants then he can do all the fuck he wants but there’s no way i’m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals he’s gonna get the shit kicked out of him he’s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass and then i have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like “there’s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here” i don’t want to do that i want to find the fucking eightyearold what is he this tall i want to find the kid that did it to my kid tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue right and just leave him there you wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he’s down to his last breath and then you turn him upsideright and you grab him by his throat you say something horrific “you ever do that again i’m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog” all right  over so yeah a lot in my life has changed since i last came through here to atlanta i got married that’s the big thing yes i did very happy about that i’m very happy because it was starting to get weird it’s like  years old “my girlfriend yeah we’re gonna go out and get some pop” going to parties it was just weird ‘cause i hang out with people my age and they all got married they all had kids i just couldn’t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage… marriages and kids i felt like a little kid just sitting there going like “the superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal bipartisan with the middle eastern crisis it’s just…” “it’s an advanced learning program the deadline is may  we have to stop the bullying…” “…with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate” when the conversation would come around to me i felt like i was eight years old i’d just be like “did anybody see the youtube video where the raccoon stole the cat’s food and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn’t care he just came in like this like george foreman and then he reached out he had hands all of a sudden he had hands i didn’t know they had hands he scooped it up and he ran away on paws did you guys know they had hands” so now i’m married so the next move is you’re supposed to have a kid which i would love to do but i’m  years old i’m just thinking it’s too fucking late ya know come on man i’m gonna have a kid i’m gonna die of natural causes when the kid’s in fifth grade throwing him a frisbee “we used to use these on a saturday” do a face plant my kid’s standing there “mom dad’s sleeping again” i feel hopelessly behind all my friends have kids most of my friends who have kids are cool but i got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid that i don’t understand anything anymore you know those people the most basic shit “hey man it’s kind of cold out today” “dude you don’t understand you don’t understand cold till you got a twoyearold with a mitten up his ass and you’re trying to get chocolate off the other one’s face” “all right all right i get it you have a more complex life but i still understand being cold teeth chattering kind of lets me know right” “mine just turned six” “mine just turned seven” i just feel hopelessly behind so what i’m actually thinking of doing i’m thinking about adopting yeah absolutely recycle you know think globally act locally everything doesn’t have to be brandnew you know it’s like when you redo your kitchen you got custom up top you got ikea down the bottom right i’d love to adopt it’s a great thing to do but if i do it i’m not telling any of my friends i’m just gonna show up with the kid one day just to piss ’em off “mine just turned six” “mine just turned seven” i’d love to just show up with an eightyearold like “dominoes yeah now i get to tell you what you don’t understand sevenyearold wait till they turn eight eight is such a funny age terrible twos try the instant eights bam they’re just there like… with all their issues…” i should do it though i should adopt i think it’s a great thing to do and i already know what i want to get i do i want to get like an ’ ’… always garaged good dentition do you know what i would love to do i’d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop wouldn’t that be amazing like find the kid that made this shirt just show up at the factory like hey “come on bring it in bring it in you little maniac how you doing you’re going back to the states lshaped couch flat screen tv get in the car the rest of you keep sewing but you you’re coming home with me” yeah dude how easy… how easy would that kid be to raise after the hell he’s been through all i gotta do is let him sit down i am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met just bring him home “have a seat” he’ll be like “i get to sit down” “yeah lay down on the couch” he’ll be like “it’s like a cloud it’s like a cloud” i’ll get him a bowl of fritos put on cricket or soccer one of those sweatshop sports i don’t know the kid would love me so that’s my first draft pick all right coming out of the gate with that in the second round i’d probably get like an ’ boy soldier ya know yeah shore up the offensive line you gotta protect the blindside that’s how fucked up the world is there’s little boys out there fighting in wars so that’s a twofer i can drag him out of that hell give him something of what’s left of his childhood and god forbid if the dollar ever collapses right shit goes south zombies take over i got backup everybody thinks i’m gonna be the problem meanwhile i got this sawedoff chuck norris… standing next to me  kills confirmed fucking kills they’re not stories can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster you can’t coach that right i got to be honest with you i feel like i’d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider i might be nuts but i feel like i could come down on the sweatshop kid right “i said get in there and clean up your goddamn room i’m getting sick of this shit goes for you too if you want but you you’ve been out of line all day mister don’t even start that shit don’t even start that shit you say that every time yes you do every fucking time you say that you know the answer you want me to say it again i’ll break it down to you you know why it is you want to know why ‘cause you sew all right yeah you sew dude he’s fucking killed people do you understand that no he doesn’t he doesn’t have to make his bed too no he doesn’t because he doesn’t sleep in the bed he’s out in the bushes all night talking to himself freaking me the fuck out all right oh fuck you fuck you he scares me too he scares me too don’t even start that shit you wanted a big brother and i got you one don’t even start that shit all right all right you’re right stop crying stop crying shouldn’t have yelled at you i just thought i could fucking bring him in give him a couple of pop tarts i figured he’d chill out fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows doing that full metal jacket shit no you can’t give him back it doesn’t work that way there he is there he is what’s up buddy what’s going on we were just talking about you just doing like a little surprise thing you feeling all right you feeling all right you’re not looking through those eyebrows huh everything okay” so i figure uh… i don’t know if i’ll do it maybe i’m too selfish i have no idea i’m all over the fuckin’ map do you know what i want to do right now i actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter man i do that’s my latest thing you know why it is it’s ’cause i live in los angeles yeah and it’s an absolute clusterfuck when you go into land in that city just look out the window and just look at the complete lack of planning there’s not even zoning laws they’ll build like a skyscraper next to a house next to a gun range and then there’s like a fucking daycare center right the city doesn’t even work even when everything else works so god forbid the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens where you gonna go in a city like that see you guys are all right out here in atlanta you’re all right i don’t know maybe in atlanta might be crazy you’re on the outskirts you’re fine you’re fine you don’t live in a desert you slam your face in a birdbath you’re cool drink that water for a good  days la there’s nowhere to go that’s why i love the helicopter dude the helicopter is the ultimate “fuck this i’m out” vehicle all you gotta do is assess the situation zombie coming up the street “fuck this this looks safe” you just land it you could sit there hovering just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick yeah so i told my wife i want to fly a helicopter she’s just like “yeah no” which i know that came from a place of love but it still kind of annoyed me just that she said that shit then i was just gonna be like “oh all right thought i was gonna get to do that but you said no so… there goes that hey what other dreams aren’t i gonna get to achieve like do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask” yeah i’m still gonna do it i’m just not gonna tell her i’m just gonna go out and do it pass the goddamn class and when i get my license i’m not going to tell her i’m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf and hang it by a nail in the living room she’s just gonna be like “what is that what is that for what does that mean” “yeah someday you’ll see someday you’ll see when the shit hits the fan and you’re freaking the fuck out and i’m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter” “what is that” “shut the fuck up and get in” now you guys think i’m bullshitting i’m not i’m serious i’m  in on this and ever since i got into it i’m seeing helicopters everywhere i never realized how many helicopters there were driving down the street like henry hill looking up at them… doing key bumps and shit “they’re after me swear to god” i’m seeing stories about them it’s just like that old advertising anecdote “i never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until i needed a mattress and then all of a sudden they’re all over the place and then i bought a mattress and then it all went away” it’s the same shit i saw this story down in orange county right down in orange county california this guy gave helicopter tours for  years–  years without incident hands the business off to his son the american dream “i built it up for  years here you go son make the family and the family name proud” “all right dad i love you” all right this poor kid five days in he’s supposed to give a tour to a couple only the dude shows up the kid thought it was weird but he’s like “i need the money i gotta give him a tour” right so he takes this guy up ten minutes into the tour the dude fucking jumped out yeah five days in five days in from the balloons and the cake “we love you son keep the family tree going the traditional line” five fucking days later this kid he probably barely had the speech down just sitting there flying the helicopter “all right if you look out the left side of the aircraft that’s orange county there’s over  miles of beaches there put your seatbelt back on  miles of beaches was established as a county in  sir please don’t open the door sir what are you doing sir no no don’t don’t stop no no what the fuck what the fuck oh my god oh my god oh my god what the fuck what the fuck fuck” air traffic control “i don’t know who’s on this frequency but you really need–” “somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter” five days in so i read further into the story turns out the guy who jumped out he was  years old terminally ill he was in pain every day they couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him and he had had enough at that point that guy immediately became a hero in my world know what i love about him not only did he make the decision he didn’t go out like some pussy right handful of pills watching a romantic comedy wrapped in an afghan that nana made fuck that guy went out like a man “take me up in a chopper i’m looking at the land i love and then i’m jumping out like a superhero” i loved it yeah  this guy should have been wearing a fucking cape i can’t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life like “fuck you disease i decide” ripping tubes out gets a burger shotguns a beer “take me up in the chopper” he probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard he’s not even listening to this guy giving the tour right “over  miles of beaches put your seatbelt back on established as a county in  sir please don’t try to open the door no no don’t don’t don’t”   incredible but here’s the thing i left out one small thing there is one small thing the guy fucking lived yeah yeah they were out over the ocean  feet up you’d think that would be enough so i’m thinking he must have gone in like greg louganis like no splash just… but witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air so that sounds like a hell of an impact i think he accidentally did the most epic  belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter but that didn’t change what he was trying to do where his heart was i still love this guy i just feel bad for him on the way down he’s got to be thinking “three more seconds of pain two more seconds” wham  “oh my god this is worse this is way worse” it has a happy ending though he later died at the hospital that’s right so here’s to him god bless him i hope i have the balls someday so where do you go from there well as i mentioned last time i came through town i wanted to get a gun you know i do yeah but i’ve finally given up on that i gave up on that dream my wife doesn’t want me to get one so yeah she didn’t want– dude you got to pick your fucking battles i’m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly i can’t fucking have some  hanging around “i’ll do whatever i want all right what i say goes eat it” can’t be that person now it fucking bums me out ’cause all i wanted to do was just get a  that’s all i wanted perfect gun for home protection  caliber you’re laughing at that sir that’s not enough i don’t know i’m down south what do you think that’s not enough right you want– shotgun right  you guys are out of your minds you’re out of your fucking minds let me ask all you gun guys who are gonna make fun if i had a  “what’s with your  that little queer gun do you keep it between your buttocks is that the holster is that what you do with your gay little gun you need a big gun” all you fucking guys let me ask you this all you guys with your guns… have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs have you ever done that or you’re like most people you take it down to the gun range you put your earplugs in put your headset on take it out of the briefcase you got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses right you look at your spread or whatever and then you put it back in there right you ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs ‘cause that’s what’s gonna happen when that intruder comes in you’re not gonna have time to be “hang on a second let me just…” yeah you’re not gonna have time dude i shot a fiveshot  one time without earplugs i was landscaping this guy’s yard he comes out at the end of the job “hey i got this fiveshot  you want to go down the street there’s a burnedout car we can take a couple of shots” you know what’s funny every other state is fuckin’ dying laughing at this point in the joke because it’s so goddamn ridiculous until i get down to the south and you guys just sit here staring at me like “all right so what happened pretty standard i thought this was gonna be a comedy show you’re reading from your journal i don’t understand what the– it’s not a real compelling story” i’m mowing a fucking lawn and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says “let’s shoot it at a burnedout car” okay jesus christ can we agree on that so i’m like all right let’s do it fuck it so i go down there never shot a gun before i bring the gun up point it at the car i pull the trigger i saw the muzzle flash i felt a kick i never heard the gun i pulled the trigger all i just heard was…  i shot the gun four more times never heard it didn’t get louder didn’t get quieter just kept seeing flashes  all right so let’s take one of your fucking guns let’s just say for the sake of argument all right you got that thing sitting on a nightstand loaded right for god’s sakes tell me you have it there don’t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there you got the thing fucking loaded ready to go   in the morning this is when the psycho’s coming in too right that’s when they come in   in the morning they don’t come by at  at night as you’re cutting into a pork chop “i’m out of my mind i’m coming back in  minutes so stretch out your hammies ’cause it’s gonna get crazy” that’s not how it works they wait till you’re dead asleep   in the morning right before rem sleep is kicking in so let’s just say for the sake of argument all you gun guys you got your thing loaded right your piece right right there loaded for bear you’re lying there same scenario right one leg under the covers one without shirt  in the morning you’re just…  meanwhile some psycho sneaking in through the living room window right he brings in a fucking sickle and he’s just listening listens all the way down that hall and he just hears…  he’s trying not to squeak on the floorboards and you’re just fucking lying there  all of a sudden that little dog on the floor is just like…   “what’s the matter what’s the matter what’s the matter what’s the matter boy you hear something what’s the matter what are you barking for you’re shaking what’s the matter huh you hear something what’s– come on man quit fucking around i got to go to work tomorrow”  all of a sudden boom that door flies open you just see this shadowy figure you pick up that gun blam  and you fucking miss you miss you can’t see now you can’t hear that’s two out of five senses what are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed you’re still gonna be shooting over here meanwhile you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed takes off your head if you had the  you could still hear your ears would be ringing but you could hear that fucker coming across and you could shoot at him and he would leave he would leave you guys just won’t get off the fact that it’s a fuckin’  you’re like psychotic with this shit all right no no no no no no no let me– i will extend an olive branch to you people okay i get it i get it that a  is basically a ‘roidedup bb gun i got it okay i understand that if you actually want to kill somebody you have to basically have the gun up to somebody’s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger i understand that okay but i maintain i don’t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house i could defend my house with a bb gun i don’t give a fuck how tough you are i don’t care if i started shooting at you with a bb gun at the very least you have to go back outside and regroup that’s a fact that is a fact if i caught you in your elbow that might be the end of your night “look i’m coming back i’m coming back” i’ve been trying to get along with my wife better i’m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship i’m not turning out the pilot light though all right i’m keeping some fight in me i’m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like “i guess we’re making holiday cookies” that dude with the bowed shoulders “she makes them and then i’m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them i don’t even think they taste that good but just–” no i stand my ground sometimes sometimes i let it go you just got to figure it out we had a fight the other night she got so mad at me she was like “you can just sleep downstairs you can just sleep downstairs” i couldn’t believe it it’s one of the most arrogant things i’ve ever heard in my life one adult telling another adult where they can sleep “you can just sleep downstairs” like i was just gonna sit up in bed grab a blanket like linus “all right hey where downstairs by the way like over here downstairs or like more over here where should i sleep” it’s like are you out of your mind i go “i’m not sleeping downstairs” she’s like “where you gonna sleep then” i’m like “where i always sleep i will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if i want to what are you gonna do i’m bigger than you i’ll hang onto the covers try to get me out no tickling go ahead” yeah i was like “you don’t tell me where to sleep i sleep where i want to sleep” she’s like “well you don’t tell me where to sleep” i’m like “i’m not the one telling people where to sleep” it was one of those classic relationship fights it’s like  in the morning you’re both half naked she’s not wearing a bra you got half a ball hanging out “and another thing no no i need to say this the other day i felt slighted” it’s fuckin’ unreal but what kills me is that there’s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit yeah you talk to them they’ll be “hey how’s it been going” “it’s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch you know how that is right” no i don’t i don’t understand how did you get yourself into that situation like what are you afraid of what is she gonna do if you say no what is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table i understand if you’re dating some woman and she does that ufc mma shit then you got to sleep where she says to sleep you got to she’s gonna come at you “well let’s get you in an arm bar” “all right all right all right” tapping out or even worse she chokes you out you wake up on the couch like  minutes later just grab your jacket off the back of the couch “i fucking hate when she does this it’s like it’s not even fair have a debate like a normal person” all right i’m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here someone who’s actually been sleeping on the couch okay so there’s the first fear out the window okay she can’t physically dominate you so that’s gone what’s the next fear she’s gonna cut off the sex yeah rub one out neutralized it’s the most empty threat there is do it right in front of her “join me” yeah i’ve never understood that threat that’s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator but you got a sandwich in your pocket a neverending sandwich like some biblical shit like jesus with the fucking bread or whatever so now what’s the last thing she can do what can she do now be moody you can’t handle that walk by your tv without looking at you only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen who gives a fuck my wife does that i just sit there i just start commentating “here she comes again walking by the tv she really must be mad” she’s never bodyslammed me once ever i’m not saying to be a dick all right i’m just saying you got to keep them honest every once in a while you got to have a little pushback “hey hey hey hey hey” rest of the shit– i’m learning that about women you just want to keep them calm just keep them calm like a rescue dog right just everything’s cool everything’s cool just “yeah yeah yeah this is great this is great i’m having a great time no your friends are awesome your friends are awesome very interesting party i am talking to people i’m talking to people i am having a good time here” that’s what you do you just do that enough then when you bark back you got a little something here’s an olive branch i’ve extended to her it’s basically… we fight a lot over television i’ve kind of come her way she’s come my way she watches a little bit of sports i occasionally will watch a romantic comedy which i don’t care the nerd’s gonna fuck the cheerleader i’ll watch it right i don’t mind them it’s an uplifting story i just don’t like the love scenes in romantic comedies they creep me out they’re just so fucking nice it’s like missionarystyle there’s candles that stupid saxophone music  it always goes down like the saxophone implies the penetration right ‘cause they can’t show it they got to make her this onedimensional this little angel they ignore the other  of her sexuality no hairpulling no assslapping none of that shit none of that taboo stuff of a woman’s sexuality that’s never brought up that whole “hold me down but let me up but hold me down choke me but let me breathe but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit i want to feel your power but i want to be safe but let me know if you really wanted to” that whole fifty shades of rape whatever the hell that is yeah i don’t even pretend to understand it i remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit i didn’t even know what she was doing i was just so psyched to be getting laid i was like… and she just kept taking my hand and she kept putting it right here i didn’t know what she was doing i thought she was testing my core strength or some shit and finally i was just like “what are you doing” she says like “i don’t know i just kinda like ya know it’s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it why don’t you want to do it it’ll be fun” why don’t i want to do it i don’t think i want a passedout naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck having the cops show up “yeah she’s in here officer damndest thing it was her idea i swear to god it was her idea” yeah they always make it nice in those movies the raciest thing they’ll do is every once in a while they’ll kiss up against a wall i guess women like walls i didn’t know that a lot of upagainstthewall kissing “oh my god it’s the wall oh my god it’s supporting me maybe he’ll support me it’s a metaphor i love it” yeah i saw one the other night they were doing that and then out of nowhere they started having sex up against the wall i’m like finally something a little bit more interesting right but they were doing it standing up facing each other missionarystyle arguably one of the most difficult positions there is and they were doing it with little to no difficulty all she did was lift her leg up like that and that was it he was off to the races i ruined the movie for my wife i’m like “that is fucking bullshit bullshit” what does the guy have like a ushaped dick how is he doing anything is he sticking it in her navel did he grease up her thighs to hell with her needs like if all she’s gonna do is this she’s got to bring it up like an offsides call if that’s what she’s doing all right if not you got to make some adjustments you just got to grab the other leg you got to try to pick her up there use these muscles  maybe you could grab a doorjamb drop down try to come in try to do that dude nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than  seconds before they’re like “all right this is ridiculous okay my calves are burning i can’t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage i can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world” these guys in the movie they have no problem banging away then they pick them up like they’re not heavy they start walking down they see the bed they just lay her down on the bed dude i’m not trying to be a dick but every woman in here is heavy yeah you’re heavy you’re an adult female jesus christ when do you stop picking up your kids when they’re like five or six “get off of me jesus christ you’re gonna throw out my back go jump on your brother” an adult woman weighs  pounds  all the way up to god knows what and it’s not balanced weight most of it’s in your thighs and in your ass your head’s hanging off trying to counterbalance dude when guys go to the gym we don’t put  pounds on one side and a  over here “fuckin’ yeah” yeah it’s ridiculous trying to carry a naked woman it’s like trying to carry a halffilled waterbed mattress you’re like bumping into shit when you see the bed you don’t walk to it you slowly start picking up momentum then she bounces off this mattress hits the wall slides down the whole sex vibe’s ruined and you’re back to your sandwich in your pocket all right i’m out of time you guys were awesome thank you so much thank you thank you i had a great time i’ll see you next time thank you  what a wanker not funny at all just fucking screaming  shit like dribble running down his chin  yawn bill burr is a comedic genius  he has the courage to make people laugh at some very serious issues in life by identifying that the issues can be perceived in a different context one that is much more realistic than people would think  his parody of catholicism and christianity and how god and jesus might actually be thinking or feeling helped me truly lighten up and ended up changing my reactions behavior and feelings about being judged and judging others and myself  anyway any deed that results in people feeling more understanding and tolerant and less judgmental is a blessing  don’t let yourself get caught up in a stereotype when perceiving something as you believe others expect you to do  the truth shall set you free\n",

            "♪ ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah ♪ thank you! thank you very much! thank you all. oh, wow. that was exciting, wasn’t it? thank you, guys. have a seat, feel comfortable, relax. i want to thank everyone in la for a wonderful week. it’s been great here. you know what? it’s been ten years since the last time i played los angeles, if you can imagine. i know! i know, i’ve been gone for a very long time. and unbeknownst to you, it was a difficult ten years. i’m not gonna take you through all the agony i’ve been through, but it was tough. some of it you might’ve seen. i don’t know if you ever saw on tmz the big headline: “dave chappelle drunk onstage in detroit.” well, if you saw it, i wasn’t drunk. i had smoked some reefer… with some rappers. yeah. i don’t know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers, but their weed is very strong, stronger than i what i was accustomed to. the article goes on to say i was booed offstage, which is also incorrect. i was booed. i did not leave. it was a long bomb. it was a fucking nightmare. two puffs of weed, that’s all it was. two puffs. i never had that happen, where i take two puffs of weed, i looked at the guy next to me, i was like, “i’m gonna bomb, n i g g a. i can feel it.” and that guy called my name. “dave chappelle!” n i g g a s was like… normally, when you do a comedy show– you guys don’t know what it looks like up here, but n i g g a s be just looking up at you like… that’s how the show started. didn’t take long for their faces to switch up like, “what the fuck?” they started looking amongst themselves. so i knew i wasn’t doing good. i don’t remember what i was saying. it just took one person to break the ice. it was a black lady with a ford motor shirt on. stood up suddenly. “fuck you, dave chappelle!” i said, “excuse me?” she said, “i worked all week for this shit, and this show sucks!” and in a weird act of racial harmony, a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up. “yeah!” the whole crowd banded together and started chanting, “we want our money back! we want our money back!” i said, “oh, shit.” i snapped out of it. “good people of detroit, hear me. hear me now. you will never get your fucking money back.” fuck that. i said, “i’m like evel knievel. i get paid for the attempt. i didn’t promise this shit would be good.” “boo!” they said, “fuck you!” this went on for a long time. and then, after the show, i felt so bad, i took half of the money from the show– thousands of dollars– i said, “i’m gonna give this to charity.” you know what i did? i bought $25,000 worth of bubble gum and drove around detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry. i was very mad at detroit that night. because not only did i bomb, i had to go back to the very same room the next night and do it all over again. fucking nightmare. that would be like if you were having sex with a woman and, for some reason– this would never happen– but for some reason, she had a mousetrap in her pussy. you get caught in the trap. and then you’ve got to fuck her again tomorrow night. i’d still do it, but i’d be careful the next time. the old mousetrap-in-the-pussy trick, eh? fool me once. yeah. yeah, it was a tough time. and i wanted to give up sometimes. i almost did give up, but then, right before i gave up, i decided not to. but i made the call. they answered the phone. “hello? dancing with the stars.” i said, “not yet. not yet.” yeah. if you see me on that shit, it’s over. trust me. my spirit is broken. if you see me waiting for them judges… getting critiqued on my cha-cha, fuck that. i’ve been hanging out in– i haven’t been working in la, but i come out here and hang out and shit. i was out here a few weeks ago. i almost got arrested. i’m not bullshitting. this happens to a lot of black people. what happened was… i was coming out of one of those nightclubs in hollywood, and my friend saw me. i guess i was wobbling or something. so, he just rolled up. he’s a good friend of mine. he’s like, “hey, dave, give me the keys.” i was like, “all right, n i g g a, just take the keys.” and i got in the passenger’s side of my car, and he drove it. it was fine. just talking, chopping it up. and then, on the 10, the blue-and-whites hit us. now, i should tell you, the friend that was driving me was black, which really doesn’t have anything to do with the story other than to let you know there was fear in the car. not my fear. i’m black, but i’m also dave chappelle. so, i figured, you know, shit will probably be fine. traffic stop started off on the right foot. the cops came up to the driver’s side. “hi. how are you guys doing tonight?” and he recognized me immediately. “oh. dave chappelle.” and i looked at my friend like, “we’re getting out of this shit.” and then he says, “you guys were swerving in the lane. do you mind just stepping out of the car for a second?” still no cause for alarm. i looked through the rearview mirror. the body language of the arrest looked good. just talking. so, then i started fucking with the radio. you know a traffic stop is going good if you’re listening to the radio when someone else is outside of the car. but then, when i looked back in the rearview mirror, something had gone horribly wrong. that motherfucker was back there like… and the next thing i knew, they were stuffing him in the back of the car, and i thought what anybody would think in a situation like that: “oh, my god. what is gonna happen to me?” and the police walked up to the window. “mr. chappelle, we had to arrest your friend. he refused to take our breathalyzer test.” i said, “that motherfucker. not complying? that’s odd. so, officer, what’s gonna happen to me?” “you’re fine. we’re just gonna have to ask you to step out of the car so we can impound the vehicle, and we’ll arrange for you to have a ride home.” i said, “oh, well, no. i would rather you just give me the keys.” he said, “mr. chappelle, your friend already told us he’s your designated driver. we can’t let you drive in this condition.” i was like, “no, n i g g a, i’m good.” and then suddenly, the shit turned into vegas. he was like… “i’ll let you blow for it.” i said, “excuse me?” he said, “if you blow in my breathalyzer–” i said, “oh, n i g g a, i thought you was trying to get your dick sucked. what’s the– whew! whew!” “if you blow in my breathalyzer and pass, i’ll give you the keys to the car.” i said, “uh… set ’em up, n i g g a. let’s play.” and i blew in that thing. and it made a noise. “beep!” i said, “uh-oh.” and he looked at it. he said, “oh, well, mr. chappelle, i guess you’re free to go.” i said, “i am?” i didn’t know that thing didn’t pick up weed. i drove home on the miles an hour. yeah, it all worked out. it all worked out. i’m one of the lucky ones. it doesn’t work out that well for everybody. i saw that videotape of that lady that got beat up in la in traffic. you see that shit on rush hour traffic? they beat a black woman’s ass. this woman didn’t even do anything wrong. it’s fucked up. it was so fucked up, it didn’t even go to court. the city of l.a. just gave that woman $1.5 million for her pain and suffering. that is not bad, considering that’s the same amount of money that marcos maidana made to fight floyd mayweather the second time. and this woman obviously hasn’t trained a day in her life. you can see it on the tape. she didn’t come to fight. her guards were low. she was taking a lot of shots. everybody’s mad at police now. i watched that– you see that shit on netflix, making a murderer? the steven avery story. if you haven’t seen it, check it out. steven avery is in more trouble than any white person in the history of the united states has ever been in! in a justice system designed for him to thrive, he’s failed miserably twice. i can’t even wrap my mind around it. if making a murderer was about a black dude, that shit would be called duh! of course everything would go wrong. seems like he did it, all right. the motherfucker even had $200,000 for his legal defense. that should get you off in wisconsin. that’s like oj money. all he needed to get off that he didn’t have was a single black juror. that’s all it would’ve took. because only a black dude in the united states can look at other dudes and be like, “i think the police did this shit.” he’s fucked up in the game. that’s how oj got off. i’ve been watching that new oj show. i can’t get enough of that shit. doesn’t it bring back good memories? but i forgot just how polarizing that oj case was. and you know, i’ve met oj simpson on four different occasions in my life. and before the end of the show, i will tell you about each of those occasions. the first time i met oj simpson, i was in santa monica. -santa monica! -yeah! i can’t believe a black dude was like, “santa monica!” you the last n i g g a i would expect to say that. let me see your shoes. you got some vans on, n i g g a? what you got? “santa monica!” you? at the time, i was . i had done a show, and the guy from the club came up and was like, “hey, oj simpson’s here, and he said he wants to meet you.” i said, “what? fuck yeah!” i ran down the steps, and oj was down there. he’s like, “hey, young man. how are you? it’s very good to meet you. and you’re doing really good work, and i hope good things happen for you in your life.” i was like, “man, thanks, mr. juice.” standing beside him, was– i don’t know the nice way to say this– his soon-to-be-slain wife. ladies and gentlemen, man the fuck up, or you’re not gonna make it to the end of this show. just man the fuck up. she’s dead. we already know what happened. we don’t know who did it, but we know what happened. i should tell you, that woman was very nice to me. she actually embraced me. she said, “i think you’re adorable,” and she hugged me. she goes, “good luck to you,” and she held me for a long time. and i whispered in her ear, “bitch, are you trying to get us both killed?” i’m just kidding. i didn’t say that, but… that was the first time, in a nutshell. it’s good to see so many… so many different people here from so many different ethnicities. very diverse crowd. looks like you thought bernie sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker. but… surprise! it’s me. yeah. yeah, you know, i’m happy, really, to see black people come. a lot of black people don’t fuck with me like they used to. but there’s a few reasons you don’t see black people at my shows. one is because, obviously, black people have slower internet connections. i mean, that would be my guess. i don’t know what– actually, my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community i hold so dear. a couple of weeks ago, i was supposed to be in flint, michigan, for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in flint. i don’t know if you know this, but the water in flint is fucking poisonous. it’s actually making people sick. hollywood people are like, “so what? at least they have water.” but this water– this water is fucked up. so, a lot of black celebrities flew into flint, and they did a tremendous charity benefit, and i was on the schedule to appear. uh… so, the reason a lot of people haven’t heard about this benefit– it was the same day as the oscars. right, i know. so, i was on my way to the airport to go to flint, and then chris rock calls me and is like, “hey, dave, i got a ticket for you for the oscars. can you make it?” and i was like, “sure, n i g g a. i’m on my way to the airport right now.” come on, man. what am i gonna do about that water? what am i, a fucking superhero? i need to have fun. i need to live, too! i didn’t fuck that water up! stevie wonder was there. they didn’t need me. i’m sorry, everybody. i’d never been to the oscars. you’ve seen the movies i make. i was excited. i knew i was gonna get into some trouble, because when i was walking on the red carpet, the black press came after me. “excuse me, brother.” when you hear somebody call you “brother” too much, something terrible is about to happen. “excuse me, brother. brother?” and i looked back, and the motherfucker had a tuxedo with the kente cloth tie. i said, “uh-oh.” he said, “i just want to ask you a couple questions.” i said, “what publication are you with?” he said, “me? i’m with the daily bongo.” i said, “daily bongo? what the fuck? who the fuck reads this?” he said, “listen, brother, i just want to ask you a quick question. you understand that this year, this is a boycott for the oscars. so, i’m just wondering what made you, of all people, cross the motherfucking picket line and be here tonight.” i said, “boycott? n i g g a, i haven’t been working in ten years. what do you mean, boycott? i’ve been on strike. y’all n i g g a s didn’t stop working. i had to watch fucking key and peele do my show every night! so, fuck the daily bongo,” is what i said. i went to the oscars and had a wonderful time. i went in that fucking green room. it was filled with so many stars, i couldn’t even believe what i was seeing. hollywood was seducing me all over again. i was sitting back there. i’m smoking, drinking with the stars. and then two hollywood movie producers came over, right to me. “oh, my god. dave chappelle,” said the leader one. he was obviously gay. some guys, you can just tell. the other one seemed like a money guy. maybe he was from texas or some shit. but the gay one was definitely the leader because he did all the talking. and then he hit me with: “so, david, um… do you have any movie ideas that you would like to pursue?” the truth is, i don’t. but if you know the game, you’re not supposed to tell motherfuckers you don’t have ideas. i was like, “yeah, man. i got plenty of ideas.” and he called my bluff. “really? like what?” “huh? oh. um… um…” and then i just started making up shit that i thought maybe he’d like to see. i said, “i have a superhero idea.” he goes, “really?” i go, “yeah. he’s a– he’s a gay superhero.” he was like, “really?! what’s it called?” “huh? oh, it’s called– it’s called same hero, new boots. it’s about a gay sous-chef in san francisco… that gets bit by a radioactive rat on his shift when he’s taking out the trash and is blessed with powers beyond his wildest dreams, supersonic gay kind of powers. and he starts saving everybody in san francisco. but at first, he only saves gay people. later, he saves everybody, and the whole city just falls in love with him. the only problem is, no one remembers him when he saves them.” “well, i don’t understand. why wouldn’t they remember him?” i said, “because, dummy, he’s gay. he keeps changing his outfit. people come up– ‘thanks for saving me, sir. what’s your name anyway?’ he’s like, ‘same hero, new boots!’ and that motherfucker flies away.” he was like, “i like it a lot.” the texan didn’t like that shit at all. he was upset. “that’s impossible, a gay superhero.” i said, “what? well, i have others. i have a superhero you’d love, ’cause he’s stronger than superman and he fights for truth, justice and the american way, like superman, but more than superman. he beats up mexicans for no reason.” the texan’s like, “you got my attention.” i’m like, “man, this motherfucker’s so strong, he can fly and do all this great shit. only problem with this guy is he can’t even activate his powers unless he touches– unless he touches a woman’s vagina. not a long touch, just a couple of pats.” he said, “well, what’s the problem with that?” i said, “the problem, sir, is that our hero is not a handsome man. and he’s often short on cash. so, whenever trouble breaks out, he has to run around the city and convince women to let him pat their vaginas. ‘please, miss! that building’s on fire. can i pat your vagina? quickly. people are dying!’ but he can’t tell them exactly why. ‘eww! get away! you’re gross!’ ‘please, miss! people are dying! just a couple of pats!’ ‘eww! gross! get away!’ so, he rapes them. i know, i know. that’s the dilemma for the audience. because he rapes, but he saves a lot of lives. and he saves way more than he rapes, and he only rapes to save. but he does rape.” i didn’t realize it, but the whole green room was looking at us. all the celebrities were disgusted. “ohh.” that guy from texas was like, “here’s my card. call me on monday.” that worked out. the second time i met oj simpson. it was right after the trial of the century. there i was, now a young man of probably 23. oj simpson was the most famous, or infamous, face on planet earth. i was in a restaurant in beverly hills with my agents. i wasn’t alone in the restaurant, but i was alone. i was the only black person in the restaurant. and in the 90’s, that felt very uncomfortable. now i tend to enjoy it at this age. i was having dinner with my agents, celebrating a deal that they told me was lucrative, but i later learned fucking sucked. and suddenly, a group of women walked by. every race was in that group. black, white, asian, latina, white, white… and white again. they were all gorgeous. i watched them walk by. then i saw a familiar face. al cowlings, the man from the infamous bronco chase, walked by and embraced one of the women, and they walked towards the door. couldn’t believe what i saw. and then, close behind him, was oj simpson, newly released from jail. the restaurant fell still. i was shocked. i didn’t mean to say it out loud, but it just came out. “oj!” he stopped, turned around to see who said it, saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me. i was sitting in the corner of the booth. he leaned over all the white people i was having dinner with and shook my hand. “how are you, young man?” he looked in my eyes, and i could see in his eyes that he didn’t remember meeting me the first time. and then he walked away. and i looked back at my agents, and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces. and the only one with the courage to voice their disgust was a woman named sharon who used to represent me. “how could you?” she said. “how could you shake hands with that murderer?” i said, “sharon, with all due respect, that murderer ran for over 11,000 yards. and he was acquitted. so, you know, fuck it. the glove didn’t fit. the glove didn’t fit. get over yourself.” some people can’t do that. some people just can’t get over themselves. gay people have a hard time doing that recently. here we go. here comes the deep water. no, recently i’ve noticed that. i noticed it with that manny pacquiao controversy. yeah, it was– now, in the gay community’s defense, manny pacquiao said some outlandish shit about gay people, very not nice things that i won’t repeat, but there was biblical verses and some analogies to animals. it wasn’t a good look. nike took his shoes immediately. which i thought was a little harsh. a little harsh, you know what i mean? just ’cause he’s asian. you know what i mean? how the fuck are you gonna take the shoes off an asian dude to appease a gay dude? you know what i mean? no? you don’t know what i mean. but asian people kind of know what i mean. no? no asians in the front? no? no, this is what i mean. look, you’re an asian dude– i say this with no disrespect. we’re all americans, right? and we can agree that america has a huge body count all over the world, but nowhere more than asia. literally, if you look at history, recently, we have bombed the masculinity out of an entire continent. we dropped two atomic bombs on fucking japan, and they’ve been drawing hello kitty and shit ever since. there’s a lot of lady-boys in the wake of our bombs. and i know these things because my wife is asian. she’s filipino. all right, okay. so, that explains it. now you know why you see me at all those filipino events. i’m not there picking up pussy. i’m dropping some off. i take my wife to all that shit. i took my wife to see pacquiao fight mayweather. we sat ringside, okay? that– yeah, that was a quiet car ride home, that’s what that was. but if you know what’s popping in the philippines, you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the philippines growing up without their mothers. yes. a lot of women in the philippines go to the arabian peninsula, they come to the united states, they make all their money here, they send all that money back home, which is still one of the number-one staples in the philippines’ economy– money that the expats send back to the philippines. the men, on the other hand, are left rearing children, twiddling their thumbs, waiting on their wives’ checks. these men have been fucking emasculated. and then suddenly, a boxer rises from amongst them and reinstates their manhood with his motherfucking fist. this is not the guy you’re supposed to ask, “what do you think of homosexuals?” he’s not your champ. shit. that’s why i don’t have a sneaker deal, ’cause if you say something that people don’t like, they’ll take your fucking shoes off. if martin luther king had a sneaker deal, we’d still be on the back of the bus. it’s true. the nike exec would come up– “hi, martin. uh… we need you to tone down the talk of civil rights and blacks being humans. it’s upsetting our southern distributors.” “but i don’t understand. i thought that’s why i had a sneaker deal in the first place.” “not quite. really, it’s a walking shoe. and we like the marching, but… try to understand.” fuck that shit. you know, i get it, though. i understand why gay people are mad, and i empathize. you know what? i’m just telling you this as a black dude. i support your movement. but if you want to take some advice from a negro, pace yourself. these things take a while. just ’cause they passed the law doesn’t mean they’re gonna like it. brown v. board of education was in. somebody called me a n i g g e r in traffic last wednesday. it takes a minute. my wife’s friend stewart told me that. my wife has a lot of gay friends. stewart’s their leader. she has a lot of gay friends. and i don’t like ’em. not ’cause they’re gay. i’m just judging them on the merits of their character. they’re just not nice dudes. they’re fucking rude houseguests. they’re sitting on my couch, giggling with my wife, eating my motherfucking macaroons. then i come in, and they act like the party’s over. “hey, stewart. what’s going on?” this guy talks to me the way a cat would speak if a cat could talk. “hi, david.” “stewart, what’s all the beef, man? what’s going–” he always wants to have some kind of gay political argument. the last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words “husband and wife” out of the law. i said, “why would you want those words out of the law?” he said, “because it discriminates against same-sex couples.” i was like, “n i g g a s, please, save me the semantics. just trust me. take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino. you’re about to crap out! just go outside, talk that over amongst yourselves, and whichever one of you is gayer, that’s the wife.” no, no. stewart didn’t like that. stewart educates me about this movement. i didn’t even know shit about it. he told me it’s called “lbgtq!” i was like, “what the fuck is the ‘q’?” does that even make sense? “q”? turns out “q” is like the vowels. that shit is sometimes “y.” it’s for gay dudes that don’t really know they’re gay. like prison fags who are like, “what? i’m not gay, n i g g a. i’m just sucking these dicks to pass the time. i’m not ‘g.’ i’m ‘q.’ ugh.” i think– okay, again, of all those letters, the “t” has the toughest road ahead. in fact, i think the “t” should stand for “tough road ahead.” they’ve got the longest mental gap to bridge. that’s all i’m saying. because whenever i see one of them ts on the street, i don’t mind them, but i’ll be like, “man, i miss bruce.” i’m sorry, guys. i’m 42. i remember bruce jenner. before the kardashians, before all that, this motherfucker was a white american superhero. it was amazing. he was beating africans at track and field. we’d never seen anything like it. he was on my cereal box growing up. you know how much of that cereal i ate? n i g g a, i didn’t know he was gonna do that. i knew before you guys knew. i heard things on the street in hollywood. you’d just be out, see people. “hey, what’s up, kanye? why the long face?” “n i g g a, you’ll see. i got two mother-in-laws now.” and when i heard he was gonna do it, i was scared. i didn’t think the public was ready. i didn’t think the media was ready. and you know what? i was wrong. not only did the public embrace him, but the media was nice. i’d never seen anything like it. “welcome to the world, caitlyn. so long, bruce. hello, caitlyn.” i was shocked! is this happening? wait a minute. is this a time in american history where an american can make a decision for themselves, and even though other americans don’t understand it, they’ll support it and let this person live a happy life? is this what’s happening? if it is, then good for america. that’s dave chappelle, the american. although, dave chappelle, the black american, he was a little jealous. i was like, “how the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination olympics?” if the police shot half as many transgenders as they did n i g g a s last year, there’d be a fucking war in la. i know black dudes in brooklyn– hard street motherfuckers– that wear high heels just to feel safe. transgenders are gangsters. i used to do business with a transgender in hollywood. man, everybody would be scared of her in the boardroom. she’d walk in there, newly-minted woman, high heels, purse. wouldn’t say anything to us, just walk around the conference table, looking mean and shit. then she’d walk to the head of the conference table, stare at us all, reach in her purse, pull her old dick out and throw it on the table. “let’s talk business, gentlemen.” “aaah!” shit is scary as fuck. if your best friend pitched that to you, you’d be horrified. “yo, n i g g a, let’s go to the hospital and cut our dicks off and make pussies out of them shits.” “what?! can’t we just get matching jackets or tattoos or something? you sure that’s what you want to do?” “there’s only way to find out, n i g g a. wu-tang! pow! pow! let’s go to the club and trick n i g g a s into fucking us. yeah.” the third time i met oj simpson— the third time i met oj simpson, i was doing great in life. i’d just finished the second season of chappelle’s show. man, those were good days. i was playing a comedy club in miami, the improv. i don’t know if you’ve ever been, but if you have, you’d know the door for the green room is right on the stage. can you imagine such a thing? if i walked out of the door of the green room, bam, i was right here, right from the dressing room. and i did that. i walked out, and the whole crowd was like, “hooray!” and i looked– ma’am, as close as you are to me– i saw him as soon as i came out: the juice. and i saw recognition in his eyes, and it filled me with pride that he knew who i was. i didn’t acknowledge his presence because it was a white audience, and i didn’t want to start a panic. but i did my show. the show went great. i said, “good night, everyone.” they all said, “yay!” and i didn’t say nothing to oj, but i just gave him the signal to let him know i knew he was there. and i walked into the green room, and oj was already in there! i was like, “how the fuck is this possible?” i was scared. and then my friends came in, and we all started talking. we sat down on the couch. and i’m just telling you what i saw with my own eyes. you can believe me or not believe me. but in my experience, oj simpson– one of the nicest men i’d ever met. he was nice to me. he was nice to my friends. the conversation was filled with warmth and levity, humor and wisdom. we talked for minutes, and then suddenly, the juice said, “you know what? i’ve got to be going. but it’s good to see you again, and i’m glad things went so well.” i said, “thanks, juice.” and my friends said, “yeah, goodbye, mr. juice.” they were new to the game. he said, “no. thank you… for your hospitality. good night, guys.“ and we said, “good night.” and he just walked out of the room. and as soon as the door closed, we all looked at each other like, “that n i g g a did that shit. did you feel that? i could feel like… murder in the room.” well, you young heads missed that shit. you’re all too young. you don’t remember that. -how old are you, young, man? you. -twenty-four. twenty-four? you don’t know shit. you don’t know shit! you gotta google shit that i lived through. see, this is why i lock motherfuckers’ phones up. seriously. because the young kids, you guys need to take a break from that– we all need to break just from that technology, just for a minute. you know, i’m from a different time, young man. a dark time to you. i’m from a time that i didn’t even used to know who was on the phone until i answered the shit. like, when tragedy used to strike. i remember i was 12 years old, and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom. you remember these days? and she turned it on to one of three channels. and she said, “class, the space shuttle is taking off, and we’re all gonna watch it take off.” man, that shit was going great for like, three to five minutes. that’s right. you remember. it fucking exploded! right on television. everybody on board, dead. immediately presumed dead. it was so bad, the teacher looked at all the kids and was like… “you can go home.” it was a goddamn national tragedy. this was cold war america. the russians were laughing at us. my point is, for a guy your age wouldn’t even know the pain, because in your generation, it’s like the space shuttle blows up every fucking day. how can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing? i’m getting over one cop shooting, and then another one happens, and then another one happens, and another one happens. i’m crying about paris, and then brussels happens. i can’t keep track of all this shit. so you just give the fuck up. that’s the hallmark of your generation, and that’s fucked up, because your generation lives in the most difficult time in human history. this is the age of spin. the age where nobody knows what the fuck they’re even looking at. did you know that planned parenthood was for abortions? it’s for people that don’t plan things out at all. that’s right. so, a guy your age doesn’t really know how he feels. are you pro-choice? are you anti-consequences? what does it all really mean? it’s easier not to care for you. but for us, we were trained to care. we were raised that way. i used to watch a fucking cartoon when i was growing up called care bears. it was about a fucking group of teddy-bear people. they were like teddy bears, but they were like people, and they were all different colors, and they all fucking just walked around, caring. they cared about each other and everything else. they all had different designs on their stomachs, and the designs told you something about what they might be like inside. very, very loving group of beings. and when shit got real bad, as nice as those teddy bears were, they didn’t get mean faces. they got determined. hmm! and the leader would say, “come on, guys. it’s time for the care bear stare!” remember that shit? and them little teddy bears would lock arms… and stare at the problem– and i’m not even bullshitting– actual love would shoot out of their chests… and would dispel anything that was fucked up. and when we grew up, we wanted to be like those bears. and then we got our hearts broken, because we found out that life wasn’t gonna let us do that and that it’s impossible to shoot love out of your chest. however, i have shot love onto somebody’s chest before. i do it all the time. it’s the next best thing. you kids don’t know. your generation is just determined to be angry, mad. everybody’s mad. back when we were growing up, only black people were mad. now everybody’s just trying to get in on the act. i try to think to myself, “when did everyone get mad?” and then i realize this happened before we were born. this is a long way to go, but… it probably started in the second world war. think about it. all these black men, millions of black men, leave the united states for the first time, go over to europe with america’s armed forces and fight the nazis and make more money fighting nazis than they ever dreamed they would make in the united states. and a lot of those men, while they were in europe– just to be real, not to be crass– a lot of them probably got their dicks sucked by white women. i’m sorry, ladies and gentlemen. this was world war ii europe, and these were desperate times, and penises were being sucked for shoelaces and chocolate and very frivolous things. and it’s very hard to come back to america and sit on the back of the bus after you’ve been in the south of france, getting your dick sucked for a crunch bar or some crazy shit like that. that’s a life-changing experience. and while that was happening in europe, here in america, for the first time, women entered the workforce en masse, by the millions. all the men were gone. someone had to run the factory. the ladies did it. that’s right. this was the first generation of american women to have independent income en masse, and when the men came back, the women weren’t the same. american women had grown. they were uttering phrases that no woman on earth had ever spoken before, things like, “no” and “shut the fuck up” and “i don’t feel like it.” and then behind the scenes of that, there was a little-known government agency that started testing mind control drugs on the american public. they fucked up. they tested it for 12 years. they didn’t realize these drugs were not mind-controlling. they were mind-expanding. it was lsd and mescaline and shit like that. and for the first time, there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question the very society they lived in. by 1960, the president of the united states was only 42 years old. can you imagine? dmx is older than that. and he was gonna usher in a new era of peace. he was gonna avoid the cold war. he was gonna end segregation. and they blew his fucking brains out in front of everyone in dallas. this country was never the same. there were seven more major assassinations in the ’60s. anyone that stood up and said anything was shot down in the streets like a fucking dog. kennedy, kennedy, king, x, evers, on and on. you didn’t even have to be famous. you could be a college student at kent state, or in mississippi, protesting the vietnam war, and they shot them, too. the ’70s were a wild era. and while all this was going on… bill cosby raped 54 people. holy shit. that’s a lot of rapes, man. this guy’s putting up real numbers. he’s like the steph curry of rape. man, that’s a lot of rapes. fifty-four? if he had raped less people… that’s still two dozen rapes! don’t forget, each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it. ladies and gentlemen, that’s over hours of rape. it only takes hours to get a pilot’s license. if rapes were aircrafts, this n i g g a is top gun for sure. yeah, that’s a tough one. and i was onstage not too long ago. i was in syracuse, new york. yeah. well, yeah, for syracuse. but the show didn’t go so good… all because i was talking about bill cosby a little bit. not a little bit. i’ll be honest. i talked about him for like, minutes. and a woman stood up in the back of the room, and she screamed out, “you are a fucking asshole for saying these things!” “i know.” instantly, i felt bad. not bad about what i was saying. i just felt bad like, “oh, that’s too bad she doesn’t like the show.” i didn’t realize it at first, but not only did she say that, she was rushing the stage. by the time i saw her, i just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode. i was horrified. i said, “oh, my god! i’m gonna kick this bitch in the face.” lucky for me, i didn’t have to. security tackled her. but it was a really fucking horrifying scene. a scuffle ensued. and then, finally, she screamed out to me, “women suffer!” i said, “i know.” and, ladies, i need you to know… that i know. i need you to know. seriously, there’s a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists. i would include myself in that. don’t ever forget, we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives, and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender. there’s a lot of men like that in this room. there’s a lot of men like that in the world. or as we are known on the streets, bitch-ass n i g g a s. but as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me, i started to take offense. and i’ll be honest, race was involved. she was a young white woman. well-intentioned, but just not thinking it all the way through. “bitch, how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination?” she didn’t get it. she just kept going. “women suffer!” “i know.” “women suffer!” “same team.” “women suffer!” “i know.” and this is when she went too far: “we suffer just like you.” “slow your roll, bitch. you suffer, yes, but not like me. not like us.” she goes, “suffering is suffering. what’s the difference?” i said, “come on, white woman, you know what it is. you was in on the heist. you just don’t like your cut.” you suffer, i suffer. you suffer, i suffer. that’s how it works. can’t do comparative suffering. if you’re hungry, and your friend says, “you know, people are starving in africa,” “so what, n i g g a? i still want lunch.” black people know about comparative suffering, and you know that it’s a fucking dead-end game. blacks and jews do that shit to each other all the time. you ever played who suffered more with a jewish person? it’s a tough game. whenever you think you’ve got the jewish guy on the ropes, that motherfucker will be like, “well, don’t forget about egypt.” “egypt?! god damn, n i g g a, i didn’t know we was going all the way back to egypt.” what the fuck is wrong with her? what does she think? does she think that i don’t know that rape is wrong? does she think that maybe i don’t have empathy for bill cosby’s alleged victims? and i would be remiss if i didn’t remind you that technically these are all still allegations. although, i admit it looks very bad. perhaps if she looked at it correctly, she would have empathy for me, the man she was attacking, a 42-year-old black comedian. obviously, bill cosby was a hero to me. and she doesn’t know what it feels like to think that your hero might’ve done something so heinous, my god, you can’t imagine. it’d be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself… had raped 54 people. you’d say to yourself, “oh, man, but i like chocolate ice cream. i don’t want it to rape.” didn’t want to believe it. at first, i didn’t believe it. i said, “these people are obviously trying to destroy dr. cosby’s rich legacy.” even 34 allegations into it, i was still like, “man… he probably only raped ten or 11 of those people.” i know, i know. but it’s really tough. you guys are young. imagine if you found out 40 years from now that kevin hart raped 54 people. you’d be like, “oh, my god.” the only one that would believe that would be katt williams. he’d be like, “i knew that motherfucker was up to something! i knew kevin had raped those people.” you know, i was mad at kevin, too, though. you know why? okay, first of all, i didn’t even know kevin was as successful as he was. i found that shit out the hard way. i was at home when my son busted in. he said, “dad, i need $250.” he’s only years old, so i freaked out. “what’s going on, n i g g a? is somebody trying to kill you?” he said, “no, no. kevin hart’s coming to town, and i wanted to see his show.” i said, “how much are the tickets?” he said, “they’re $125.” i said, “god damn! mine are only 80.” i said, “why do you need $250, then?” he goes, “because i want to go with you, dad. please? and there it is. so, i took him to the show. and we go, we sit right up front. the lights go down, and one opening act after another goes on. then kevin takes the stage. the crowd goes fucking nuts. thousands of people. i was furious. the longer the show went on, the madder i got. because his show was fucking outstanding. it was maddening. these people were fucking holding their stomachs. my son was slapping his knee. i’m like, “damn, n i g g a, i do this, too.” kevin says, “good night.” the crowd goes crazy. and then everyone starts walking to his door, and the lights come on, and then my son is just standing there, looking at an empty stage. people are pushing past me, and nobody’s recognizing me. i’m like, “man, this place fucking sucks!” i said, “come on, son, let’s get out of here.” then my son looks back at me and says, “dad, please. please, i have to meet him.” i was like, “oh, my god.” so, i took him backstage. i’ve known kevin for years, but can you believe i was scared to knock on his dressing room door? i almost said… “son, i haven’t seen him for a long time.” and one of kevin’s goons opened the door. “hey, what’s up, dave chappelle? what are you doing, man? it’s good to see you, brother. what are you doing in this area? this is a terrible area.” i’m like, “actually, i live around here. listen… is kevin here? my son just wanted to meet him real quick.” “i don’t know, ’cause kevin’s about to eat dinner.” just then, kevin came around the corner to see who it was. “what? oh, shit! what’s up, dave? come on back. i was just about to have dinner. i don’t know if you guys ate, but you’re welcome to join me if you’d like.” and then my son pushed passed me. it was some cold shit. he goes, “actually, mr. hart, we haven’t eaten in several hours.” man, kevin took us into his back room. this guy had a fucking spread. it was tuesday night. this motherfucker was having sunday dinner. there were steaks, chops, corn with butter all over it. my son was eating all fast, embarrassing me. i was like, “slow down, son.” he was like… then i looked over in the corner, and there was a box of custom-made jerseys for the local team. each one was hand-stitched, and on the back, they stitched on “k-hart” on all of them. kevin saw me staring at that box, and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys, and he walked right to my son. he said, “hey, little man. i want you to have this.” and my son was like, “thanks, mr. hart.” this is when i got mad. he goes, “if your father ever makes you mad, put that on.” and he walked out. oh, that was some cold shit. then i realized– i looked up what kevin made on google. i couldn’t believe that shit. kevin is the first comedian that a drake song could be about. kevin could walk around his house and sing “all me,” and the whole song would still be true. “♪ got everything, i got everything ♪\n",
            "♪ i cannot complain, i cannot ♪\n",
            "♪ i don’t even know how much i really made ♪\n",

            "♪ fuck that, never mind what i got ♪” and his wife will be like, “kevin, come to bed!” he’ll be like… “♪ ho, shut the fuck up ♪ ♪ i got way too much– ♪” you know how much money you have to have to tell a girl to shut the fuck up? i have “quiet, please” money at best. i’d have to take a loan out for “shut the fuck up.” “shut the fuck up–” that’s jay z money. and beyoncé got “no, you shut the fuck up” money. let’s not forget. let’s not forget. i’ve never met bill cosby, so i’m not defending him. let’s just remember that he has a valuable legacy that i can’t just throw away. i remember that he’s the first black man to ever win an emmy in television. i also remember that he’s the first guy to make a cartoon with black characters where their lips and noses were drawn proportionately. i remember that he had a television show that got numbers equivalent to the super bowl every thursday night. and i remember that he partnered up with a clinical psychologist to make sure that there was not one negative image of african-americans on his show. i’m telling you, that’s no small thing. i’ve had a television show. i wouldn’t have done that shit. he gave tens of millions of dollars to african-american institutions of higher learning, and is directly responsible for thousands of black kids going to college. not just the ones he raped. here comes the kicker. you ready? here’s the fact that i heard, but haven’t confirmed. i heard that when martin luther king stood on the steps of the lincoln memorial and said he had a dream, he was speaking into a pa system that bill cosby paid for. so, you understand what i’m saying? the point is this: he rapes, but he saves. and he saves more than he rapes. but he probably does rape. thank you very much! good night! ♪ ah-ah, ah-ah ♪\n",

            "♪ ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah ♪ ♪ in every ghetto ♪ wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! i forgot. the fourth time i met oj simpson. the fourth time is not the funniest time, but it was the last time i’d see the juice. for some reason, i was at the kentucky derby. it’s a very long story. this is right after i quit chappelle’s show in spectacular fashion. there was a party hosted by michael jordan, and every athlete i’ve ever admired was in that room. yes. and then i saw a familiar face by the bar, standing there, drinking alone. it was chris tucker. now… you have to remember, at this time, we were both technically missing. and we went over, and we’re talking with one another, and motherfuckers were amazed to see us together. seeing me and chris tucker at that point would be like seeing bigfoot riding a unicorn. you wouldn’t believe that’s what you were seeing. and then, through all the gawkers, a familiar face pushed through the crowd. here he was again. the juice. he had his camera ready. he was like, “dave, chris. good to see you guys. hey, come on, guys. let’s all get together for a picture.” and at the same time, me and chris were like, “no. i can’t do that. sorry, juice, my career is too flimsy to survive a picture with you.” that’s the end. good night. ♪ ah-ah, ah-ah ♪\n",

            "♪ ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah ♪ thank you! thank you very much! thank you all. oh, wow. that was exciting, wasn’t it? thank you, guys. have a seat, feel comfortable, relax. i want to thank everyone in la for a wonderful week. it’s been great here. you know what? it’s been ten years since the last time i played los angeles, if you can imagine. i know! i know, i’ve been gone for a very long time. and unbeknownst to you, it was a difficult ten years. i’m not gonna take you through all the agony i’ve been through, but it was tough. some of it you might’ve seen. i don’t know if you ever saw on tmz the big headline: “dave chappelle drunk onstage in detroit.” well, if you saw it, i wasn’t drunk. i had smoked some reefer… with some rappers. yeah. i don’t know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers, but their weed is very strong, stronger than i what i was accustomed to. the article goes on to say i was booed offstage, which is also incorrect. i was booed. i did not leave. it was a long bomb. it was a fucking nightmare. two puffs of weed, that’s all it was. two puffs. i never had that happen, where i take two puffs of weed, i looked at the guy next to me, i was like, “i’m gonna bomb, n i g g a. i can feel it.” and that guy called my name. “dave chappelle!” n i g g a s was like… normally, when you do a comedy show– you guys don’t know what it looks like up here, but n i g g a s be just looking up at you like… that’s how the show started. didn’t take long for their faces to switch up like, “what the fuck?” they started looking amongst themselves. so i knew i wasn’t doing good. i don’t remember what i was saying. it just took one person to break the ice. it was a black lady with a ford motor shirt on. stood up suddenly. “fuck you, dave chappelle!” i said, “excuse me?” she said, “i worked all week for this shit, and this show sucks!” and in a weird act of racial harmony, a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up. “yeah!” the whole crowd banded together and started chanting, “we want our money back! we want our money back!” i said, “oh, shit.” i snapped out of it. “good people of detroit, hear me. hear me now. you will never get your fucking money back.” fuck that. i said, “i’m like evel knievel. i get paid for the attempt. i didn’t promise this shit would be good.” “boo!” they said, “fuck you!” this went on for a long time. and then, after the show, i felt so bad, i took half of the money from the show– thousands of dollars– i said, “i’m gonna give this to charity.” you know what i did? i bought $25,000 worth of bubble gum and drove around detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry. i was very mad at detroit that night. because not only did i bomb, i had to go back to the very same room the next night and do it all over again. fucking nightmare. that would be like if you were having sex with a woman and, for some reason– this would never happen– but for some reason, she had a mousetrap in her pussy. you get caught in the trap. and then you’ve got to fuck her again tomorrow night. i’d still do it, but i’d be careful the next time. the old mousetrap-in-the-pussy trick, eh? fool me once. yeah. yeah, it was a tough time. and i wanted to give up sometimes. i almost did give up, but then, right before i gave up, i decided not to. but i made the call. they answered the phone. “hello? dancing with the stars.” i said, “not yet. not yet.” yeah. if you see me on that shit, it’s over. trust me. my spirit is broken. if you see me waiting for them judges… getting critiqued on my cha-cha, fuck that. i’ve been hanging out in– i haven’t been working in la, but i come out here and hang out and shit. i was out here a few weeks ago. i almost got arrested. i’m not bullshitting. this happens to a lot of black people. what happened was… i was coming out of one of those nightclubs in hollywood, and my friend saw me. i guess i was wobbling or something. so, he just rolled up. he’s a good friend of mine. he’s like, “hey, dave, give me the keys.” i was like, “all right, n i g g a, just take the keys.” and i got in the passenger’s side of my car, and he drove it. it was fine. just talking, chopping it up. and then, on the 10, the blue-and-whites hit us. now, i should tell you, the friend that was driving me was black, which really doesn’t have anything to do with the story other than to let you know there was fear in the car. not my fear. i’m black, but i’m also dave chappelle. so, i figured, you know, shit will probably be fine. traffic stop started off on the right foot. the cops came up to the driver’s side. “hi. how are you guys doing tonight?” and he recognized me immediately. “oh. dave chappelle.” and i looked at my friend like, “we’re getting out of this shit.” and then he says, “you guys were swerving in the lane. do you mind just stepping out of the car for a second?” still no cause for alarm. i looked through the rearview mirror. the body language of the arrest looked good. just talking. so, then i started fucking with the radio. you know a traffic stop is going good if you’re listening to the radio when someone else is outside of the car. but then, when i looked back in the rearview mirror, something had gone horribly wrong. that motherfucker was back there like… and the next thing i knew, they were stuffing him in the back of the car, and i thought what anybody would think in a situation like that: “oh, my god. what is gonna happen to me?” and the police walked up to the window. “mr. chappelle, we had to arrest your friend. he refused to take our breathalyzer test.” i said, “that motherfucker. not complying? that’s odd. so, officer, what’s gonna happen to me?” “you’re fine. we’re just gonna have to ask you to step out of the car so we can impound the vehicle, and we’ll arrange for you to have a ride home.” i said, “oh, well, no. i would rather you just give me the keys.” he said, “mr. chappelle, your friend already told us he’s your designated driver. we can’t let you drive in this condition.” i was like, “no, n i g g a, i’m good.” and then suddenly, the shit turned into vegas. he was like… “i’ll let you blow for it.” i said, “excuse me?” he said, “if you blow in my breathalyzer–” i said, “oh, n i g g a, i thought you was trying to get your dick sucked. what’s the– whew! whew!” “if you blow in my breathalyzer and pass, i’ll give you the keys to the car.” i said, “uh… set ’em up, n i g g a. let’s play.” and i blew in that thing. and it made a noise. “beep!” i said, “uh-oh.” and he looked at it. he said, “oh, well, mr. chappelle, i guess you’re free to go.” i said, “i am?” i didn’t know that thing didn’t pick up weed. i drove home on the miles an hour. yeah, it all worked out. it all worked out. i’m one of the lucky ones. it doesn’t work out that well for everybody. i saw that videotape of that lady that got beat up in la in traffic. you see that shit on rush hour traffic? they beat a black woman’s ass. this woman didn’t even do anything wrong. it’s fucked up. it was so fucked up, it didn’t even go to court. the city of l.a. just gave that woman $1.5 million for her pain and suffering. that is not bad, considering that’s the same amount of money that marcos maidana made to fight floyd mayweather the second time. and this woman obviously hasn’t trained a day in her life. you can see it on the tape. she didn’t come to fight. her guards were low. she was taking a lot of shots. everybody’s mad at police now. i watched that– you see that shit on netflix, making a murderer? the steven avery story. if you haven’t seen it, check it out. steven avery is in more trouble than any white person in the history of the united states has ever been in! in a justice system designed for him to thrive, he’s failed miserably twice. i can’t even wrap my mind around it. if making a murderer was about a black dude, that shit would be called duh! of course everything would go wrong. seems like he did it, all right. the motherfucker even had $200,000 for his legal defense. that should get you off in wisconsin. that’s like oj money. all he needed to get off that he didn’t have was a single black juror. that’s all it would’ve took. because only a black dude in the united states can look at other dudes and be like, “i think the police did this shit.” he’s fucked up in the game. that’s how oj got off. i’ve been watching that new oj show. i can’t get enough of that shit. doesn’t it bring back good memories? but i forgot just how polarizing that oj case was. and you know, i’ve met oj simpson on four different occasions in my life. and before the end of the show, i will tell you about each of those occasions. the first time i met oj simpson, i was in santa monica. -santa monica! -yeah! i can’t believe a black dude was like, “santa monica!” you the last n i g g a i would expect to say that. let me see your shoes. you got some vans on, n i g g a? what you got? “santa monica!” you? at the time, i was . i had done a show, and the guy from the club came up and was like, “hey, oj simpson’s here, and he said he wants to meet you.” i said, “what? fuck yeah!” i ran down the steps, and oj was down there. he’s like, “hey, young man. how are you? it’s very good to meet you. and you’re doing really good work, and i hope good things happen for you in your life.” i was like, “man, thanks, mr. juice.” standing beside him, was– i don’t know the nice way to say this– his soon-to-be-slain wife. ladies and gentlemen, man the fuck up, or you’re not gonna make it to the end of this show. just man the fuck up. she’s dead. we already know what happened. we don’t know who did it, but we know what happened. i should tell you, that woman was very nice to me. she actually embraced me. she said, “i think you’re adorable,” and she hugged me. she goes, “good luck to you,” and she held me for a long time. and i whispered in her ear, “bitch, are you trying to get us both killed?” i’m just kidding. i didn’t say that, but… that was the first time, in a nutshell. it’s good to see so many… so many different people here from so many different ethnicities. very diverse crowd. looks like you thought bernie sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker. but… surprise! it’s me. yeah. yeah, you know, i’m happy, really, to see black people come. a lot of black people don’t fuck with me like they used to. but there’s a few reasons you don’t see black people at my shows. one is because, obviously, black people have slower internet connections. i mean, that would be my guess. i don’t know what– actually, my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community i hold so dear. a couple of weeks ago, i was supposed to be in flint, michigan, for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in flint. i don’t know if you know this, but the water in flint is fucking poisonous. it’s actually making people sick. hollywood people are like, “so what? at least they have water.” but this water– this water is fucked up. so, a lot of black celebrities flew into flint, and they did a tremendous charity benefit, and i was on the schedule to appear. uh… so, the reason a lot of people haven’t heard about this benefit– it was the same day as the oscars. right, i know. so, i was on my way to the airport to go to flint, and then chris rock calls me and is like, “hey, dave, i got a ticket for you for the oscars. can you make it?” and i was like, “sure, n i g g a. i’m on my way to the airport right now.” come on, man. what am i gonna do about that water? what am i, a fucking superhero? i need to have fun. i need to live, too! i didn’t fuck that water up! stevie wonder was there. they didn’t need me. i’m sorry, everybody. i’d never been to the oscars. you’ve seen the movies i make. i was excited. i knew i was gonna get into some trouble, because when i was walking on the red carpet, the black press came after me. “excuse me, brother.” when you hear somebody call you “brother” too much, something terrible is about to happen. “excuse me, brother. brother?” and i looked back, and the motherfucker had a tuxedo with the kente cloth tie. i said, “uh-oh.” he said, “i just want to ask you a couple questions.” i said, “what publication are you with?” he said, “me? i’m with the daily bongo.” i said, “daily bongo? what the fuck? who the fuck reads this?” he said, “listen, brother, i just want to ask you a quick question. you understand that this year, this is a boycott for the oscars. so, i’m just wondering what made you, of all people, cross the motherfucking picket line and be here tonight.” i said, “boycott? n i g g a, i haven’t been working in ten years. what do you mean, boycott? i’ve been on strike. y’all n i g g a s didn’t stop working. i had to watch fucking key and peele do my show every night! so, fuck the daily bongo,” is what i said. i went to the oscars and had a wonderful time. i went in that fucking green room. it was filled with so many stars, i couldn’t even believe what i was seeing. hollywood was seducing me all over again. i was sitting back there. i’m smoking, drinking with the stars. and then two hollywood movie producers came over, right to me. “oh, my god. dave chappelle,” said the leader one. he was obviously gay. some guys, you can just tell. the other one seemed like a money guy. maybe he was from texas or some shit. but the gay one was definitely the leader because he did all the talking. and then he hit me with: “so, david, um… do you have any movie ideas that you would like to pursue?” the truth is, i don’t. but if you know the game, you’re not supposed to tell motherfuckers you don’t have ideas. i was like, “yeah, man. i got plenty of ideas.” and he called my bluff. “really? like what?” “huh? oh. um… um…” and then i just started making up shit that i thought maybe he’d like to see. i said, “i have a superhero idea.” he goes, “really?” i go, “yeah. he’s a– he’s a gay superhero.” he was like, “really?! what’s it called?” “huh? oh, it’s called– it’s called same hero, new boots. it’s about a gay sous-chef in san francisco… that gets bit by a radioactive rat on his shift when he’s taking out the trash and is blessed with powers beyond his wildest dreams, supersonic gay kind of powers. and he starts saving everybody in san francisco. but at first, he only saves gay people. later, he saves everybody, and the whole city just falls in love with him. the only problem is, no one remembers him when he saves them.” “well, i don’t understand. why wouldn’t they remember him?” i said, “because, dummy, he’s gay. he keeps changing his outfit. people come up– ‘thanks for saving me, sir. what’s your name anyway?’ he’s like, ‘same hero, new boots!’ and that motherfucker flies away.” he was like, “i like it a lot.” the texan didn’t like that shit at all. he was upset. “that’s impossible, a gay superhero.” i said, “what? well, i have others. i have a superhero you’d love, ’cause he’s stronger than superman and he fights for truth, justice and the american way, like superman, but more than superman. he beats up mexicans for no reason.” the texan’s like, “you got my attention.” i’m like, “man, this motherfucker’s so strong, he can fly and do all this great shit. only problem with this guy is he can’t even activate his powers unless he touches– unless he touches a woman’s vagina. not a long touch, just a couple of pats.” he said, “well, what’s the problem with that?” i said, “the problem, sir, is that our hero is not a handsome man. and he’s often short on cash. so, whenever trouble breaks out, he has to run around the city and convince women to let him pat their vaginas. ‘please, miss! that building’s on fire. can i pat your vagina? quickly. people are dying!’ but he can’t tell them exactly why. ‘eww! get away! you’re gross!’ ‘please, miss! people are dying! just a couple of pats!’ ‘eww! gross! get away!’ so, he rapes them. i know, i know. that’s the dilemma for the audience. because he rapes, but he saves a lot of lives. and he saves way more than he rapes, and he only rapes to save. but he does rape.” i didn’t realize it, but the whole green room was looking at us. all the celebrities were disgusted. “ohh.” that guy from texas was like, “here’s my card. call me on monday.” that worked out. the second time i met oj simpson. it was right after the trial of the century. there i was, now a young man of probably 23. oj simpson was the most famous, or infamous, face on planet earth. i was in a restaurant in beverly hills with my agents. i wasn’t alone in the restaurant, but i was alone. i was the only black person in the restaurant. and in the 90’s, that felt very uncomfortable. now i tend to enjoy it at this age. i was having dinner with my agents, celebrating a deal that they told me was lucrative, but i later learned fucking sucked. and suddenly, a group of women walked by. every race was in that group. black, white, asian, latina, white, white… and white again. they were all gorgeous. i watched them walk by. then i saw a familiar face. al cowlings, the man from the infamous bronco chase, walked by and embraced one of the women, and they walked towards the door. couldn’t believe what i saw. and then, close behind him, was oj simpson, newly released from jail. the restaurant fell still. i was shocked. i didn’t mean to say it out loud, but it just came out. “oj!” he stopped, turned around to see who said it, saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me. i was sitting in the corner of the booth. he leaned over all the white people i was having dinner with and shook my hand. “how are you, young man?” he looked in my eyes, and i could see in his eyes that he didn’t remember meeting me the first time. and then he walked away. and i looked back at my agents, and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces. and the only one with the courage to voice their disgust was a woman named sharon who used to represent me. “how could you?” she said. “how could you shake hands with that murderer?” i said, “sharon, with all due respect, that murderer ran for over 11,000 yards. and he was acquitted. so, you know, fuck it. the glove didn’t fit. the glove didn’t fit. get over yourself.” some people can’t do that. some people just can’t get over themselves. gay people have a hard time doing that recently. here we go. here comes the deep water. no, recently i’ve noticed that. i noticed it with that manny pacquiao controversy. yeah, it was– now, in the gay community’s defense, manny pacquiao said some outlandish shit about gay people, very not nice things that i won’t repeat, but there was biblical verses and some analogies to animals. it wasn’t a good look. nike took his shoes immediately. which i thought was a little harsh. a little harsh, you know what i mean? just ’cause he’s asian. you know what i mean? how the fuck are you gonna take the shoes off an asian dude to appease a gay dude? you know what i mean? no? you don’t know what i mean. but asian people kind of know what i mean. no? no asians in the front? no? no, this is what i mean. look, you’re an asian dude– i say this with no disrespect. we’re all americans, right? and we can agree that america has a huge body count all over the world, but nowhere more than asia. literally, if you look at history, recently, we have bombed the masculinity out of an entire continent. we dropped two atomic bombs on fucking japan, and they’ve been drawing hello kitty and shit ever since. there’s a lot of lady-boys in the wake of our bombs. and i know these things because my wife is asian. she’s filipino. all right, okay. so, that explains it. now you know why you see me at all those filipino events. i’m not there picking up pussy. i’m dropping some off. i take my wife to all that shit. i took my wife to see pacquiao fight mayweather. we sat ringside, okay? that– yeah, that was a quiet car ride home, that’s what that was. but if you know what’s popping in the philippines, you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the philippines growing up without their mothers. yes. a lot of women in the philippines go to the arabian peninsula, they come to the united states, they make all their money here, they send all that money back home, which is still one of the number-one staples in the philippines’ economy– money that the expats send back to the philippines. the men, on the other hand, are left rearing children, twiddling their thumbs, waiting on their wives’ checks. these men have been fucking emasculated. and then suddenly, a boxer rises from amongst them and reinstates their manhood with his motherfucking fist. this is not the guy you’re supposed to ask, “what do you think of homosexuals?” he’s not your champ. shit. that’s why i don’t have a sneaker deal, ’cause if you say something that people don’t like, they’ll take your fucking shoes off. if martin luther king had a sneaker deal, we’d still be on the back of the bus. it’s true. the nike exec would come up– “hi, martin. uh… we need you to tone down the talk of civil rights and blacks being humans. it’s upsetting our southern distributors.” “but i don’t understand. i thought that’s why i had a sneaker deal in the first place.” “not quite. really, it’s a walking shoe. and we like the marching, but… try to understand.” fuck that shit. you know, i get it, though. i understand why gay people are mad, and i empathize. you know what? i’m just telling you this as a black dude. i support your movement. but if you want to take some advice from a negro, pace yourself. these things take a while. just ’cause they passed the law doesn’t mean they’re gonna like it. brown v. board of education was in. somebody called me a n i g g e r in traffic last wednesday. it takes a minute. my wife’s friend stewart told me that. my wife has a lot of gay friends. stewart’s their leader. she has a lot of gay friends. and i don’t like ’em. not ’cause they’re gay. i’m just judging them on the merits of their character. they’re just not nice dudes. they’re fucking rude houseguests. they’re sitting on my couch, giggling with my wife, eating my motherfucking macaroons. then i come in, and they act like the party’s over. “hey, stewart. what’s going on?” this guy talks to me the way a cat would speak if a cat could talk. “hi, david.” “stewart, what’s all the beef, man? what’s going–” he always wants to have some kind of gay political argument. the last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words “husband and wife” out of the law. i said, “why would you want those words out of the law?” he said, “because it discriminates against same-sex couples.” i was like, “n i g g a s, please, save me the semantics. just trust me. take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino. you’re about to crap out! just go outside, talk that over amongst yourselves, and whichever one of you is gayer, that’s the wife.” no, no. stewart didn’t like that. stewart educates me about this movement. i didn’t even know shit about it. he told me it’s called “lbgtq!” i was like, “what the fuck is the ‘q’?” does that even make sense? “q”? turns out “q” is like the vowels. that shit is sometimes “y.” it’s for gay dudes that don’t really know they’re gay. like prison fags who are like, “what? i’m not gay, n i g g a. i’m just sucking these dicks to pass the time. i’m not ‘g.’ i’m ‘q.’ ugh.” i think– okay, again, of all those letters, the “t” has the toughest road ahead. in fact, i think the “t” should stand for “tough road ahead.” they’ve got the longest mental gap to bridge. that’s all i’m saying. because whenever i see one of them ts on the street, i don’t mind them, but i’ll be like, “man, i miss bruce.” i’m sorry, guys. i’m 42. i remember bruce jenner. before the kardashians, before all that, this motherfucker was a white american superhero. it was amazing. he was beating africans at track and field. we’d never seen anything like it. he was on my cereal box growing up. you know how much of that cereal i ate? n i g g a, i didn’t know he was gonna do that. i knew before you guys knew. i heard things on the street in hollywood. you’d just be out, see people. “hey, what’s up, kanye? why the long face?” “n i g g a, you’ll see. i got two mother-in-laws now.” and when i heard he was gonna do it, i was scared. i didn’t think the public was ready. i didn’t think the media was ready. and you know what? i was wrong. not only did the public embrace him, but the media was nice. i’d never seen anything like it. “welcome to the world, caitlyn. so long, bruce. hello, caitlyn.” i was shocked! is this happening? wait a minute. is this a time in american history where an american can make a decision for themselves, and even though other americans don’t understand it, they’ll support it and let this person live a happy life? is this what’s happening? if it is, then good for america. that’s dave chappelle, the american. although, dave chappelle, the black american, he was a little jealous. i was like, “how the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination olympics?” if the police shot half as many transgenders as they did n i g g a s last year, there’d be a fucking war in la. i know black dudes in brooklyn– hard street motherfuckers– that wear high heels just to feel safe. transgenders are gangsters. i used to do business with a transgender in hollywood. man, everybody would be scared of her in the boardroom. she’d walk in there, newly-minted woman, high heels, purse. wouldn’t say anything to us, just walk around the conference table, looking mean and shit. then she’d walk to the head of the conference table, stare at us all, reach in her purse, pull her old dick out and throw it on the table. “let’s talk business, gentlemen.” “aaah!” shit is scary as fuck. if your best friend pitched that to you, you’d be horrified. “yo, n i g g a, let’s go to the hospital and cut our dicks off and make pussies out of them shits.” “what?! can’t we just get matching jackets or tattoos or something? you sure that’s what you want to do?” “there’s only way to find out, n i g g a. wu-tang! pow! pow! let’s go to the club and trick n i g g a s into fucking us. yeah.” the third time i met oj simpson— the third time i met oj simpson, i was doing great in life. i’d just finished the second season of chappelle’s show. man, those were good days. i was playing a comedy club in miami, the improv. i don’t know if you’ve ever been, but if you have, you’d know the door for the green room is right on the stage. can you imagine such a thing? if i walked out of the door of the green room, bam, i was right here, right from the dressing room. and i did that. i walked out, and the whole crowd was like, “hooray!” and i looked– ma’am, as close as you are to me– i saw him as soon as i came out: the juice. and i saw recognition in his eyes, and it filled me with pride that he knew who i was. i didn’t acknowledge his presence because it was a white audience, and i didn’t want to start a panic. but i did my show. the show went great. i said, “good night, everyone.” they all said, “yay!” and i didn’t say nothing to oj, but i just gave him the signal to let him know i knew he was there. and i walked into the green room, and oj was already in there! i was like, “how the fuck is this possible?” i was scared. and then my friends came in, and we all started talking. we sat down on the couch. and i’m just telling you what i saw with my own eyes. you can believe me or not believe me. but in my experience, oj simpson– one of the nicest men i’d ever met. he was nice to me. he was nice to my friends. the conversation was filled with warmth and levity, humor and wisdom. we talked for minutes, and then suddenly, the juice said, “you know what? i’ve got to be going. but it’s good to see you again, and i’m glad things went so well.” i said, “thanks, juice.” and my friends said, “yeah, goodbye, mr. juice.” they were new to the game. he said, “no. thank you… for your hospitality. good night, guys.“ and we said, “good night.” and he just walked out of the room. and as soon as the door closed, we all looked at each other like, “that n i g g a did that shit. did you feel that? i could feel like… murder in the room.” well, you young heads missed that shit. you’re all too young. you don’t remember that. -how old are you, young, man? you. -twenty-four. twenty-four? you don’t know shit. you don’t know shit! you gotta google shit that i lived through. see, this is why i lock motherfuckers’ phones up. seriously. because the young kids, you guys need to take a break from that– we all need to break just from that technology, just for a minute. you know, i’m from a different time, young man. a dark time to you. i’m from a time that i didn’t even used to know who was on the phone until i answered the shit. like, when tragedy used to strike. i remember i was 12 years old, and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom. you remember these days? and she turned it on to one of three channels. and she said, “class, the space shuttle is taking off, and we’re all gonna watch it take off.” man, that shit was going great for like, three to five minutes. that’s right. you remember. it fucking exploded! right on television. everybody on board, dead. immediately presumed dead. it was so bad, the teacher looked at all the kids and was like… “you can go home.” it was a goddamn national tragedy. this was cold war america. the russians were laughing at us. my point is, for a guy your age wouldn’t even know the pain, because in your generation, it’s like the space shuttle blows up every fucking day. how can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing? i’m getting over one cop shooting, and then another one happens, and then another one happens, and another one happens. i’m crying about paris, and then brussels happens. i can’t keep track of all this shit. so you just give the fuck up. that’s the hallmark of your generation, and that’s fucked up, because your generation lives in the most difficult time in human history. this is the age of spin. the age where nobody knows what the fuck they’re even looking at. did you know that planned parenthood was for abortions? it’s for people that don’t plan things out at all. that’s right. so, a guy your age doesn’t really know how he feels. are you pro-choice? are you anti-consequences? what does it all really mean? it’s easier not to care for you. but for us, we were trained to care. we were raised that way. i used to watch a fucking cartoon when i was growing up called care bears. it was about a fucking group of teddy-bear people. they were like teddy bears, but they were like people, and they were all different colors, and they all fucking just walked around, caring. they cared about each other and everything else. they all had different designs on their stomachs, and the designs told you something about what they might be like inside. very, very loving group of beings. and when shit got real bad, as nice as those teddy bears were, they didn’t get mean faces. they got determined. hmm! and the leader would say, “come on, guys. it’s time for the care bear stare!” remember that shit? and them little teddy bears would lock arms… and stare at the problem– and i’m not even bullshitting– actual love would shoot out of their chests… and would dispel anything that was fucked up. and when we grew up, we wanted to be like those bears. and then we got our hearts broken, because we found out that life wasn’t gonna let us do that and that it’s impossible to shoot love out of your chest. however, i have shot love onto somebody’s chest before. i do it all the time. it’s the next best thing. you kids don’t know. your generation is just determined to be angry, mad. everybody’s mad. back when we were growing up, only black people were mad. now everybody’s just trying to get in on the act. i try to think to myself, “when did everyone get mad?” and then i realize this happened before we were born. this is a long way to go, but… it probably started in the second world war. think about it. all these black men, millions of black men, leave the united states for the first time, go over to europe with america’s armed forces and fight the nazis and make more money fighting nazis than they ever dreamed they would make in the united states. and a lot of those men, while they were in europe– just to be real, not to be crass– a lot of them probably got their dicks sucked by white women. i’m sorry, ladies and gentlemen. this was world war ii europe, and these were desperate times, and penises were being sucked for shoelaces and chocolate and very frivolous things. and it’s very hard to come back to america and sit on the back of the bus after you’ve been in the south of france, getting your dick sucked for a crunch bar or some crazy shit like that. that’s a life-changing experience. and while that was happening in europe, here in america, for the first time, women entered the workforce en masse, by the millions. all the men were gone. someone had to run the factory. the ladies did it. that’s right. this was the first generation of american women to have independent income en masse, and when the men came back, the women weren’t the same. american women had grown. they were uttering phrases that no woman on earth had ever spoken before, things like, “no” and “shut the fuck up” and “i don’t feel like it.” and then behind the scenes of that, there was a little-known government agency that started testing mind control drugs on the american public. they fucked up. they tested it for 12 years. they didn’t realize these drugs were not mind-controlling. they were mind-expanding. it was lsd and mescaline and shit like that. and for the first time, there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question the very society they lived in. by 1960, the president of the united states was only 42 years old. can you imagine? dmx is older than that. and he was gonna usher in a new era of peace. he was gonna avoid the cold war. he was gonna end segregation. and they blew his fucking brains out in front of everyone in dallas. this country was never the same. there were seven more major assassinations in the ’60s. anyone that stood up and said anything was shot down in the streets like a fucking dog. kennedy, kennedy, king, x, evers, on and on. you didn’t even have to be famous. you could be a college student at kent state, or in mississippi, protesting the vietnam war, and they shot them, too. the ’70s were a wild era. and while all this was going on… bill cosby raped 54 people. holy shit. that’s a lot of rapes, man. this guy’s putting up real numbers. he’s like the steph curry of rape. man, that’s a lot of rapes. fifty-four? if he had raped less people… that’s still two dozen rapes! don’t forget, each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it. ladies and gentlemen, that’s over hours of rape. it only takes hours to get a pilot’s license. if rapes were aircrafts, this n i g g a is top gun for sure. yeah, that’s a tough one. and i was onstage not too long ago. i was in syracuse, new york. yeah. well, yeah, for syracuse. but the show didn’t go so good… all because i was talking about bill cosby a little bit. not a little bit. i’ll be honest. i talked about him for like, minutes. and a woman stood up in the back of the room, and she screamed out, “you are a fucking asshole for saying these things!” “i know.” instantly, i felt bad. not bad about what i was saying. i just felt bad like, “oh, that’s too bad she doesn’t like the show.” i didn’t realize it at first, but not only did she say that, she was rushing the stage. by the time i saw her, i just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode. i was horrified. i said, “oh, my god! i’m gonna kick this bitch in the face.” lucky for me, i didn’t have to. security tackled her. but it was a really fucking horrifying scene. a scuffle ensued. and then, finally, she screamed out to me, “women suffer!” i said, “i know.” and, ladies, i need you to know… that i know. i need you to know. seriously, there’s a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists. i would include myself in that. don’t ever forget, we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives, and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender. there’s a lot of men like that in this room. there’s a lot of men like that in the world. or as we are known on the streets, bitch-ass n i g g a s. but as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me, i started to take offense. and i’ll be honest, race was involved. she was a young white woman. well-intentioned, but just not thinking it all the way through. “bitch, how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination?” she didn’t get it. she just kept going. “women suffer!” “i know.” “women suffer!” “same team.” “women suffer!” “i know.” and this is when she went too far: “we suffer just like you.” “slow your roll, bitch. you suffer, yes, but not like me. not like us.” she goes, “suffering is suffering. what’s the difference?” i said, “come on, white woman, you know what it is. you was in on the heist. you just don’t like your cut.” you suffer, i suffer. you suffer, i suffer. that’s how it works. can’t do comparative suffering. if you’re hungry, and your friend says, “you know, people are starving in africa,” “so what, n i g g a? i still want lunch.” black people know about comparative suffering, and you know that it’s a fucking dead-end game. blacks and jews do that shit to each other all the time. you ever played who suffered more with a jewish person? it’s a tough game. whenever you think you’ve got the jewish guy on the ropes, that motherfucker will be like, “well, don’t forget about egypt.” “egypt?! god damn, n i g g a, i didn’t know we was going all the way back to egypt.” what the fuck is wrong with her? what does she think? does she think that i don’t know that rape is wrong? does she think that maybe i don’t have empathy for bill cosby’s alleged victims? and i would be remiss if i didn’t remind you that technically these are all still allegations. although, i admit it looks very bad. perhaps if she looked at it correctly, she would have empathy for me, the man she was attacking, a 42-year-old black comedian. obviously, bill cosby was a hero to me. and she doesn’t know what it feels like to think that your hero might’ve done something so heinous, my god, you can’t imagine. it’d be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself… had raped 54 people. you’d say to yourself, “oh, man, but i like chocolate ice cream. i don’t want it to rape.” didn’t want to believe it. at first, i didn’t believe it. i said, “these people are obviously trying to destroy dr. cosby’s rich legacy.” even 34 allegations into it, i was still like, “man… he probably only raped ten or 11 of those people.” i know, i know. but it’s really tough. you guys are young. imagine if you found out 40 years from now that kevin hart raped 54 people. you’d be like, “oh, my god.” the only one that would believe that would be katt williams. he’d be like, “i knew that motherfucker was up to something! i knew kevin had raped those people.” you know, i was mad at kevin, too, though. you know why? okay, first of all, i didn’t even know kevin was as successful as he was. i found that shit out the hard way. i was at home when my son busted in. he said, “dad, i need $250.” he’s only years old, so i freaked out. “what’s going on, n i g g a? is somebody trying to kill you?” he said, “no, no. kevin hart’s coming to town, and i wanted to see his show.” i said, “how much are the tickets?” he said, “they’re $125.” i said, “god damn! mine are only 80.” i said, “why do you need $250, then?” he goes, “because i want to go with you, dad. please? and there it is. so, i took him to the show. and we go, we sit right up front. the lights go down, and one opening act after another goes on. then kevin takes the stage. the crowd goes fucking nuts. thousands of people. i was furious. the longer the show went on, the madder i got. because his show was fucking outstanding. it was maddening. these people were fucking holding their stomachs. my son was slapping his knee. i’m like, “damn, n i g g a, i do this, too.” kevin says, “good night.” the crowd goes crazy. and then everyone starts walking to his door, and the lights come on, and then my son is just standing there, looking at an empty stage. people are pushing past me, and nobody’s recognizing me. i’m like, “man, this place fucking sucks!” i said, “come on, son, let’s get out of here.” then my son looks back at me and says, “dad, please. please, i have to meet him.” i was like, “oh, my god.” so, i took him backstage. i’ve known kevin for years, but can you believe i was scared to knock on his dressing room door? i almost said… “son, i haven’t seen him for a long time.” and one of kevin’s goons opened the door. “hey, what’s up, dave chappelle? what are you doing, man? it’s good to see you, brother. what are you doing in this area? this is a terrible area.” i’m like, “actually, i live around here. listen… is kevin here? my son just wanted to meet him real quick.” “i don’t know, ’cause kevin’s about to eat dinner.” just then, kevin came around the corner to see who it was. “what? oh, shit! what’s up, dave? come on back. i was just about to have dinner. i don’t know if you guys ate, but you’re welcome to join me if you’d like.” and then my son pushed passed me. it was some cold shit. he goes, “actually, mr. hart, we haven’t eaten in several hours.” man, kevin took us into his back room. this guy had a fucking spread. it was tuesday night. this motherfucker was having sunday dinner. there were steaks, chops, corn with butter all over it. my son was eating all fast, embarrassing me. i was like, “slow down, son.” he was like… then i looked over in the corner, and there was a box of custom-made jerseys for the local team. each one was hand-stitched, and on the back, they stitched on “k-hart” on all of them. kevin saw me staring at that box, and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys, and he walked right to my son. he said, “hey, little man. i want you to have this.” and my son was like, “thanks, mr. hart.” this is when i got mad. he goes, “if your father ever makes you mad, put that on.” and he walked out. oh, that was some cold shit. then i realized– i looked up what kevin made on google. i couldn’t believe that shit. kevin is the first comedian that a drake song could be about. kevin could walk around his house and sing “all me,” and the whole song would still be true. “♪ got everything, i got everything ♪\n",

            "♪ ahah ahah ahah ♪ thank you thank you very much thank you all oh wow that was exciting wasn’t it thank you guys have a seat feel comfortable relax i want to thank everyone in la for a wonderful week it’s been great here you know what it’s been ten years since the last time i played los angeles if you can imagine i know i know i’ve been gone for a very long time and unbeknownst to you it was a difficult ten years i’m not gonna take you through all the agony i’ve been through but it was tough some of it you might’ve seen i don’t know if you ever saw on tmz the big headline “dave chappelle drunk onstage in detroit” well if you saw it i wasn’t drunk i had smoked some reefer… with some rappers yeah i don’t know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers but their weed is very strong stronger than i what i was accustomed to the article goes on to say i was booed offstage which is also incorrect i was booed i did not leave it was a long bomb it was a fucking nightmare two puffs of weed that’s all it was two puffs i never had that happen where i take two puffs of weed i looked at the guy next to me i was like “i’m gonna bomb n i g g a i can feel it” and that guy called my name “dave chappelle” n i g g a s was like… normally when you do a comedy show– you guys don’t know what it looks like up here but n i g g a s be just looking up at you like… that’s how the show started didn’t take long for their faces to switch up like “what the fuck” they started looking amongst themselves so i knew i wasn’t doing good i don’t remember what i was saying it just took one person to break the ice it was a black lady with a ford motor shirt on stood up suddenly “fuck you dave chappelle” i said “excuse me” she said “i worked all week for this shit and this show sucks” and in a weird act of racial harmony a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up “yeah” the whole crowd banded together and started chanting “we want our money back we want our money back” i said “oh shit” i snapped out of it “good people of detroit hear me hear me now you will never get your fucking money back” fuck that i said “i’m like evel knievel i get paid for the attempt i didn’t promise this shit would be good” “boo” they said “fuck you” this went on for a long time and then after the show i felt so bad i took half of the money from the show– thousands of dollars– i said “i’m gonna give this to charity” you know what i did i bought 25000 worth of bubble gum and drove around detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry i was very mad at detroit that night because not only did i bomb i had to go back to the very same room the next night and do it all over again fucking nightmare that would be like if you were having sex with a woman and for some reason– this would never happen– but for some reason she had a mousetrap in her pussy you get caught in the trap and then you’ve got to fuck her again tomorrow night i’d still do it but i’d be careful the next time the old mousetrapinthepussy trick eh fool me once yeah yeah it was a tough time and i wanted to give up sometimes i almost did give up but then right before i gave up i decided not to but i made the call they answered the phone “hello dancing with the stars” i said “not yet not yet” yeah if you see me on that shit it’s over trust me my spirit is broken if you see me waiting for them judges… getting critiqued on my chacha fuck that i’ve been hanging out in– i haven’t been working in la but i come out here and hang out and shit i was out here a few weeks ago i almost got arrested i’m not bullshitting this happens to a lot of black people what happened was… i was coming out of one of those nightclubs in hollywood and my friend saw me i guess i was wobbling or something so he just rolled up he’s a good friend of mine he’s like “hey dave give me the keys” i was like “all right n i g g a just take the keys” and i got in the passenger’s side of my car and he drove it it was fine just talking chopping it up and then on the 10 the blueandwhites hit us now i should tell you the friend that was driving me was black which really doesn’t have anything to do with the story other than to let you know there was fear in the car not my fear i’m black but i’m also dave chappelle so i figured you know shit will probably be fine traffic stop started off on the right foot the cops came up to the driver’s side “hi how are you guys doing tonight” and he recognized me immediately “oh dave chappelle” and i looked at my friend like “we’re getting out of this shit” and then he says “you guys were swerving in the lane do you mind just stepping out of the car for a second” still no cause for alarm i looked through the rearview mirror the body language of the arrest looked good just talking so then i started fucking with the radio you know a traffic stop is going good if you’re listening to the radio when someone else is outside of the car but then when i looked back in the rearview mirror something had gone horribly wrong that motherfucker was back there like… and the next thing i knew they were stuffing him in the back of the car and i thought what anybody would think in a situation like that “oh my god what is gonna happen to me” and the police walked up to the window “mr chappelle we had to arrest your friend he refused to take our breathalyzer test” i said “that motherfucker not complying that’s odd so officer what’s gonna happen to me” “you’re fine we’re just gonna have to ask you to step out of the car so we can impound the vehicle and we’ll arrange for you to have a ride home” i said “oh well no i would rather you just give me the keys” he said “mr chappelle your friend already told us he’s your designated driver we can’t let you drive in this condition” i was like “no n i g g a i’m good” and then suddenly the shit turned into vegas he was like… “i’ll let you blow for it” i said “excuse me” he said “if you blow in my breathalyzer–” i said “oh n i g g a i thought you was trying to get your dick sucked what’s the– whew whew” “if you blow in my breathalyzer and pass i’ll give you the keys to the car” i said “uh… set ’em up n i g g a let’s play” and i blew in that thing and it made a noise “beep” i said “uhoh” and he looked at it he said “oh well mr chappelle i guess you’re free to go” i said “i am” i didn’t know that thing didn’t pick up weed i drove home on the miles an hour yeah it all worked out it all worked out i’m one of the lucky ones it doesn’t work out that well for everybody i saw that videotape of that lady that got beat up in la in traffic you see that shit on rush hour traffic they beat a black woman’s ass this woman didn’t even do anything wrong it’s fucked up it was so fucked up it didn’t even go to court the city of la just gave that woman 15 million for her pain and suffering that is not bad considering that’s the same amount of money that marcos maidana made to fight floyd mayweather the second time and this woman obviously hasn’t trained a day in her life you can see it on the tape she didn’t come to fight her guards were low she was taking a lot of shots everybody’s mad at police now i watched that– you see that shit on netflix making a murderer the steven avery story if you haven’t seen it check it out steven avery is in more trouble than any white person in the history of the united states has ever been in in a justice system designed for him to thrive he’s failed miserably twice i can’t even wrap my mind around it if making a murderer was about a black dude that shit would be called duh of course everything would go wrong seems like he did it all right the motherfucker even had 200000 for his legal defense that should get you off in wisconsin that’s like oj money all he needed to get off that he didn’t have was a single black juror that’s all it would’ve took because only a black dude in the united states can look at other dudes and be like “i think the police did this shit” he’s fucked up in the game that’s how oj got off i’ve been watching that new oj show i can’t get enough of that shit doesn’t it bring back good memories but i forgot just how polarizing that oj case was and you know i’ve met oj simpson on four different occasions in my life and before the end of the show i will tell you about each of those occasions the first time i met oj simpson i was in santa monica santa monica yeah i can’t believe a black dude was like “santa monica” you the last n i g g a i would expect to say that let me see your shoes you got some vans on n i g g a what you got “santa monica” you at the time i was  i had done a show and the guy from the club came up and was like “hey oj simpson’s here and he said he wants to meet you” i said “what fuck yeah” i ran down the steps and oj was down there he’s like “hey young man how are you it’s very good to meet you and you’re doing really good work and i hope good things happen for you in your life” i was like “man thanks mr juice” standing beside him was– i don’t know the nice way to say this– his soontobeslain wife ladies and gentlemen man the fuck up or you’re not gonna make it to the end of this show just man the fuck up she’s dead we already know what happened we don’t know who did it but we know what happened i should tell you that woman was very nice to me she actually embraced me she said “i think you’re adorable” and she hugged me she goes “good luck to you” and she held me for a long time and i whispered in her ear “bitch are you trying to get us both killed” i’m just kidding i didn’t say that but… that was the first time in a nutshell it’s good to see so many… so many different people here from so many different ethnicities very diverse crowd looks like you thought bernie sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker but… surprise it’s me yeah yeah you know i’m happy really to see black people come a lot of black people don’t fuck with me like they used to but there’s a few reasons you don’t see black people at my shows one is because obviously black people have slower internet connections i mean that would be my guess i don’t know what– actually my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community i hold so dear a couple of weeks ago i was supposed to be in flint michigan for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in flint i don’t know if you know this but the water in flint is fucking poisonous it’s actually making people sick hollywood people are like “so what at least they have water” but this water– this water is fucked up so a lot of black celebrities flew into flint and they did a tremendous charity benefit and i was on the schedule to appear uh… so the reason a lot of people haven’t heard about this benefit– it was the same day as the oscars right i know so i was on my way to the airport to go to flint and then chris rock calls me and is like “hey dave i got a ticket for you for the oscars can you make it” and i was like “sure n i g g a i’m on my way to the airport right now” come on man what am i gonna do about that water what am i a fucking superhero i need to have fun i need to live too i didn’t fuck that water up stevie wonder was there they didn’t need me i’m sorry everybody i’d never been to the oscars you’ve seen the movies i make i was excited i knew i was gonna get into some trouble because when i was walking on the red carpet the black press came after me “excuse me brother” when you hear somebody call you “brother” too much something terrible is about to happen “excuse me brother brother” and i looked back and the motherfucker had a tuxedo with the kente cloth tie i said “uhoh” he said “i just want to ask you a couple questions” i said “what publication are you with” he said “me i’m with the daily bongo” i said “daily bongo what the fuck who the fuck reads this” he said “listen brother i just want to ask you a quick question you understand that this year this is a boycott for the oscars so i’m just wondering what made you of all people cross the motherfucking picket line and be here tonight” i said “boycott n i g g a i haven’t been working in ten years what do you mean boycott i’ve been on strike y’all n i g g a s didn’t stop working i had to watch fucking key and peele do my show every night so fuck the daily bongo” is what i said i went to the oscars and had a wonderful time i went in that fucking green room it was filled with so many stars i couldn’t even believe what i was seeing hollywood was seducing me all over again i was sitting back there i’m smoking drinking with the stars and then two hollywood movie producers came over right to me “oh my god dave chappelle” said the leader one he was obviously gay some guys you can just tell the other one seemed like a money guy maybe he was from texas or some shit but the gay one was definitely the leader because he did all the talking and then he hit me with “so david um… do you have any movie ideas that you would like to pursue” the truth is i don’t but if you know the game you’re not supposed to tell motherfuckers you don’t have ideas i was like “yeah man i got plenty of ideas” and he called my bluff “really like what” “huh oh um… um…” and then i just started making up shit that i thought maybe he’d like to see i said “i have a superhero idea” he goes “really” i go “yeah he’s a– he’s a gay superhero” he was like “really what’s it called” “huh oh it’s called– it’s called same hero new boots it’s about a gay souschef in san francisco… that gets bit by a radioactive rat on his shift when he’s taking out the trash and is blessed with powers beyond his wildest dreams supersonic gay kind of powers and he starts saving everybody in san francisco but at first he only saves gay people later he saves everybody and the whole city just falls in love with him the only problem is no one remembers him when he saves them” “well i don’t understand why wouldn’t they remember him” i said “because dummy he’s gay he keeps changing his outfit people come up– ‘thanks for saving me sir what’s your name anyway’ he’s like ‘same hero new boots’ and that motherfucker flies away” he was like “i like it a lot” the texan didn’t like that shit at all he was upset “that’s impossible a gay superhero” i said “what well i have others i have a superhero you’d love ’cause he’s stronger than superman and he fights for truth justice and the american way like superman but more than superman he beats up mexicans for no reason” the texan’s like “you got my attention” i’m like “man this motherfucker’s so strong he can fly and do all this great shit only problem with this guy is he can’t even activate his powers unless he touches– unless he touches a woman’s vagina not a long touch just a couple of pats” he said “well what’s the problem with that” i said “the problem sir is that our hero is not a handsome man and he’s often short on cash so whenever trouble breaks out he has to run around the city and convince women to let him pat their vaginas ‘please miss that building’s on fire can i pat your vagina quickly people are dying’ but he can’t tell them exactly why ‘eww get away you’re gross’ ‘please miss people are dying just a couple of pats’ ‘eww gross get away’ so he rapes them i know i know that’s the dilemma for the audience because he rapes but he saves a lot of lives and he saves way more than he rapes and he only rapes to save but he does rape” i didn’t realize it but the whole green room was looking at us all the celebrities were disgusted “ohh” that guy from texas was like “here’s my card call me on monday” that worked out the second time i met oj simpson it was right after the trial of the century there i was now a young man of probably 23 oj simpson was the most famous or infamous face on planet earth i was in a restaurant in beverly hills with my agents i wasn’t alone in the restaurant but i was alone i was the only black person in the restaurant and in the 90’s that felt very uncomfortable now i tend to enjoy it at this age i was having dinner with my agents celebrating a deal that they told me was lucrative but i later learned fucking sucked and suddenly a group of women walked by every race was in that group black white asian latina white white… and white again they were all gorgeous i watched them walk by then i saw a familiar face al cowlings the man from the infamous bronco chase walked by and embraced one of the women and they walked towards the door couldn’t believe what i saw and then close behind him was oj simpson newly released from jail the restaurant fell still i was shocked i didn’t mean to say it out loud but it just came out “oj” he stopped turned around to see who said it saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me i was sitting in the corner of the booth he leaned over all the white people i was having dinner with and shook my hand “how are you young man” he looked in my eyes and i could see in his eyes that he didn’t remember meeting me the first time and then he walked away and i looked back at my agents and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces and the only one with the courage to voice their disgust was a woman named sharon who used to represent me “how could you” she said “how could you shake hands with that murderer” i said “sharon with all due respect that murderer ran for over 11000 yards and he was acquitted so you know fuck it the glove didn’t fit the glove didn’t fit get over yourself” some people can’t do that some people just can’t get over themselves gay people have a hard time doing that recently here we go here comes the deep water no recently i’ve noticed that i noticed it with that manny pacquiao controversy yeah it was– now in the gay community’s defense manny pacquiao said some outlandish shit about gay people very not nice things that i won’t repeat but there was biblical verses and some analogies to animals it wasn’t a good look nike took his shoes immediately which i thought was a little harsh a little harsh you know what i mean just ’cause he’s asian you know what i mean how the fuck are you gonna take the shoes off an asian dude to appease a gay dude you know what i mean no you don’t know what i mean but asian people kind of know what i mean no no asians in the front no no this is what i mean look you’re an asian dude– i say this with no disrespect we’re all americans right and we can agree that america has a huge body count all over the world but nowhere more than asia literally if you look at history recently we have bombed the masculinity out of an entire continent we dropped two atomic bombs on fucking japan and they’ve been drawing hello kitty and shit ever since there’s a lot of ladyboys in the wake of our bombs and i know these things because my wife is asian she’s filipino all right okay so that explains it now you know why you see me at all those filipino events i’m not there picking up pussy i’m dropping some off i take my wife to all that shit i took my wife to see pacquiao fight mayweather we sat ringside okay that– yeah that was a quiet car ride home that’s what that was but if you know what’s popping in the philippines you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the philippines growing up without their mothers yes a lot of women in the philippines go to the arabian peninsula they come to the united states they make all their money here they send all that money back home which is still one of the numberone staples in the philippines’ economy– money that the expats send back to the philippines the men on the other hand are left rearing children twiddling their thumbs waiting on their wives’ checks these men have been fucking emasculated and then suddenly a boxer rises from amongst them and reinstates their manhood with his motherfucking fist this is not the guy you’re supposed to ask “what do you think of homosexuals” he’s not your champ shit that’s why i don’t have a sneaker deal ’cause if you say something that people don’t like they’ll take your fucking shoes off if martin luther king had a sneaker deal we’d still be on the back of the bus it’s true the nike exec would come up– “hi martin uh… we need you to tone down the talk of civil rights and blacks being humans it’s upsetting our southern distributors” “but i don’t understand i thought that’s why i had a sneaker deal in the first place” “not quite really it’s a walking shoe and we like the marching but… try to understand” fuck that shit you know i get it though i understand why gay people are mad and i empathize you know what i’m just telling you this as a black dude i support your movement but if you want to take some advice from a negro pace yourself these things take a while just ’cause they passed the law doesn’t mean they’re gonna like it brown v board of education was in somebody called me a n i g g e r in traffic last wednesday it takes a minute my wife’s friend stewart told me that my wife has a lot of gay friends stewart’s their leader she has a lot of gay friends and i don’t like ’em not ’cause they’re gay i’m just judging them on the merits of their character they’re just not nice dudes they’re fucking rude houseguests they’re sitting on my couch giggling with my wife eating my motherfucking macaroons then i come in and they act like the party’s over “hey stewart what’s going on” this guy talks to me the way a cat would speak if a cat could talk “hi david” “stewart what’s all the beef man what’s going–” he always wants to have some kind of gay political argument the last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words “husband and wife” out of the law i said “why would you want those words out of the law” he said “because it discriminates against samesex couples” i was like “n i g g a s please save me the semantics just trust me take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino you’re about to crap out just go outside talk that over amongst yourselves and whichever one of you is gayer that’s the wife” no no stewart didn’t like that stewart educates me about this movement i didn’t even know shit about it he told me it’s called “lbgtq” i was like “what the fuck is the ‘q’” does that even make sense “q” turns out “q” is like the vowels that shit is sometimes “y” it’s for gay dudes that don’t really know they’re gay like prison fags who are like “what i’m not gay n i g g a i’m just sucking these dicks to pass the time i’m not ‘g’ i’m ‘q’ ugh” i think– okay again of all those letters the “t” has the toughest road ahead in fact i think the “t” should stand for “tough road ahead” they’ve got the longest mental gap to bridge that’s all i’m saying because whenever i see one of them ts on the street i don’t mind them but i’ll be like “man i miss bruce” i’m sorry guys i’m 42 i remember bruce jenner before the kardashians before all that this motherfucker was a white american superhero it was amazing he was beating africans at track and field we’d never seen anything like it he was on my cereal box growing up you know how much of that cereal i ate n i g g a i didn’t know he was gonna do that i knew before you guys knew i heard things on the street in hollywood you’d just be out see people “hey what’s up kanye why the long face” “n i g g a you’ll see i got two motherinlaws now” and when i heard he was gonna do it i was scared i didn’t think the public was ready i didn’t think the media was ready and you know what i was wrong not only did the public embrace him but the media was nice i’d never seen anything like it “welcome to the world caitlyn so long bruce hello caitlyn” i was shocked is this happening wait a minute is this a time in american history where an american can make a decision for themselves and even though other americans don’t understand it they’ll support it and let this person live a happy life is this what’s happening if it is then good for america that’s dave chappelle the american although dave chappelle the black american he was a little jealous i was like “how the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination olympics” if the police shot half as many transgenders as they did n i g g a s last year there’d be a fucking war in la i know black dudes in brooklyn– hard street motherfuckers– that wear high heels just to feel safe transgenders are gangsters i used to do business with a transgender in hollywood man everybody would be scared of her in the boardroom she’d walk in there newlyminted woman high heels purse wouldn’t say anything to us just walk around the conference table looking mean and shit then she’d walk to the head of the conference table stare at us all reach in her purse pull her old dick out and throw it on the table “let’s talk business gentlemen” “aaah” shit is scary as fuck if your best friend pitched that to you you’d be horrified “yo n i g g a let’s go to the hospital and cut our dicks off and make pussies out of them shits” “what can’t we just get matching jackets or tattoos or something you sure that’s what you want to do” “there’s only way to find out n i g g a wutang pow pow let’s go to the club and trick n i g g a s into fucking us yeah” the third time i met oj simpson— the third time i met oj simpson i was doing great in life i’d just finished the second season of chappelle’s show man those were good days i was playing a comedy club in miami the improv i don’t know if you’ve ever been but if you have you’d know the door for the green room is right on the stage can you imagine such a thing if i walked out of the door of the green room bam i was right here right from the dressing room and i did that i walked out and the whole crowd was like “hooray” and i looked– ma’am as close as you are to me– i saw him as soon as i came out the juice and i saw recognition in his eyes and it filled me with pride that he knew who i was i didn’t acknowledge his presence because it was a white audience and i didn’t want to start a panic but i did my show the show went great i said “good night everyone” they all said “yay” and i didn’t say nothing to oj but i just gave him the signal to let him know i knew he was there and i walked into the green room and oj was already in there i was like “how the fuck is this possible” i was scared and then my friends came in and we all started talking we sat down on the couch and i’m just telling you what i saw with my own eyes you can believe me or not believe me but in my experience oj simpson– one of the nicest men i’d ever met he was nice to me he was nice to my friends the conversation was filled with warmth and levity humor and wisdom we talked for minutes and then suddenly the juice said “you know what i’ve got to be going but it’s good to see you again and i’m glad things went so well” i said “thanks juice” and my friends said “yeah goodbye mr juice” they were new to the game he said “no thank you… for your hospitality good night guys“ and we said “good night” and he just walked out of the room and as soon as the door closed we all looked at each other like “that n i g g a did that shit did you feel that i could feel like… murder in the room” well you young heads missed that shit you’re all too young you don’t remember that how old are you young man you twentyfour twentyfour you don’t know shit you don’t know shit you gotta google shit that i lived through see this is why i lock motherfuckers’ phones up seriously because the young kids you guys need to take a break from that– we all need to break just from that technology just for a minute you know i’m from a different time young man a dark time to you i’m from a time that i didn’t even used to know who was on the phone until i answered the shit like when tragedy used to strike i remember i was 12 years old and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom you remember these days and she turned it on to one of three channels and she said “class the space shuttle is taking off and we’re all gonna watch it take off” man that shit was going great for like three to five minutes that’s right you remember it fucking exploded right on television everybody on board dead immediately presumed dead it was so bad the teacher looked at all the kids and was like… “you can go home” it was a goddamn national tragedy this was cold war america the russians were laughing at us my point is for a guy your age wouldn’t even know the pain because in your generation it’s like the space shuttle blows up every fucking day how can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing i’m getting over one cop shooting and then another one happens and then another one happens and another one happens i’m crying about paris and then brussels happens i can’t keep track of all this shit so you just give the fuck up that’s the hallmark of your generation and that’s fucked up because your generation lives in the most difficult time in human history this is the age of spin the age where nobody knows what the fuck they’re even looking at did you know that planned parenthood was for abortions it’s for people that don’t plan things out at all that’s right so a guy your age doesn’t really know how he feels are you prochoice are you anticonsequences what does it all really mean it’s easier not to care for you but for us we were trained to care we were raised that way i used to watch a fucking cartoon when i was growing up called care bears it was about a fucking group of teddybear people they were like teddy bears but they were like people and they were all different colors and they all fucking just walked around caring they cared about each other and everything else they all had different designs on their stomachs and the designs told you something about what they might be like inside very very loving group of beings and when shit got real bad as nice as those teddy bears were they didn’t get mean faces they got determined hmm and the leader would say “come on guys it’s time for the care bear stare” remember that shit and them little teddy bears would lock arms… and stare at the problem– and i’m not even bullshitting– actual love would shoot out of their chests… and would dispel anything that was fucked up and when we grew up we wanted to be like those bears and then we got our hearts broken because we found out that life wasn’t gonna let us do that and that it’s impossible to shoot love out of your chest however i have shot love onto somebody’s chest before i do it all the time it’s the next best thing you kids don’t know your generation is just determined to be angry mad everybody’s mad back when we were growing up only black people were mad now everybody’s just trying to get in on the act i try to think to myself “when did everyone get mad” and then i realize this happened before we were born this is a long way to go but… it probably started in the second world war think about it all these black men millions of black men leave the united states for the first time go over to europe with america’s armed forces and fight the nazis and make more money fighting nazis than they ever dreamed they would make in the united states and a lot of those men while they were in europe– just to be real not to be crass– a lot of them probably got their dicks sucked by white women i’m sorry ladies and gentlemen this was world war ii europe and these were desperate times and penises were being sucked for shoelaces and chocolate and very frivolous things and it’s very hard to come back to america and sit on the back of the bus after you’ve been in the south of france getting your dick sucked for a crunch bar or some crazy shit like that that’s a lifechanging experience and while that was happening in europe here in america for the first time women entered the workforce en masse by the millions all the men were gone someone had to run the factory the ladies did it that’s right this was the first generation of american women to have independent income en masse and when the men came back the women weren’t the same american women had grown they were uttering phrases that no woman on earth had ever spoken before things like “no” and “shut the fuck up” and “i don’t feel like it” and then behind the scenes of that there was a littleknown government agency that started testing mind control drugs on the american public they fucked up they tested it for 12 years they didn’t realize these drugs were not mindcontrolling they were mindexpanding it was lsd and mescaline and shit like that and for the first time there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question the very society they lived in by 1960 the president of the united states was only 42 years old can you imagine dmx is older than that and he was gonna usher in a new era of peace he was gonna avoid the cold war he was gonna end segregation and they blew his fucking brains out in front of everyone in dallas this country was never the same there were seven more major assassinations in the ’60s anyone that stood up and said anything was shot down in the streets like a fucking dog kennedy kennedy king x evers on and on you didn’t even have to be famous you could be a college student at kent state or in mississippi protesting the vietnam war and they shot them too the ’70s were a wild era and while all this was going on… bill cosby raped 54 people holy shit that’s a lot of rapes man this guy’s putting up real numbers he’s like the steph curry of rape man that’s a lot of rapes fiftyfour if he had raped less people… that’s still two dozen rapes don’t forget each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it ladies and gentlemen that’s over hours of rape it only takes hours to get a pilot’s license if rapes were aircrafts this n i g g a is top gun for sure yeah that’s a tough one and i was onstage not too long ago i was in syracuse new york yeah well yeah for syracuse but the show didn’t go so good… all because i was talking about bill cosby a little bit not a little bit i’ll be honest i talked about him for like minutes and a woman stood up in the back of the room and she screamed out “you are a fucking asshole for saying these things” “i know” instantly i felt bad not bad about what i was saying i just felt bad like “oh that’s too bad she doesn’t like the show” i didn’t realize it at first but not only did she say that she was rushing the stage by the time i saw her i just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode i was horrified i said “oh my god i’m gonna kick this bitch in the face” lucky for me i didn’t have to security tackled her but it was a really fucking horrifying scene a scuffle ensued and then finally she screamed out to me “women suffer” i said “i know” and ladies i need you to know… that i know i need you to know seriously there’s a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists i would include myself in that don’t ever forget we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender there’s a lot of men like that in this room there’s a lot of men like that in the world or as we are known on the streets bitchass n i g g a s but as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me i started to take offense and i’ll be honest race was involved she was a young white woman wellintentioned but just not thinking it all the way through “bitch how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination” she didn’t get it she just kept going “women suffer” “i know” “women suffer” “same team” “women suffer” “i know” and this is when she went too far “we suffer just like you” “slow your roll bitch you suffer yes but not like me not like us” she goes “suffering is suffering what’s the difference” i said “come on white woman you know what it is you was in on the heist you just don’t like your cut” you suffer i suffer you suffer i suffer that’s how it works can’t do comparative suffering if you’re hungry and your friend says “you know people are starving in africa” “so what n i g g a i still want lunch” black people know about comparative suffering and you know that it’s a fucking deadend game blacks and jews do that shit to each other all the time you ever played who suffered more with a jewish person it’s a tough game whenever you think you’ve got the jewish guy on the ropes that motherfucker will be like “well don’t forget about egypt” “egypt god damn n i g g a i didn’t know we was going all the way back to egypt” what the fuck is wrong with her what does she think does she think that i don’t know that rape is wrong does she think that maybe i don’t have empathy for bill cosby’s alleged victims and i would be remiss if i didn’t remind you that technically these are all still allegations although i admit it looks very bad perhaps if she looked at it correctly she would have empathy for me the man she was attacking a 42yearold black comedian obviously bill cosby was a hero to me and she doesn’t know what it feels like to think that your hero might’ve done something so heinous my god you can’t imagine it’d be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself… had raped 54 people you’d say to yourself “oh man but i like chocolate ice cream i don’t want it to rape” didn’t want to believe it at first i didn’t believe it i said “these people are obviously trying to destroy dr cosby’s rich legacy” even 34 allegations into it i was still like “man… he probably only raped ten or 11 of those people” i know i know but it’s really tough you guys are young imagine if you found out 40 years from now that kevin hart raped 54 people you’d be like “oh my god” the only one that would believe that would be katt williams he’d be like “i knew that motherfucker was up to something i knew kevin had raped those people” you know i was mad at kevin too though you know why okay first of all i didn’t even know kevin was as successful as he was i found that shit out the hard way i was at home when my son busted in he said “dad i need 250” he’s only years old so i freaked out “what’s going on n i g g a is somebody trying to kill you” he said “no no kevin hart’s coming to town and i wanted to see his show” i said “how much are the tickets” he said “they’re 125” i said “god damn mine are only 80” i said “why do you need 250 then” he goes “because i want to go with you dad please and there it is so i took him to the show and we go we sit right up front the lights go down and one opening act after another goes on then kevin takes the stage the crowd goes fucking nuts thousands of people i was furious the longer the show went on the madder i got because his show was fucking outstanding it was maddening these people were fucking holding their stomachs my son was slapping his knee i’m like “damn n i g g a i do this too” kevin says “good night” the crowd goes crazy and then everyone starts walking to his door and the lights come on and then my son is just standing there looking at an empty stage people are pushing past me and nobody’s recognizing me i’m like “man this place fucking sucks” i said “come on son let’s get out of here” then my son looks back at me and says “dad please please i have to meet him” i was like “oh my god” so i took him backstage i’ve known kevin for years but can you believe i was scared to knock on his dressing room door i almost said… “son i haven’t seen him for a long time” and one of kevin’s goons opened the door “hey what’s up dave chappelle what are you doing man it’s good to see you brother what are you doing in this area this is a terrible area” i’m like “actually i live around here listen… is kevin here my son just wanted to meet him real quick” “i don’t know ’cause kevin’s about to eat dinner” just then kevin came around the corner to see who it was “what oh shit what’s up dave come on back i was just about to have dinner i don’t know if you guys ate but you’re welcome to join me if you’d like” and then my son pushed passed me it was some cold shit he goes “actually mr hart we haven’t eaten in several hours” man kevin took us into his back room this guy had a fucking spread it was tuesday night this motherfucker was having sunday dinner there were steaks chops corn with butter all over it my son was eating all fast embarrassing me i was like “slow down son” he was like… then i looked over in the corner and there was a box of custommade jerseys for the local team each one was handstitched and on the back they stitched on “khart” on all of them kevin saw me staring at that box and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys and he walked right to my son he said “hey little man i want you to have this” and my son was like “thanks mr hart” this is when i got mad he goes “if your father ever makes you mad put that on” and he walked out oh that was some cold shit then i realized– i looked up what kevin made on google i couldn’t believe that shit kevin is the first comedian that a drake song could be about kevin could walk around his house and sing “all me” and the whole song would still be true “♪ got everything i got everything ♪\n",

            "♪ ahah ahah ahah ♪ thank you thank you very much thank you all oh wow that was exciting wasn’t it thank you guys have a seat feel comfortable relax i want to thank everyone in la for a wonderful week it’s been great here you know what it’s been ten years since the last time i played los angeles if you can imagine i know i know i’ve been gone for a very long time and unbeknownst to you it was a difficult ten years i’m not gonna take you through all the agony i’ve been through but it was tough some of it you might’ve seen i don’t know if you ever saw on tmz the big headline “dave chappelle drunk onstage in detroit” well if you saw it i wasn’t drunk i had smoked some reefer… with some rappers yeah i don’t know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers but their weed is very strong stronger than i what i was accustomed to the article goes on to say i was booed offstage which is also incorrect i was booed i did not leave it was a long bomb it was a fucking nightmare two puffs of weed that’s all it was two puffs i never had that happen where i take two puffs of weed i looked at the guy next to me i was like “i’m gonna bomb n i g g a i can feel it” and that guy called my name “dave chappelle” n i g g a s was like… normally when you do a comedy show– you guys don’t know what it looks like up here but n i g g a s be just looking up at you like… that’s how the show started didn’t take long for their faces to switch up like “what the fuck” they started looking amongst themselves so i knew i wasn’t doing good i don’t remember what i was saying it just took one person to break the ice it was a black lady with a ford motor shirt on stood up suddenly “fuck you dave chappelle” i said “excuse me” she said “i worked all week for this shit and this show sucks” and in a weird act of racial harmony a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up “yeah” the whole crowd banded together and started chanting “we want our money back we want our money back” i said “oh shit” i snapped out of it “good people of detroit hear me hear me now you will never get your fucking money back” fuck that i said “i’m like evel knievel i get paid for the attempt i didn’t promise this shit would be good” “boo” they said “fuck you” this went on for a long time and then after the show i felt so bad i took half of the money from the show– thousands of dollars– i said “i’m gonna give this to charity” you know what i did i bought  worth of bubble gum and drove around detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry i was very mad at detroit that night because not only did i bomb i had to go back to the very same room the next night and do it all over again fucking nightmare that would be like if you were having sex with a woman and for some reason– this would never happen– but for some reason she had a mousetrap in her pussy you get caught in the trap and then you’ve got to fuck her again tomorrow night i’d still do it but i’d be careful the next time the old mousetrapinthepussy trick eh fool me once yeah yeah it was a tough time and i wanted to give up sometimes i almost did give up but then right before i gave up i decided not to but i made the call they answered the phone “hello dancing with the stars” i said “not yet not yet” yeah if you see me on that shit it’s over trust me my spirit is broken if you see me waiting for them judges… getting critiqued on my chacha fuck that i’ve been hanging out in– i haven’t been working in la but i come out here and hang out and shit i was out here a few weeks ago i almost got arrested i’m not bullshitting this happens to a lot of black people what happened was… i was coming out of one of those nightclubs in hollywood and my friend saw me i guess i was wobbling or something so he just rolled up he’s a good friend of mine he’s like “hey dave give me the keys” i was like “all right n i g g a just take the keys” and i got in the passenger’s side of my car and he drove it it was fine just talking chopping it up and then on the  the blueandwhites hit us now i should tell you the friend that was driving me was black which really doesn’t have anything to do with the story other than to let you know there was fear in the car not my fear i’m black but i’m also dave chappelle so i figured you know shit will probably be fine traffic stop started off on the right foot the cops came up to the driver’s side “hi how are you guys doing tonight” and he recognized me immediately “oh dave chappelle” and i looked at my friend like “we’re getting out of this shit” and then he says “you guys were swerving in the lane do you mind just stepping out of the car for a second” still no cause for alarm i looked through the rearview mirror the body language of the arrest looked good just talking so then i started fucking with the radio you know a traffic stop is going good if you’re listening to the radio when someone else is outside of the car but then when i looked back in the rearview mirror something had gone horribly wrong that motherfucker was back there like… and the next thing i knew they were stuffing him in the back of the car and i thought what anybody would think in a situation like that “oh my god what is gonna happen to me” and the police walked up to the window “mr chappelle we had to arrest your friend he refused to take our breathalyzer test” i said “that motherfucker not complying that’s odd so officer what’s gonna happen to me” “you’re fine we’re just gonna have to ask you to step out of the car so we can impound the vehicle and we’ll arrange for you to have a ride home” i said “oh well no i would rather you just give me the keys” he said “mr chappelle your friend already told us he’s your designated driver we can’t let you drive in this condition” i was like “no n i g g a i’m good” and then suddenly the shit turned into vegas he was like… “i’ll let you blow for it” i said “excuse me” he said “if you blow in my breathalyzer–” i said “oh n i g g a i thought you was trying to get your dick sucked what’s the– whew whew” “if you blow in my breathalyzer and pass i’ll give you the keys to the car” i said “uh… set ’em up n i g g a let’s play” and i blew in that thing and it made a noise “beep” i said “uhoh” and he looked at it he said “oh well mr chappelle i guess you’re free to go” i said “i am” i didn’t know that thing didn’t pick up weed i drove home on the miles an hour yeah it all worked out it all worked out i’m one of the lucky ones it doesn’t work out that well for everybody i saw that videotape of that lady that got beat up in la in traffic you see that shit on rush hour traffic they beat a black woman’s ass this woman didn’t even do anything wrong it’s fucked up it was so fucked up it didn’t even go to court the city of la just gave that woman  million for her pain and suffering that is not bad considering that’s the same amount of money that marcos maidana made to fight floyd mayweather the second time and this woman obviously hasn’t trained a day in her life you can see it on the tape she didn’t come to fight her guards were low she was taking a lot of shots everybody’s mad at police now i watched that– you see that shit on netflix making a murderer the steven avery story if you haven’t seen it check it out steven avery is in more trouble than any white person in the history of the united states has ever been in in a justice system designed for him to thrive he’s failed miserably twice i can’t even wrap my mind around it if making a murderer was about a black dude that shit would be called duh of course everything would go wrong seems like he did it all right the motherfucker even had  for his legal defense that should get you off in wisconsin that’s like oj money all he needed to get off that he didn’t have was a single black juror that’s all it would’ve took because only a black dude in the united states can look at other dudes and be like “i think the police did this shit” he’s fucked up in the game that’s how oj got off i’ve been watching that new oj show i can’t get enough of that shit doesn’t it bring back good memories but i forgot just how polarizing that oj case was and you know i’ve met oj simpson on four different occasions in my life and before the end of the show i will tell you about each of those occasions the first time i met oj simpson i was in santa monica santa monica yeah i can’t believe a black dude was like “santa monica” you the last n i g g a i would expect to say that let me see your shoes you got some vans on n i g g a what you got “santa monica” you at the time i was  i had done a show and the guy from the club came up and was like “hey oj simpson’s here and he said he wants to meet you” i said “what fuck yeah” i ran down the steps and oj was down there he’s like “hey young man how are you it’s very good to meet you and you’re doing really good work and i hope good things happen for you in your life” i was like “man thanks mr juice” standing beside him was– i don’t know the nice way to say this– his soontobeslain wife ladies and gentlemen man the fuck up or you’re not gonna make it to the end of this show just man the fuck up she’s dead we already know what happened we don’t know who did it but we know what happened i should tell you that woman was very nice to me she actually embraced me she said “i think you’re adorable” and she hugged me she goes “good luck to you” and she held me for a long time and i whispered in her ear “bitch are you trying to get us both killed” i’m just kidding i didn’t say that but… that was the first time in a nutshell it’s good to see so many… so many different people here from so many different ethnicities very diverse crowd looks like you thought bernie sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker but… surprise it’s me yeah yeah you know i’m happy really to see black people come a lot of black people don’t fuck with me like they used to but there’s a few reasons you don’t see black people at my shows one is because obviously black people have slower internet connections i mean that would be my guess i don’t know what– actually my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community i hold so dear a couple of weeks ago i was supposed to be in flint michigan for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in flint i don’t know if you know this but the water in flint is fucking poisonous it’s actually making people sick hollywood people are like “so what at least they have water” but this water– this water is fucked up so a lot of black celebrities flew into flint and they did a tremendous charity benefit and i was on the schedule to appear uh… so the reason a lot of people haven’t heard about this benefit– it was the same day as the oscars right i know so i was on my way to the airport to go to flint and then chris rock calls me and is like “hey dave i got a ticket for you for the oscars can you make it” and i was like “sure n i g g a i’m on my way to the airport right now” come on man what am i gonna do about that water what am i a fucking superhero i need to have fun i need to live too i didn’t fuck that water up stevie wonder was there they didn’t need me i’m sorry everybody i’d never been to the oscars you’ve seen the movies i make i was excited i knew i was gonna get into some trouble because when i was walking on the red carpet the black press came after me “excuse me brother” when you hear somebody call you “brother” too much something terrible is about to happen “excuse me brother brother” and i looked back and the motherfucker had a tuxedo with the kente cloth tie i said “uhoh” he said “i just want to ask you a couple questions” i said “what publication are you with” he said “me i’m with the daily bongo” i said “daily bongo what the fuck who the fuck reads this” he said “listen brother i just want to ask you a quick question you understand that this year this is a boycott for the oscars so i’m just wondering what made you of all people cross the motherfucking picket line and be here tonight” i said “boycott n i g g a i haven’t been working in ten years what do you mean boycott i’ve been on strike y’all n i g g a s didn’t stop working i had to watch fucking key and peele do my show every night so fuck the daily bongo” is what i said i went to the oscars and had a wonderful time i went in that fucking green room it was filled with so many stars i couldn’t even believe what i was seeing hollywood was seducing me all over again i was sitting back there i’m smoking drinking with the stars and then two hollywood movie producers came over right to me “oh my god dave chappelle” said the leader one he was obviously gay some guys you can just tell the other one seemed like a money guy maybe he was from texas or some shit but the gay one was definitely the leader because he did all the talking and then he hit me with “so david um… do you have any movie ideas that you would like to pursue” the truth is i don’t but if you know the game you’re not supposed to tell motherfuckers you don’t have ideas i was like “yeah man i got plenty of ideas” and he called my bluff “really like what” “huh oh um… um…” and then i just started making up shit that i thought maybe he’d like to see i said “i have a superhero idea” he goes “really” i go “yeah he’s a– he’s a gay superhero” he was like “really what’s it called” “huh oh it’s called– it’s called same hero new boots it’s about a gay souschef in san francisco… that gets bit by a radioactive rat on his shift when he’s taking out the trash and is blessed with powers beyond his wildest dreams supersonic gay kind of powers and he starts saving everybody in san francisco but at first he only saves gay people later he saves everybody and the whole city just falls in love with him the only problem is no one remembers him when he saves them” “well i don’t understand why wouldn’t they remember him” i said “because dummy he’s gay he keeps changing his outfit people come up– ‘thanks for saving me sir what’s your name anyway’ he’s like ‘same hero new boots’ and that motherfucker flies away” he was like “i like it a lot” the texan didn’t like that shit at all he was upset “that’s impossible a gay superhero” i said “what well i have others i have a superhero you’d love ’cause he’s stronger than superman and he fights for truth justice and the american way like superman but more than superman he beats up mexicans for no reason” the texan’s like “you got my attention” i’m like “man this motherfucker’s so strong he can fly and do all this great shit only problem with this guy is he can’t even activate his powers unless he touches– unless he touches a woman’s vagina not a long touch just a couple of pats” he said “well what’s the problem with that” i said “the problem sir is that our hero is not a handsome man and he’s often short on cash so whenever trouble breaks out he has to run around the city and convince women to let him pat their vaginas ‘please miss that building’s on fire can i pat your vagina quickly people are dying’ but he can’t tell them exactly why ‘eww get away you’re gross’ ‘please miss people are dying just a couple of pats’ ‘eww gross get away’ so he rapes them i know i know that’s the dilemma for the audience because he rapes but he saves a lot of lives and he saves way more than he rapes and he only rapes to save but he does rape” i didn’t realize it but the whole green room was looking at us all the celebrities were disgusted “ohh” that guy from texas was like “here’s my card call me on monday” that worked out the second time i met oj simpson it was right after the trial of the century there i was now a young man of probably  oj simpson was the most famous or infamous face on planet earth i was in a restaurant in beverly hills with my agents i wasn’t alone in the restaurant but i was alone i was the only black person in the restaurant and in the ’s that felt very uncomfortable now i tend to enjoy it at this age i was having dinner with my agents celebrating a deal that they told me was lucrative but i later learned fucking sucked and suddenly a group of women walked by every race was in that group black white asian latina white white… and white again they were all gorgeous i watched them walk by then i saw a familiar face al cowlings the man from the infamous bronco chase walked by and embraced one of the women and they walked towards the door couldn’t believe what i saw and then close behind him was oj simpson newly released from jail the restaurant fell still i was shocked i didn’t mean to say it out loud but it just came out “oj” he stopped turned around to see who said it saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me i was sitting in the corner of the booth he leaned over all the white people i was having dinner with and shook my hand “how are you young man” he looked in my eyes and i could see in his eyes that he didn’t remember meeting me the first time and then he walked away and i looked back at my agents and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces and the only one with the courage to voice their disgust was a woman named sharon who used to represent me “how could you” she said “how could you shake hands with that murderer” i said “sharon with all due respect that murderer ran for over  yards and he was acquitted so you know fuck it the glove didn’t fit the glove didn’t fit get over yourself” some people can’t do that some people just can’t get over themselves gay people have a hard time doing that recently here we go here comes the deep water no recently i’ve noticed that i noticed it with that manny pacquiao controversy yeah it was– now in the gay community’s defense manny pacquiao said some outlandish shit about gay people very not nice things that i won’t repeat but there was biblical verses and some analogies to animals it wasn’t a good look nike took his shoes immediately which i thought was a little harsh a little harsh you know what i mean just ’cause he’s asian you know what i mean how the fuck are you gonna take the shoes off an asian dude to appease a gay dude you know what i mean no you don’t know what i mean but asian people kind of know what i mean no no asians in the front no no this is what i mean look you’re an asian dude– i say this with no disrespect we’re all americans right and we can agree that america has a huge body count all over the world but nowhere more than asia literally if you look at history recently we have bombed the masculinity out of an entire continent we dropped two atomic bombs on fucking japan and they’ve been drawing hello kitty and shit ever since there’s a lot of ladyboys in the wake of our bombs and i know these things because my wife is asian she’s filipino all right okay so that explains it now you know why you see me at all those filipino events i’m not there picking up pussy i’m dropping some off i take my wife to all that shit i took my wife to see pacquiao fight mayweather we sat ringside okay that– yeah that was a quiet car ride home that’s what that was but if you know what’s popping in the philippines you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the philippines growing up without their mothers yes a lot of women in the philippines go to the arabian peninsula they come to the united states they make all their money here they send all that money back home which is still one of the numberone staples in the philippines’ economy– money that the expats send back to the philippines the men on the other hand are left rearing children twiddling their thumbs waiting on their wives’ checks these men have been fucking emasculated and then suddenly a boxer rises from amongst them and reinstates their manhood with his motherfucking fist this is not the guy you’re supposed to ask “what do you think of homosexuals” he’s not your champ shit that’s why i don’t have a sneaker deal ’cause if you say something that people don’t like they’ll take your fucking shoes off if martin luther king had a sneaker deal we’d still be on the back of the bus it’s true the nike exec would come up– “hi martin uh… we need you to tone down the talk of civil rights and blacks being humans it’s upsetting our southern distributors” “but i don’t understand i thought that’s why i had a sneaker deal in the first place” “not quite really it’s a walking shoe and we like the marching but… try to understand” fuck that shit you know i get it though i understand why gay people are mad and i empathize you know what i’m just telling you this as a black dude i support your movement but if you want to take some advice from a negro pace yourself these things take a while just ’cause they passed the law doesn’t mean they’re gonna like it brown v board of education was in somebody called me a n i g g e r in traffic last wednesday it takes a minute my wife’s friend stewart told me that my wife has a lot of gay friends stewart’s their leader she has a lot of gay friends and i don’t like ’em not ’cause they’re gay i’m just judging them on the merits of their character they’re just not nice dudes they’re fucking rude houseguests they’re sitting on my couch giggling with my wife eating my motherfucking macaroons then i come in and they act like the party’s over “hey stewart what’s going on” this guy talks to me the way a cat would speak if a cat could talk “hi david” “stewart what’s all the beef man what’s going–” he always wants to have some kind of gay political argument the last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words “husband and wife” out of the law i said “why would you want those words out of the law” he said “because it discriminates against samesex couples” i was like “n i g g a s please save me the semantics just trust me take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino you’re about to crap out just go outside talk that over amongst yourselves and whichever one of you is gayer that’s the wife” no no stewart didn’t like that stewart educates me about this movement i didn’t even know shit about it he told me it’s called “lbgtq” i was like “what the fuck is the ‘q’” does that even make sense “q” turns out “q” is like the vowels that shit is sometimes “y” it’s for gay dudes that don’t really know they’re gay like prison fags who are like “what i’m not gay n i g g a i’m just sucking these dicks to pass the time i’m not ‘g’ i’m ‘q’ ugh” i think– okay again of all those letters the “t” has the toughest road ahead in fact i think the “t” should stand for “tough road ahead” they’ve got the longest mental gap to bridge that’s all i’m saying because whenever i see one of them ts on the street i don’t mind them but i’ll be like “man i miss bruce” i’m sorry guys i’m  i remember bruce jenner before the kardashians before all that this motherfucker was a white american superhero it was amazing he was beating africans at track and field we’d never seen anything like it he was on my cereal box growing up you know how much of that cereal i ate n i g g a i didn’t know he was gonna do that i knew before you guys knew i heard things on the street in hollywood you’d just be out see people “hey what’s up kanye why the long face” “n i g g a you’ll see i got two motherinlaws now” and when i heard he was gonna do it i was scared i didn’t think the public was ready i didn’t think the media was ready and you know what i was wrong not only did the public embrace him but the media was nice i’d never seen anything like it “welcome to the world caitlyn so long bruce hello caitlyn” i was shocked is this happening wait a minute is this a time in american history where an american can make a decision for themselves and even though other americans don’t understand it they’ll support it and let this person live a happy life is this what’s happening if it is then good for america that’s dave chappelle the american although dave chappelle the black american he was a little jealous i was like “how the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination olympics” if the police shot half as many transgenders as they did n i g g a s last year there’d be a fucking war in la i know black dudes in brooklyn– hard street motherfuckers– that wear high heels just to feel safe transgenders are gangsters i used to do business with a transgender in hollywood man everybody would be scared of her in the boardroom she’d walk in there newlyminted woman high heels purse wouldn’t say anything to us just walk around the conference table looking mean and shit then she’d walk to the head of the conference table stare at us all reach in her purse pull her old dick out and throw it on the table “let’s talk business gentlemen” “aaah” shit is scary as fuck if your best friend pitched that to you you’d be horrified “yo n i g g a let’s go to the hospital and cut our dicks off and make pussies out of them shits” “what can’t we just get matching jackets or tattoos or something you sure that’s what you want to do” “there’s only way to find out n i g g a wutang pow pow let’s go to the club and trick n i g g a s into fucking us yeah” the third time i met oj simpson— the third time i met oj simpson i was doing great in life i’d just finished the second season of chappelle’s show man those were good days i was playing a comedy club in miami the improv i don’t know if you’ve ever been but if you have you’d know the door for the green room is right on the stage can you imagine such a thing if i walked out of the door of the green room bam i was right here right from the dressing room and i did that i walked out and the whole crowd was like “hooray” and i looked– ma’am as close as you are to me– i saw him as soon as i came out the juice and i saw recognition in his eyes and it filled me with pride that he knew who i was i didn’t acknowledge his presence because it was a white audience and i didn’t want to start a panic but i did my show the show went great i said “good night everyone” they all said “yay” and i didn’t say nothing to oj but i just gave him the signal to let him know i knew he was there and i walked into the green room and oj was already in there i was like “how the fuck is this possible” i was scared and then my friends came in and we all started talking we sat down on the couch and i’m just telling you what i saw with my own eyes you can believe me or not believe me but in my experience oj simpson– one of the nicest men i’d ever met he was nice to me he was nice to my friends the conversation was filled with warmth and levity humor and wisdom we talked for minutes and then suddenly the juice said “you know what i’ve got to be going but it’s good to see you again and i’m glad things went so well” i said “thanks juice” and my friends said “yeah goodbye mr juice” they were new to the game he said “no thank you… for your hospitality good night guys“ and we said “good night” and he just walked out of the room and as soon as the door closed we all looked at each other like “that n i g g a did that shit did you feel that i could feel like… murder in the room” well you young heads missed that shit you’re all too young you don’t remember that how old are you young man you twentyfour twentyfour you don’t know shit you don’t know shit you gotta google shit that i lived through see this is why i lock motherfuckers’ phones up seriously because the young kids you guys need to take a break from that– we all need to break just from that technology just for a minute you know i’m from a different time young man a dark time to you i’m from a time that i didn’t even used to know who was on the phone until i answered the shit like when tragedy used to strike i remember i was  years old and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom you remember these days and she turned it on to one of three channels and she said “class the space shuttle is taking off and we’re all gonna watch it take off” man that shit was going great for like three to five minutes that’s right you remember it fucking exploded right on television everybody on board dead immediately presumed dead it was so bad the teacher looked at all the kids and was like… “you can go home” it was a goddamn national tragedy this was cold war america the russians were laughing at us my point is for a guy your age wouldn’t even know the pain because in your generation it’s like the space shuttle blows up every fucking day how can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing i’m getting over one cop shooting and then another one happens and then another one happens and another one happens i’m crying about paris and then brussels happens i can’t keep track of all this shit so you just give the fuck up that’s the hallmark of your generation and that’s fucked up because your generation lives in the most difficult time in human history this is the age of spin the age where nobody knows what the fuck they’re even looking at did you know that planned parenthood was for abortions it’s for people that don’t plan things out at all that’s right so a guy your age doesn’t really know how he feels are you prochoice are you anticonsequences what does it all really mean it’s easier not to care for you but for us we were trained to care we were raised that way i used to watch a fucking cartoon when i was growing up called care bears it was about a fucking group of teddybear people they were like teddy bears but they were like people and they were all different colors and they all fucking just walked around caring they cared about each other and everything else they all had different designs on their stomachs and the designs told you something about what they might be like inside very very loving group of beings and when shit got real bad as nice as those teddy bears were they didn’t get mean faces they got determined hmm and the leader would say “come on guys it’s time for the care bear stare” remember that shit and them little teddy bears would lock arms… and stare at the problem– and i’m not even bullshitting– actual love would shoot out of their chests… and would dispel anything that was fucked up and when we grew up we wanted to be like those bears and then we got our hearts broken because we found out that life wasn’t gonna let us do that and that it’s impossible to shoot love out of your chest however i have shot love onto somebody’s chest before i do it all the time it’s the next best thing you kids don’t know your generation is just determined to be angry mad everybody’s mad back when we were growing up only black people were mad now everybody’s just trying to get in on the act i try to think to myself “when did everyone get mad” and then i realize this happened before we were born this is a long way to go but… it probably started in the second world war think about it all these black men millions of black men leave the united states for the first time go over to europe with america’s armed forces and fight the nazis and make more money fighting nazis than they ever dreamed they would make in the united states and a lot of those men while they were in europe– just to be real not to be crass– a lot of them probably got their dicks sucked by white women i’m sorry ladies and gentlemen this was world war ii europe and these were desperate times and penises were being sucked for shoelaces and chocolate and very frivolous things and it’s very hard to come back to america and sit on the back of the bus after you’ve been in the south of france getting your dick sucked for a crunch bar or some crazy shit like that that’s a lifechanging experience and while that was happening in europe here in america for the first time women entered the workforce en masse by the millions all the men were gone someone had to run the factory the ladies did it that’s right this was the first generation of american women to have independent income en masse and when the men came back the women weren’t the same american women had grown they were uttering phrases that no woman on earth had ever spoken before things like “no” and “shut the fuck up” and “i don’t feel like it” and then behind the scenes of that there was a littleknown government agency that started testing mind control drugs on the american public they fucked up they tested it for  years they didn’t realize these drugs were not mindcontrolling they were mindexpanding it was lsd and mescaline and shit like that and for the first time there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question the very society they lived in by  the president of the united states was only  years old can you imagine dmx is older than that and he was gonna usher in a new era of peace he was gonna avoid the cold war he was gonna end segregation and they blew his fucking brains out in front of everyone in dallas this country was never the same there were seven more major assassinations in the ’ anyone that stood up and said anything was shot down in the streets like a fucking dog kennedy kennedy king x evers on and on you didn’t even have to be famous you could be a college student at kent state or in mississippi protesting the vietnam war and they shot them too the ’ were a wild era and while all this was going on… bill cosby raped  people holy shit that’s a lot of rapes man this guy’s putting up real numbers he’s like the steph curry of rape man that’s a lot of rapes fiftyfour if he had raped less people… that’s still two dozen rapes don’t forget each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it ladies and gentlemen that’s over hours of rape it only takes hours to get a pilot’s license if rapes were aircrafts this n i g g a is top gun for sure yeah that’s a tough one and i was onstage not too long ago i was in syracuse new york yeah well yeah for syracuse but the show didn’t go so good… all because i was talking about bill cosby a little bit not a little bit i’ll be honest i talked about him for like minutes and a woman stood up in the back of the room and she screamed out “you are a fucking asshole for saying these things” “i know” instantly i felt bad not bad about what i was saying i just felt bad like “oh that’s too bad she doesn’t like the show” i didn’t realize it at first but not only did she say that she was rushing the stage by the time i saw her i just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode i was horrified i said “oh my god i’m gonna kick this bitch in the face” lucky for me i didn’t have to security tackled her but it was a really fucking horrifying scene a scuffle ensued and then finally she screamed out to me “women suffer” i said “i know” and ladies i need you to know… that i know i need you to know seriously there’s a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists i would include myself in that don’t ever forget we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender there’s a lot of men like that in this room there’s a lot of men like that in the world or as we are known on the streets bitchass n i g g a s but as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me i started to take offense and i’ll be honest race was involved she was a young white woman wellintentioned but just not thinking it all the way through “bitch how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination” she didn’t get it she just kept going “women suffer” “i know” “women suffer” “same team” “women suffer” “i know” and this is when she went too far “we suffer just like you” “slow your roll bitch you suffer yes but not like me not like us” she goes “suffering is suffering what’s the difference” i said “come on white woman you know what it is you was in on the heist you just don’t like your cut” you suffer i suffer you suffer i suffer that’s how it works can’t do comparative suffering if you’re hungry and your friend says “you know people are starving in africa” “so what n i g g a i still want lunch” black people know about comparative suffering and you know that it’s a fucking deadend game blacks and jews do that shit to each other all the time you ever played who suffered more with a jewish person it’s a tough game whenever you think you’ve got the jewish guy on the ropes that motherfucker will be like “well don’t forget about egypt” “egypt god damn n i g g a i didn’t know we was going all the way back to egypt” what the fuck is wrong with her what does she think does she think that i don’t know that rape is wrong does she think that maybe i don’t have empathy for bill cosby’s alleged victims and i would be remiss if i didn’t remind you that technically these are all still allegations although i admit it looks very bad perhaps if she looked at it correctly she would have empathy for me the man she was attacking a  black comedian obviously bill cosby was a hero to me and she doesn’t know what it feels like to think that your hero might’ve done something so heinous my god you can’t imagine it’d be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself… had raped  people you’d say to yourself “oh man but i like chocolate ice cream i don’t want it to rape” didn’t want to believe it at first i didn’t believe it i said “these people are obviously trying to destroy dr cosby’s rich legacy” even  allegations into it i was still like “man… he probably only raped ten or  of those people” i know i know but it’s really tough you guys are young imagine if you found out  years from now that kevin hart raped  people you’d be like “oh my god” the only one that would believe that would be katt williams he’d be like “i knew that motherfucker was up to something i knew kevin had raped those people” you know i was mad at kevin too though you know why okay first of all i didn’t even know kevin was as successful as he was i found that shit out the hard way i was at home when my son busted in he said “dad i need ” he’s only years old so i freaked out “what’s going on n i g g a is somebody trying to kill you” he said “no no kevin hart’s coming to town and i wanted to see his show” i said “how much are the tickets” he said “they’re ” i said “god damn mine are only ” i said “why do you need  then” he goes “because i want to go with you dad please and there it is so i took him to the show and we go we sit right up front the lights go down and one opening act after another goes on then kevin takes the stage the crowd goes fucking nuts thousands of people i was furious the longer the show went on the madder i got because his show was fucking outstanding it was maddening these people were fucking holding their stomachs my son was slapping his knee i’m like “damn n i g g a i do this too” kevin says “good night” the crowd goes crazy and then everyone starts walking to his door and the lights come on and then my son is just standing there looking at an empty stage people are pushing past me and nobody’s recognizing me i’m like “man this place fucking sucks” i said “come on son let’s get out of here” then my son looks back at me and says “dad please please i have to meet him” i was like “oh my god” so i took him backstage i’ve known kevin for years but can you believe i was scared to knock on his dressing room door i almost said… “son i haven’t seen him for a long time” and one of kevin’s goons opened the door “hey what’s up dave chappelle what are you doing man it’s good to see you brother what are you doing in this area this is a terrible area” i’m like “actually i live around here listen… is kevin here my son just wanted to meet him real quick” “i don’t know ’cause kevin’s about to eat dinner” just then kevin came around the corner to see who it was “what oh shit what’s up dave come on back i was just about to have dinner i don’t know if you guys ate but you’re welcome to join me if you’d like” and then my son pushed passed me it was some cold shit he goes “actually mr hart we haven’t eaten in several hours” man kevin took us into his back room this guy had a fucking spread it was tuesday night this motherfucker was having sunday dinner there were steaks chops corn with butter all over it my son was eating all fast embarrassing me i was like “slow down son” he was like… then i looked over in the corner and there was a box of custommade jerseys for the local team each one was handstitched and on the back they stitched on “khart” on all of them kevin saw me staring at that box and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys and he walked right to my son he said “hey little man i want you to have this” and my son was like “thanks mr hart” this is when i got mad he goes “if your father ever makes you mad put that on” and he walked out oh that was some cold shit then i realized– i looked up what kevin made on google i couldn’t believe that shit kevin is the first comedian that a drake song could be about kevin could walk around his house and sing “all me” and the whole song would still be true “♪ got everything i got everything ♪\n",

            "[car horn honks] [audience cheering] [announcer] ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage mr. jim jefferies! [upbeat music playing] hello! sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down. [chuckles] thank you, boston. i appreciate that. [whooping] uh, that’s very sweet of you. [man] love you! i’m at the end of the tour right now. i’m very happy to be on tour because i now have a child. ah, so… any time out of home is good for me. um, i got my girlfriend pregnant after knowing her for two months. so… [audience cheering] thank you. thank you. life decisions. and she’s a nice girl, and i love her in a way, sure. my problem with my girlfriend is, she’s very sweet, but she’s shit at telling stories, and i’m awesome at telling stories, so it really bothers me when she talks. and i don’t know if that’ll be a problem in the future, but it’s a problem now and i don’t see it getting better. um… i’ll give you an example, right? i was in the car, and my son hank was asleep in the back seat, and we’re driving along, and on the radio comes madonna, and my girlfriend just slips into conversation, “oh, i used to party with madonna.” and i went, “you fucking what, when?” and she went, “i used to party with madonna.” now, i should fill you in a little bit on this. my girlfriend used to be a model in miami, right? i’m not bragging. i didn’t get the model years. i didn’t get those years. i’ve seen the photos. very impressive. um… so, i said, “so you used to party with madonna. madonna used to have big parties and invite models over, right?” and she went, “no, no, it would just be me and a few other people.” i go, “you need to elaborate on this story right now.” and she goes, “oh, okay, i used to date the center for the miami heat.” as soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an nba center, even if this guy’s even slightly in proportion… a lot of things flood through your head. first thing is, “that’s why your cunt’s so fucked up.” that’s a big one. “that’s why our child came out while you were walking. i understand.” so she said, “i used to date the center for the miami heat. his best friend was dennis rodman. dennis rodman used to go out with madonna, and we used to go over to madonna’s house.” and she goes, “this one time, the four of us were over at madonna’s house, and we were all fucked up on drugs, and one thing led to another…” and then i went, “shut the fuck up!” and she went, “what?” i said, “i know what ‘one thing led to another’ means! you all started fucking each other!” and she went, “we did. we started…” “just shut up!” and she goes, “what do you care for?” i said, “you’re the mother of my child! i don’t wanna picture you being fucked by a 7’2″ nba player while you’re licking out madonna’s muscular vagina and dennis rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock, going…” [moaning] and she goes, “oh, you’re being silly. what do you care for? you’ve partied way more than i have in my life.” and i went, “that is not true. i’ve gotten wasted way more than you have, but i have, in no way, partied way more than you have. often, i get wasted just by myself. i wouldn’t call it a party.” for most of my career, i was a struggling comedian, right? and this is how struggling comedians party, right? it’s 5:00 a.m., monday, right? we’re in a one-bedroom apartment. seven of us are standing around a coffee table, trying to stretch out two grams of coke. one of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories… and the rest of us are talking about where women might be. one of us has come up with a plan. the plan goes like this, “well… nurses will be finishing their shift soon. maybe if we just stand out the front of the er, they’ll appreciate seven funny guys.” [chuckles] i don’t… you know, i’ve never partied like a model. i have partied twice in my life. twice. like, really partied. i’ve had good nights out, but i’ve really partied twice. if you really party, and most people never experience this, it’s an amazing thing. it happens in vegas. it can only happen in vegas, and it’s gotta involve celebrity, right? i’m not famous, but the people around me were super famous, and i was at this party in the night club, and they took me in. and then there’s the night club, but then there’s the real night club out the back, which is, like, the size of this stage. it’s only a little room. and you go back there and you can just… they encourage you to take drugs in the open, and you’re just doing it off a key, [sniffs] and they’re going, “no, dude. use the table. don’t use your…” and i go, “oh, oh. oh, sorry. um…” and it’s confusing at first, and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room. just bring ’em in like, “huh?” and you can do this. you can go… “uh…” like that. and they’ll drag these women away. it is the best thing you’ll ever do with your life. when you party that hard as a man, there’s a lot of remorse ’cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money. you wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover, and you go to your friends. you go, “oh, my god. we partied so hard last night. i spent $5,000.” when a hot girl parties that hard, she wakes up in the morning and goes, “oh, my god. we partied so hard last night. i made $5,000.” and that’s a vastly different emotion that… i don’t think women will never… yeah, okay. this is the thing. in america, at the moment, they’re trying to raise the minimum wage to, i don’t know, $16 an hour or something like that, and whenever they bring up this argument, they always go, “and still to this day, women only earn 70% of what men earn in the workplace.” and of course, that’s disgusting. how dare women earn so much? like… a lot of things that i say tonight will be jokes that i don’t actually mean, but this is something i’m really passionate about. women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace. i’m sorry. i… [audience whooping] i’m not being a misogynistic bastard, right? i’m not saying that women don’t work as hard. i’m sure they do. i’m not saying they don’t do as good a job. what i’m saying is they don’t deserve to earn as much money as men. right? men need that extra 30% to buy meals and drinks and jim jefferies tickets and all that shit! [audience cheering] now… i’m sure there’s women in this room that are saying, “oh, i pay for my drinks. i bought my own ticket.” and don’t think we don’t appreciate the uglies, ’cause we do. right? we do. but there’s little things in society that you can’t change. men have extra expenses that you’ll never understand. there’s holidays that are just for women. like valentine’s day is just for women. they say it’s for romantics. they say it’s for couples or something like that. it’s just for women. there’s no man who gets excited by valentine’s day. there’s no man that when he sees the valentine’s day decorations go up in the shopping mall, he goes, “oh, valentine’s day is coming!” valentine’s day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head, and it goes like this, “how much money do i have to spend today so that you won’t act like a cunt?” it doesn’t stop there. mother’s day! mother’s day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old. my girlfriend’s first mother’s day. and she went, “oh, i wonder what i’ll get for mother’s day.” and i went, “probably fucking nothing. he’s got no money. he’s six months old. what do you think he’s gonna buy you?” within an hour, her friends were over at the house, just by coincidence, telling me what a bad person i was and how important mother’s day is to a new mum, you know? and so, i went and bought her a cappuccino machine ’cause i assumed that’s what hank would have wanted her to have… and i wrote a card. i’m not a bastard. i wrote a card. i’m right-handed. so i got my left hand. every new dad knows this. you get the crayon and you go, [imitating child] “happy mother’s day. love, hank.” and i went, “h-a-n…” and then i did the “k” back-to-front because he’s a fucking moron. see, now i know there’s people in the room, they’re thinking, “well, fathers have father’s day.” father’s day is bullshit. it’s fucking shit, father’s day. father’s day came around and my girlfriend went, “what do you want for father’s day?” and i went, “i don’t want anything. don’t even worry about it. i don’t want anything.” and she goes, “come on. you gotta have something.” i said, “honestly, i don’t want anything.” and she goes, “come on.” and i went, “it’s my fucking money. just don’t touch it. just leave my money alone. how hard is this? how about, for 24 hours, you don’t touch my fucking money? that would be a gift.” that’s why every single father has that one father’s day gift that they cherish, and it’s shit! it’s, like, a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handle’s too big, and it says, “i heart dad.” and they keep that for 20 fucking years, this mug. and do you wanna know why they like it? every now and again, they look at it and go… “that cost me nothing, that mug.” [audience whooping] see… wouldn’t it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff, but didn’t cost anything, that everyone could participate in, right? i’ve got it, right? april 18th… anal sex day. [men cheering loudly] it’s good, isn’t it? everyone’s girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on april 18th. it’s nice. a month before, you’d be walking around the shopping center going, “oh, the decorations are up!” [men whooping] and it’s good ’cause if your bird didn’t take it in the ass, you could do the same thing that women do on valentine’s day when they don’t get a gift. you could go like, “oh, me mate, jason, his wife took it in the ass twice. yeah, obviously, they’re more connected than we are. they’ve, uh…” i’m thinking, i don’t do much merchandise after my shows and stuff, but i’m thinking of bringing out some april 18th t-shirts. not even putting “jim jefferies” on them or anything. just t-shirts that say, “april 18th.” ‘cause it’s good, right? you’re in a bar. you’re a guy. you see a guy at the other end of the bar with an april 18th, and you go… fucking friends for life, right? but even better, you see a girl with an april 18th t-shirt. the weird thing is i’m bigging-up anal sex here, and i don’t even really like fucking girls in the ass that much. i’m not even a huge fan. i much prefer the cunt. i think it’s a much more… i think that a cunt is a much more purpose-built thing to fuck. but, you know, anal sex… oh, you know… i do it. i get involved, ’cause i feel like i have to. you know, i… but i’ve never been a big fan of the ass fucking, i, uh… when i watch it on porn, it seems very inviting. the girl’s taking it so fluently in her ass, and she seems to be having fun, and, uh… but the thing is, you can’t smell porn. you don’t smell porn. you just… you just watch it. they never… and it’s different, porn. it’s different. they clean the girl’s asshole. they pump water into it until it’s very hygienic. i’m sure. and the girl seems to be so happy. she’s like… you’ve got it in her pussy, you’re fucking her, and then she’s like, “put it in my ass.” she’s inviting. it’s like you’re doing her a favor in porn. and then she’s like… she says things… i don’t know, things like, “i’m enjoying that. keep putting it in my ass. fuck my ass. i love a cock in my ass.” and… and the experience i’ve had in my own life has been vastly different. i’ve… my experience has been a lot of crying. now, although that can help you come at times, it’s not what you want… it’s not what you want for every day. i like the girl who acts like she’s enjoying it. like, you know when your girlfriend’s like, “i’m gonna act like i enjoy it.” she does that whole, “yeah. oh, no, that’s good.” [moaning] ahh! ♪ i’m having a good time ♪ and then they’re always going, “are you done? are you close to done?” you never fuck a pussy and they go, “are you almost done? finish this.” like that. if you’re fucking ass, they don’t want you… they want it all over, quick. and they do other things, the porn girls. i don’t know how much they get paid. i’m sure it’s more than what the men get paid. it’s the opposite bit of society. um… but they do a thing called “atm.” i don’t know if you know what that is, kids. that stands for “ass to mouth.” that’s where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus, and she’ll put it directly in her mouth, and she’ll say something like, “i love the taste of my ass. let me taste my ass.” and then the man, as a favor to this woman, puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work… [applause] she’s been doing. now, i had a drunken night with my ex-girlfriend where she thought she’d be all wild and try that. once again, vastly different experience. i’m not a big fan of the ass fucking, and i don’t know of any man, if they’re truthful, really is. now, there’s women in the room who are thinking, “well, why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass?” [woman shouting] what a good question. [woman whoops] women, the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because… we know you fucking hate it. [cheering] so… i’m a father. um… i love my son! i love my son the same way that i love cigarettes. i like to hold him for five minutes every hour, and the rest of the time, i’m thinking about how he’s fucking killing me. he’s a good little boy. no, he’s a great little fella. i really like him. um… my girlfriend super loves him, though. it’s fucking creepy. and… i’m glad i have a son. that worked out good for me. i wouldn’t be a good father to a girl. it wouldn’t be good for me. nothing weird. wouldn’t fuck it. i… i just don’t get along with women. you know how it is. i don’t want them in my house, and… so… because you dream, see… for example, okay? when hank was born… the couple over the road, within two weeks of hank being born, had a baby girl, and rightly or wrongly, the first thing that went through my head was… “aw, that’s great. i hope hank fucks that one day.” that’s what i think… ‘cause that’s what i think about my son. i hope when he’s of age, he just fucks everything. i don’t care if my son is gay or straight. all i care about is, when he is of age, that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires. that is my dream for my son! [audience cheering] but never in the history of fathers and daughters, has a father held his baby girl and gone, “oh, i hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life. i hope you’re never shy of a cock. i hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up.” right, you know… and it’s not just me. women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well. my girlfriend goes to the gym every morning. i go there very occasionally, and when you go to the gym, there’s a little daycare crèche thing in the gym where you can hand your child off, and inside that daycare, there’s, like, three women in their 50s. they’re very nice ladies, and you hand your kid off and he plays. then when you finish your workout, you come and get him. and there’s a woman that works there who just loves my son. she sees all the other kids, but she loves hank, and hank fucking loves her, and the two of them light up when they see each other. and it’s super cute, i bring hank up the stairs, and he starts going, “uh, uh!” trying to reach at her, all right? and she does this, she goes, “everyone, my boyfriend’s here. here’s my boyfriend. give him here. he’s my boyfriend.” and then she kisses him, and she goes, ♪ my boyfriend gives me kisses my boyfriend gives me kisses ♪ it’s fucking adorable. but i tried doing that with a baby girl… let’s say you go to the gym and there’s a daycare, and me and a couple of my mates are working there. “hey, everyone… me girlfriend’s here. give her here. give her here. she’s my girlfriend. my girlfriend gives me kisses. you know that, right? she’s always giving me kisses. enjoy your workout. don’t worry about a thing.” [applause] [cheering] so… also… it’s just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter. it’s just little things. even when they’re babies, it’s just easier. there’s a wiping technique when you’re wiping a baby’s ass. i don’t know if you have children, but this is how you do it. the baby lays on its back. you put their feet together. you lift the feet up, and then you go in and wipe. with a boy, you can wipe like that. up and down, side to side, whatever the fuck you want, right? with a girl, you gotta wipe downward and away. downward and away. it’s very important that you wipe away from the cunt. very important. ‘cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts. they do. they fucking hate it. boys don’t give a shit. fucking… my son will have shit all over his dick and balls, and i’ll be cleaning it off under the foreskin, and he’ll be laughing like it’s the best day ever. even at my age now, i find it funny if i have shit on my dick. if i fuck my girlfriend in the ass, i pull out, i’ve got shit on my dick, i’ll ring me mate jason up and go, “hey, jason… it’s happened again. i got shit on my dick.” and he’ll tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick, and we’ll laugh and laugh and laugh. but never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and she’s thought, “oh, i can’t wait to call karen.” [chuckles] [laughs] when you… when my girlfriend got pregnant… when you meet… when you haven’t got a child, couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children. whenever you meet couples with children they’re always like, “it is the most fulfilling thing i’ve ever done with my life. my heart grows larger and larger every day.” and then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant, those same people went like this, “you’re never gonna sleep again! [laughs maniacally] forget about it. it’s over. you’re not gonna sleep.” they’re constantly telling you you’re not gonna sleep. raising a baby is not that hard. i’ll tell you what, it’s easier than a coke habit. i had a coke habit for seven-and-a-half fucking years! at least it’s not me who wakes up crying anymore! i can sleep through other people crying. i’ve had girlfriends. that’s like white noise to me. i find it soothing. see, me and my girlfriend, just two months, we went, “fuck it! let’s have a kid.” fucking did it, right? these other people, man… you know these couples, and they date from high school, and then they go out for a bit longer, and then after being together for like, seven years, they go, “we’re getting engaged. you wanna come to the party?” and you wanna say, “no, you’re really boring and we hate you.” but you go, “oh, okay, great. you’re still together, are you? you fucked one person, have you? oh, how exciting.” and… and then what they do is they don’t have a kid right away because they’re still not ready. “we have to see how our careers are going and shit.” and what they do is they get a dog, and then they act like the fucking dog’s their baby. they refer to it as their fucking baby. they send you a christmas card of them holding the dog… and it says, “from our family to yours.” and then you have a barbecue, and you invite them, the humans, right? then they come over. this fucking dog runs in, jumping over everything, and you’re like, “what the fuck is this shit?” and they’re like, “we had to bring him. we bring our baby everywhere.” and you go, “well, your baby is biting my actual baby. can you control…” and then, eventually, they decide they’re gonna have a kid ’cause they’ve learned so much from the dog, and then they bring the kid back, and the dog runs up, like, “what’s happening? a new person.” and they’re like, “fuck off. we don’t love you anymore. we’re going.” and they think they’ve learnt something from the dog, and they haven’t learnt anything. what happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the dog dies? you go off, you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog… try to pass it off as the same dog. what happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the baby dies? very hard… to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have. easier if you’re black or asian. [audience cheering] boston, no! no! no! shut up! i will not put up with racism at my shows, okay? i’m not saying ’cause they look the same. i’m saying ’cause they’re easier to purchase. [audience cheering] [audience whooping] if angelina jolie and madonna have taught us anything… it is that you can buy black and asian people. i’m yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from norway with a child, going… “yolanda, quick, get hans. bring him over. come on.” [jeffries chuckles] i’m gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit. uh… gun control. now… no, wait. before you… don’t get excited because the other people have guns. the anti-gun people are like, “yeah! do it, jim!” no, let’s just… [shushes] now, before i start saying this, i wanna say this, right? i believe in your right as americans to have guns. i’m not trying to stop you from having guns. all i’m saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion. my opinion on the… oh, it doesn’t matter. i don’t like guns, right? i’m gonna say some things that are just facts, right? in australia, we had guns, right? right up until 1996. in 1996, australia had the biggest massacre on earth. it still hasn’t been beaten. and… now, after that, they banned the guns. now, in the 10 years before port arthur, there was 10 massacres. since the gun ban in 1996, there hasn’t been a single massacre since. i don’t know how or why this happened, uh… maybe it was a coincidence, right? now, please understand that i understand that australia and america are two vastly different cultures with different people, right? i get it. in australia, we had the biggest massacre on earth, and the australian government went, “that’s it! no more guns!” and we all went, “yeah, all right, then. that seems fair enough, really.” now, in america, you had the sandy hook massacre where little, tiny children died, and your government went, “maybe… we’ll get rid of the big guns?” and 50% of you went, “fuck you! don’t take my guns!” [whooping] so, here’s where it gets confusing, right? now, as i said, i am all for your second amendment rights. i think you should be able to have guns. it’s in your constitution. what i am not for is bullshit arguments and lies. there is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun, and this is the argument… “fuck off. i like guns.” it’s not the best argument, but it’s all you’ve got. and there’s nothing wrong with it. there’s nothing wrong with saying, “i like something. don’t take it away from me.” but don’t give me this other bullshit. the main one is, [in american accent] “i need it for protection. i need to protect me. i need to protect my family.” really? is that why they’re called “assault rifles”? is it? i’ve never heard of these fucking “protection rifles” you speak of. protection? what the fuck are you talking about? you have a gun in your house, you’re 80% more likely to use that gun on yourself, than to shoot someone else. and people think, “well, that’d never happen to me.” you don’t know that, because you know what?\n",

            "protection. i had a break-in in manchester, england, where i was tied up, i had my head cut. they threatened to rape my girlfriend. they came through the window with a machete and a hammer, and americans always go, [in american accent] “well, imagine if you had a gun.” and i’m like, “all right. i was naked at the time. i wasn’t wearing my holster. i wasn’t staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through.” what world do you live in where you’re constantly fucking ready? you have guns ’cause you like guns! that’s why you go to gun conventions! that’s why you read gun magazines! none of you give a shit about home security. none of you go to home security conventions. none of you read padlock monthly. none of you have a facebook picture of you behind a secure door going, “fucking yeah!” like you’re going to be ready if someone comes into your house. you have it at all fucking times. by the way, most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking tv! you think that people are coming to murder your family? how many fucking enemies do you have? jeez, you think a lot of yourself if you think everyone’s coming to murder you. see, if you have it readily available, it becomes unsafe. you have it in your bedside table, one of your kids picks it up, thinks it’s a toy, shoots another one of your kids. happens every fucking day, but people go, “that’d never happen in my house ’cause i’m a responsible gun owner. i keep my guns locked in a safe.” then they’re no fucking protection! someone comes into the house, you’re like, “wait there, fuck-face! oh! you’ve come to the wrong house here, buddy boy. i tell you what. i’m gonna fuck you up! okay. is it 32 to the left or 32 to the right? your mother’s birthday? why the fuck would i know your fucking mother’s birthday? maybe if you didn’t leave the window open [in whining voice] ‘because it’s too hot in here,’ we wouldn’t be getting fucking murdered, right?” i find the nra to be hard work. the fact that they always think the answer is more guns. after sandy hook happened, the nra said, and i quote, “none of this would have happened if the teachers had guns.” i… i think they’re forgetting what school was like. does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to… whenever she came into school, that relief teacher came, you and your friends would see her and go, [chuckling] “oh, we’re gonna make her cry.” and then she’d stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking, and you’d go, “you’re never getting married, are you, miss? never gonna happen for you.” then she’d get back to her 1967 volkswagen beetle, and she’d be crying over the steering wheel, just, “why don’t they like me?” let’s give that cunt a gun and see how things work out! [audience cheering] and then they go, “oh, well, answer to that, we’ll just add more guns.” they go, “we’ll put an armed security guard at every school across america.” yeah, that’ll work out. the average security guard in america earns $16 an hour. not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero! someone comes onto the school and… [mimicking machine gun] and you’ve got kevin. now, i’m sure kevin’s shit-hot at call of duty, but it might not fucking cut it, ladies and gentlemen. now, i understand that when i’m doing this joke in this room, 50% of you agree with me, 50% of you don’t agree with me, and i do respect the people who don’t agree with me. don’t think i don’t. out of the 50% that don’t agree with me, 20% of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and it’s not to be taken seriously, and they’re laughing along ’cause it’s just funny jokes, right? and then the next 20%, have sort of phased out a little bit. they’re looking around, going, “wonder how they got that chandelier up there?” and then… there’s the last 10%. and they’re fucking furious. right now, in this room and the people watching at home… 10% of you are fucking seething. just… and for a couple of reasons. first reason, i’m making good points. [audience cheering] second reason. second reason. second reason, and this is the big one, i’m foreign… and that’s pissing the fuck out of you right now, and your brain is on a loop and you can’t fucking turn it off, and it’s just going around in a circle, and you’re just going, “if you don’t like it, go home! if you don’t like it, go home!” and my answer to that is, “no.” i came here legally. i pay my taxes. i’ll say whatever the fuck i want. your first amendment means that i can say the second amendment sucks dicks. and… unless you’re an american indian, you’re a fucking immigrant as well, so fuck off. people get so precious about it. i understand that to americans, your constitution is very important. i respect it, but please understand that every country has one as well. it’s no more special than any other constitution. we have one in australia. i don’t know what it says. i’ve never seen it. if there’s a problem, we’ll check it, but everything’s going fine. and don’t get me wrong. i get that the constitution is important to you. i have had… fucking, i get it, right? i’ve had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as i’m leaving the theater, going, [in american accent] “you cannot change the second amendment!” and i’m like, “yes, you can. it’s called an ‘amendment.'” if you can’t change something that’s called an “amendment”, see, many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution. and if you don’t know what a thesaurus is, get a dictionary and work your way forward. don’t think your constitution is set in stone. you’ve changed things before. you used to have prohibition in there, right? and then people were like, “hey, who likes getting fucked up? yeah, i like getting fucked up, too. let’s get that one out. let’s get that one out.” you used to have this other thing in america called, uh… slavery! and then lincoln came along and went, “that’s it. no more slaves!” and 50% of you went, “fuck you! don’t take my slaves!” and the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns. “why should i have my slaves taken off me? i’m a responsible slave owner. i’m trained in how to use my slaves safely. just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesn’t mean that my rights should be taken away from me. i… i use my slaves to protect my family! i keep my slaves locked in a safe!” that’s the thing. “why should i have my guns taken off me? i’ve done nothing wrong.” look, i agree with you. if you’re a responsible gun owner and you don’t fuck around with them, then you should be allowed your guns. you really should. but that’s not how society works. we have to play to the 1% that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us. we have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving, right? i take drugs like a fucking champion, right? [audience cheering] we should all be allowed to take fucking drugs, but we can’t, can we? because sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids. oh! “oh, thanks, sarah. you fucked it up for everyone.” right? everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it, right? but we can’t because jonathan got drunk and ran over a family. “thanks, jonathan! now i have to drive at 30, you fucking idiot!” see, that’s the thing. “why should i have my guns taken off me, i’m responsible, just because that guy’s crazy?” who’s to say you’re not crazy? that’s the thing about crazy people. they don’t know they’re crazy. that’s what makes them crazy. the only thing you know for sure on this earth is, “i think, therefore i am.” you know that you exist. anything past that is open to interpretation, right? you know you exist and that’s it. right now, i think i’m in boston talking to 1,200 people. that’s what i think i’m doing, but there is a good to fair chance that i’m in a mental home, standing in front of a white wall, going, [slurring speech] “i hate guns. i hate guns. i hate guns.” [audience applauding] see, one of the better arguments is, “well, if you take the guns away, then only the criminals will have guns.” not true. when they banned the guns in australia, it worked. when they banned them in britain, it worked, okay? the bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in sandy hook costs, like, $1,000 american and you can buy it in walmart. it’ll be delivered to your house. that’s it, man. 1,000 bucks, right? that same gun in australia on the black market costs $34,000. now if you have $34,000, you don’t need to be a criminal. you’ve got $34,000. you’re a great little saver. keep going. so that covers the criminals, but that doesn’t cover the people who wanna murder your family, that are coming after you and your family. it kind of does. the people who do the massacres, it covers them ’cause they go… the kid at colorado who thought he was the joker, let’s say that he had some social issues. the kid at sandy hook was asperger’s as fuck. right? i don’t know if you know a lot about the black market, but you can’t just rock up at the docks going, [slurring speech] “guns! who wants to sell me a gun?” now, i’m gonna wrap this up. we won’t talk about it anymore. now… see, the one thing that i do really agree with with the right to bear arms, i really agree with… that the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government. in case the government became a bunch of cunts, you could all get your guns and fight back, and that’s why it was written. – [audience cheering] – yeah! and that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets. but you do know the government has drones, right? you get that? you’re bringing guns to a drone fight! if we went back to muskets, i’m all for it! keep the second amendment. if we all have muskets… muskets are awesome! every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times. you know what’s good about the musket? it gives you a lot of time to calm down. someone calls your wife fat, and you’re like, “fuck you, buddy! ah, you’re not a bad guy. you’re all right.” now… after the show, we’re gonna go out, have a big party around boston, see how it goes. i’m not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore. my girlfriend has said that’s a no… ’cause i don’t behave myself in there, so i’m not allowed to go to them anymore. ‘cause strip clubs aren’t what women think they are. [stammers] it used to be like… okay, so, when a man goes to a strip club, it’s all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible. that’s what men want to see. women, when they go to their magic mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are… women wanna see a guy, “hey, ladies. he’s a fireman.” and he comes out with his hose and like that… and whenever a stripper takes their clothes off, they’ve still got the fireman’s hat on or a tool belt on or policeman’s gun on a holster, right? because even when a man’s naked, a woman wants to know that he has a job. when men watch strippers, we want them to have a job, and that job’s stripping. we want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money, and just go… “you can’t take care of your kids.” it’s… and when men get private dances in these strip clubs, i don’t know… i don’t know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms, but basically, it’s dry humping. there’s no dancing. the girl gets in front. she gets where your cock is, pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it… and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face, and you go… that’s what a private “dance” is, right? i don’t know if there’s private dancing in female strip clubs. [stammering] i can’t imagine that there would be. i don’t imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going… she goes, “how was it?” and she goes, “well… he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals… and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead. i got to go to the atm.” so legit got canceled. [audience booing] yeah. i know. i know it. who would’ve thought it would’ve struggled on that great fxx channel that everyone knew about? the first season is on netflix. this special is being recorded for netflix. so you can go watch it there if you’re watching the special. it was… i’m very proud of it. we had two great seasons of really good television, and if people didn’t… now… the whole tv show is based around one standup routine that i used to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that i took to a brothel, which is a true story. and so, when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who… in the end, we used dj qualls, and dj qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie road trip. he’s the skinny white guy out of the movie hustle & flow, and he’s the white guy out of the movie hustle & flow. now… the great thing about dj is… he already looks disabled. he has that “latter stages of aids” thing going on. it’s great for casting. anyway, but… i didn’t want dj to begin with. i wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic, and the actors’ union of america said, “you cannot do that.” because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy, i think, are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired. and i said, “all right, what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer?” and they sent me a list. and on this list, i said, “can you get rid of all the contagious ones? and what have we got left?” so i saw every disabled actor in hollywood, and i’ll be honest with you, not that many of them. i don’t know why. maybe they’re just lazy. they don’t wanna work. maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly. and none of them were very good, either. everyone we saw, none of them were very good ’cause acting is all about what you do with your hands. none of them knew what to do with their hands, and… they all came in. until this one guy came in. i had seen a lot of people that day. this guy was the most disabled person i’d ever seen in my life. he was like… think of the most disabled person you’ve seen, then double it. …really super disabled. he was shaped like a pretzel. he was being carried in by this big russian nurse, carried him in. he made that great disabled sound of… [groans] that one. i just loved him. anyway… so he comes in for the audition… and i’m sitting there, and we’re doing the lines together, and at first, i didn’t know if he was mentally all there either, so i was being a little bit patronizing. i was going, “thank you so much for coming in.” and then we did the dialog together, and i didn’t have to worry about a thing. this kid was funny. he was smart. his timing was impeccable. i thought he was just great, and i helped him out of the room, and i come back to the director and i said, “that’s our guy. that’s who we gotta pick.” and he agreed, but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room. so the next bloke wheels himself in. now, obviously, he’s just a paraplegic if he’s wheeling himself in, which means the waist down, and that didn’t really suit me because… paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance. but i thought… “if he’s a good enough actor, maybe he can quad-up for the role.” so he comes in… he comes in, i shake his hand, and his leg slightly comes out at the same time. and i went, “whoa! what’s going on there, kicky?” and he goes… “oh, you got me! i’m not disabled.” and i said, “you’re fucking what now?” and he goes, “i’m not disabled. i just really wanted the role, so i rented a wheelchair.” and i said, “just shut up. so let me… this is how your day has mapped-out thus far. you woke up this morning. you drove to the wheelchair rental place. you rented a wheelchair. you carried it out, i assume. you put it in the trunk of your car. you drove here. you got the wheelchair out. you carried it up three flights of stairs. you went to the waiting room. you put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse. then you sat in it and practiced your lines.” and he went… “yeah.” and i said, “you’re a fucking asshole, mate. get the fuck out of here.” and i kicked him out. and later on that day, i’m sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors i’m gonna call to tell them they’ve got parts, and i’m holding this disabled guy’s headshot, and i just think, “i’m gonna call this guy up. i’m gonna change his life. this is an awesome moment, right?” and i’m looking at it, and he looks super handsome in his headshot. he looked really like… and i thought, “this has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history.” the shutter on his camera has gotta be like… [mimicking camera shutter] like… [audience applauding] and then i read the guy’s biography… and then it dawned on me. “this guy’s not disabled either! i hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair! this cunt rented a nurse!” do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse? i’m all for a method actor. get into character three hours before, but once you finish the audition, stand up and go, “ta-da!” and we would have gone, “that was very good.” but i’ll tell you what you don’t do. don’t make me carry you to your car! i carried him down three flights of stairs going, “you did very good.” he’s like, “thank you, jim.” [laughing] [chuckles] i was, uh… i go to a therapist… ’cause i get depressed. so i got a therapist every now and again. i literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like, “i’m gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind.” like just out of the movies, right? and she went, “red,” and i went, “blue.” and then she went, “cooking,” and i went, “food,” and all that type of stuff. we went like this forever. and then she went… for the last question, she went, “and what’s your favorite thing in the world?” and i went… “coming on a girl’s face.” now… now, i could’ve said things like… “ice cream” is a good answer. “hank” would’ve been an excellent answer. but i said, “coming on a girl’s face.” and i’ve had six months to think about my answer, and i stand by it. – i… – [cheering] i’m not proud of it. i hate myself for thinking it. it’s such a horrible thing to do to another human. when a girl’s on her knees and you… it’s so… and as an atheist, i believe in darwin and all the things that he wrote, but he never had a bit where he explained that. there was never a bit in his book where he went, “when a caveman loves a cavewoman, he’ll ejaculate on her face so that flies won’t come near.” there was never that… never that moment. but, by golly, if it’s not fun. i find it… to… look, to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time, may i say, “bravo!” don’t… don’t think what you do… has gone unnoticed. we notice. we appreciate your work. i think you deserve a parade of some kind. during memorial day, after the vietnam vets, before the first gulf war guys, we could bring in, “and here’s the women who take a load on their face.” and you could march out, and married men would stand there going, “god bless you, ladies.” [audience cheering] i enjoy your acting that you do. the standard tongue out and the… like that… i don’t know why, but i enjoy… i know it’s a lie. i know you’re not excited, but i still appreciate the effort is what i enjoy. i love the look because it’s such a, “oh, jeez, i’m excited, too. when this come hits my face, there’s a good chance i’ll also orgasm. anything could happen in this crazy world.” but this is what redeems us as men. this is what redeems us. just know that the second the come shoots out of our cock and hits your face, our bodies flood with remorse. the next 20 seconds is the nicest we will ever be to you. [men whooping] i go from being an animal to the sweetest guy on earth. i’m like, “you fucking slut… oh, i love you. ah… uh, all right. no, no, no. put your tongue back in. um… keep your eyes shut. just keep them shut. uh… all right, i’m going to get a towel. i’ll get a towel. i’ll get you a towel. all right. you’re a wonderful mother to our child.” [laughs] [audience cheering] see… this is what kills me. my son will one day watch this dvd. and i’m the guy who’s meant to teach him right from wrong, and i’m there wiping come off his mother’s face. i think i did something illegal with my son the other day. i think it might be illegal. tell me if this is illegal. all right? i’m in the shower. my girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning, and when she came back, i was in the shower, and hank ran up, and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like, “argh!” like that. and i went… [vocalizing] and i saw his little face and i went, “hello, hankie.” and then in the condensation, i drew a little bowtie on him… and a little suit… and then i gave him a voice bubble that said, “i love my daddy. love, hank.” but i did it so i could read it. well, of course he could read the “k,” and… then i stepped out. i stepped out of the bathroom and i went, “g’day, hankie!” and he slapped my cock and he ran off. now, is that illegal? i don’t know. is it illegal because, a, a child touched my cock, or because, b, i found it really funny and i’ve been telling everyone. and i can’t get angry at him because his whole life, he’s been lying on mats with things dangling over. he’s been training for this his entire life. i think i’ve, uh… i think i’ve become american, more american than i am australian lately, and there was a moment where i tipped over where i went, “oh, i think like an american person now.” and i’m happy to do it. i just… i’ll tell you what happened. i was flying around… i was doing a tour of australia, and i was flying domestically around australia, and i’m so used to airports and stuff here in america that… okay, what happens is, when you go… i was flying sydney to melbourne. when you fly domestically in australia, you go up to the machine, put your name in, prints your ticket out, it prints your bag thing, you put the bag thing on your bag yourself, and then there’s a conveyor belt underneath. you throw your bag on. bag fucks off. you don’t speak to anyone. then i go up to the gate bit, and the lady’s going, “tickets, please.” and i’m holding my id out like a fucking simpleton. ‘cause i get through airports quick, man. i’m like, “fucking there you go.” and she went, “put your id away. i don’t need to see that.” and i went… “i think you do.” and she went, “i don’t… why would i need to see your id?” and i said, “i might be a terrorist.” and she went, “would showing me your id stop you from blowing the plane up?” “no, i’d probably still blow the plane up.” so then i get up to the tsa conveyor belt thing, and i’m so good at the airports. i’m already taking my shoes off as i’m walking, right? and all the australians behind me assume that i’m american, and they’re losing their fucking shit. they’re like, “oh, for fuck’s sake! one of these cunts, eh?” and the tsa guy goes, “hey, mate, what are you taking your shoes off for?” and i went… [shouting] “i don’t know! maybe they’re bombs?” and he went… “but they’re not, are they?” i put me shoes back on. i get my laptop out. everyone’s going mental. and the tsa guy says, very politely, but extraordinarily sarcastically, he goes, “jeez, mate. that’s a nice computer. why are you showing it to everyone?” “it might also be a bomb.” and then the guy said the most australian thing i’ve ever heard come out of anyone’s mouth ever. he went… “oh, come on, mate. you wouldn’t have two bombs.” [audience laughing] [chuckles] i’m not even quite sure what that means, but it does make some type of sense. all right. oscar pistorius. if you haven’t been following the case, you’re missing out. this is the greatest thing since oj simpson. you’re fucking missing out, mate. if you don’t know who oscar pistorius is, let me fill you in. oscar pistorius is a legless man from south africa, known as the blade runner. he ran in two olympics, the disabled and the able-bodied olympics in one year. no one has ever done that. he’s an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and able-bodied people alike, and on valentine’s day last year, he shot and killed the hottest girl on earth… and that’s when he became an inspiration to me… ’cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long. let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there. you can’t just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want. [mock tearfully] people have feelings, you cunts. now, there’s a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day. one of the theories is that they found in her phone… he went through her phone, and on her phone, he found some text messages from a south african rugby player on valentine’s day, right? now, i don’t know if you’ve ever been to south africa, but in south africa, rugby is more popular than legless running. it goes, rugby, legless running, cricket. legless running’s their second sport. you wouldn’t have thought that. anyway… i’m going to reenact what i believe happened that day. to do that, i will now be doing a south african accent. now i know, many of you can’t tell the difference between my accent and a south african accent. here’s the difference. picture my accent, but i’m punching a black person. what i’m trying to say is south africans are horrible people. so… she’s coming out of the shower. she’s been drying her hair. she’s listening to rodriguez or something. she comes out. he’s laying on the bed. he looks up at her, he’s holding the phone, and he goes, [in south african accent] “what the fuck is this? i’ve been through your phone. you have been texting a rugby player.” and she’s like, “oh! fuck you! who the fuck do you think you are?” “who am i? i’m oscar pistorius, the greatest legless runner that has ever been. that’s who the fuck i am.” “well, i would rather be with a rugby player. at least he is a whole man, not a three-quarter man like you.” – [audience exclaiming] – i know. [audience laughing] “oh! fuck you!” “no! fuck you! i’m leaving you!” and then she storms out of the room, and then he was like… “you fucking bitch! [grunts] i hate you! [grunting] you will rue the day… that you left oscar pistorius, the blade runner! don’t go anywhere! [grunting] i hate you!” that’s where he keeps his legs. all right. then he put the blades on. “oh, you’re in trouble, missy. i tell you. i go to my gun safe.” she locked herself in the bathroom. he shot her through the bathroom door. seems like overkill, doesn’t it? bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them, but oscar’s one of the few men on earth that couldn’t kick the door in, right? he was wearing the blades, so… boing! ah! so… i think oscar will probably go to prison. now… in south africa, one in four people have aids. i assume it may even be worse in the prison population. now, can i say this? look… i’ve never raped a man. i hate that i have to put “a man” in that sentence, but whatever. i’ve never raped a man, but… if i was going to rape a man, it would be a legless olympian… ’cause in prison, it’s all about getting one up on other people, and making people think you’re tough and all that. like, “you want to fucking rape me? i just raped an olympian, bitch. is that what you fucking want?” there’d be a wonderful moment… when you’re in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a terminator movie. [chuckling] you know what i like about that joke? so often when you tell a joke, the rapist is the villain in the story, but not in that one. not in that one. he’s the hero. all right, we have to get going soon. before i leave, – i thank you very much for coming. – [audience groaning] no, i said, “soon,” not “over.” it’s just soon, you cunts, so calm down. [chuckles] [man whistles] i always… i always find that weird when someone, like, whistles like that. what do they think is going to happen? like, i’m going to go, “fucking you know me, mate. i was enjoying claps and cheers, but what i needed was a high-pitched squeal noise. thank god you came along to pick up my spirits.” [man] love you! all right, final story. now, i was in south africa again. jeez, i don’t think i’ll be working in south africa after this special comes out. i used to do, like, one tour in south africa every year, and i just don’t know if i’ll be invited this time. they’ll be like, [in south african accent] “we don’t like him. he’s no good.” anyway, so, i’m in south africa, and i had to fly back from cape town to los angeles, which is, like, a 26-hour flight. you’ve to go up to london and go across. cunt of a trip. um… but it was all right ’cause i had a business class ticket, so i didn’t give a fuck. and when i travel economy, i try to dress up nice ’cause i like to look good in case someone recognizes me and i might get an upgrade. but when i’ve already got a business class ticket, i try to look like a bag of shit… ’cause it’s important to me that everyone else in business class doesn’t want me there and they’re annoyed by my presence. so… i’m wearing a white t-shirt that’s got brown stains on it with a hole in the side. i’m wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out. so, anyway, i go up to the counter, up to the business thing with the thing, and i go, “hello,” and the lady goes, [in south african accent] “oh, mr. jefferies, i’m so sorry, but you have been downgraded.” i said, “you what now?” she goes, “business class is full. you have been downgraded.” and i said, “i understand that business class is full. i bought one of the tickets that made it full.” and she went, “i’m sorry, sir. there’s nothing i can do.” and then i just went, “are you fucking kidding me?” now, you know when you’re dealing with customer service people, and they want you to swear, ’cause as soon as you swear, they don’t have to engage with you anymore. they can act like they’re the first adult never to hear a swear word, and they can get really offended, right? so i went, “are you fucking kidding me?” and she went, “please do not speak to me that way! i have done nothing wrong!” and i said, “are you, a white south african, telling me you’ve done nothing wrong?” anyway… tensions rose. the manager comes over. big fat cunt called simon fulcher, right? he walks over and goes, [in south african accent] “what is wrong here? what is wrong?” and i said, “i bought a business class ticket and i want a business class ticket.” and he goes, “what do you want me to do? make a new chair for you? there are no more seats. i can’t do anything.” he goes, “i’ll tell you what i can do. go up to the executive lounge. have some peanuts. enjoy a beverage. listen to rodriguez, and if something opens up, we will move you back up to business class. so i thought, “there’s nothing i can do.” so i walk off with my ticket. i’m walking through the airport like, “fucking british airways, bunch of fucking cunts.” right? i get up to the counter. and the woman behind the counter said, “tickets, please.” and i hand over my ticket and she goes, [in south african accent] “i’m sorry, sir, but this is for business class passengers only. your ticket says ‘economy’ on it.” and i said… [inhales sharply] “i bought a business class ticket, but you people have downgraded…” and as i was doing my little speech, she looked past me and went, “next.” [audience exclaiming] “listen here, you fucking cunt.” [audience laughing] all right? now, you say “cunt” in any foreign country, people lose their fucking shit. security came from everywhere. i was going, “don’t you fucking come near me, cunt!” and i said, “i want to speak to simon fulcher,” like i’m… and they go, “all right.” they ring the manager up, and then they go… he goes, “is it the pale australian man?” and the guy went, “yes.” he goes, “we’ve had problems with him. let him through.” right? so i go through. i’m sitting there, i’m eating my peanuts. and i’m just angry now, going, “fucking british airways. fucking cunts, fucking…” like that. and in walks in a group of americans, about 30 of them. you know the type, right? they all… and whenever i see americans abroad… i’ll do my impersonation of any american abroad. when americans are abroad, you’re just pointing out shit you see. you’re just walking around going, [in american accent] “oh, this is great! look at that. that’s a chair right there. okay. oh, what’s that over there? okay. wonderful. great.” right? and this group walked in, and one of the women in the group went like this, she went, [in american accent] “did anyone else see that australian guy speaking to that lady out there? some people have no class.” and i put my head around the pylon, and i went, “you can fuck off and all! you don’t know what i’ve been through! i’ve been downgraded!” and as i said that, 18 other people who were given the same lie that i was given, that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class, the penny dropped. none of us are getting promoted. they all lied to us, and we formed an angry militia in seconds. it was like a scene out of braveheart, and they all stood up and went, “fucking downgraded!” and the woman in the group was doing this, “don’t speak to me that way. who the hell do you think you are?” and all the men in the group were like, “hey, why don’t you shut the fuck up? just shut the fuck up.” ♪ it doesn’t matter these people seem very angry, so ♪ and a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down. and, sometimes, americans, sometimes, you can seem a little insincere. and he came up and he went, [in american accent] “hey. hey. yeah, i get it. [exhales sharply] downgraded, yeah. that really grinds my gears, i tell you that. yeah, i would write a strongly-worded letter. i really would.” and then i thought, at least this guy’s being nice, and i said, “look, mate, don’t worry about it. it’s not like it’s your fault.” and i said, “why are you in such a big group anyway?” and he goes, “oh, we’re in neil diamond’s band. that’s neil diamond’s backup singer you just called a cunt there.” and as he said that, neil diamond walked around the corner like a fucking superhero… and i reacted like he was one. i went, “neil diamond!” and neil diamond went, [in husky voice] “hey, what’s going on?” and then, for a second there, there was a bit of my brain that thought maybe neil diamond could solve problems. and i went, “neil! me and all these people, we’ve been downgraded!” and neil went, “oh! oh, right. uh, well, maybe that’s our fault. we decided to come back a day early.” “you can fuck off and all, neil diamond!” and then a fight breaks out amongst the neil diamond band and the downgraded. punches are thrown. not by me. i don’t know if you have the internet, but i’m not much of a fighter. i’m an excellent scurrier-awayer. i get down. “hey, what have you got there? hiya!” anyway, the airport police came. three people were arrested from the downgraded… but three people were arrested from the neil diamond band, and that meant that three seats opened up in business class.

            "   ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage mr. jim jefferies!  hello! sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down.  thank you, boston. i appreciate that.  uh, that’s very sweet of you.  love you! i’m at the end of the tour right now. i’m very happy to be on tour because i now have a child. ah, so… any time out of home is good for me. um, i got my girlfriend pregnant after knowing her for two months. so…  thank you. thank you. life decisions. and she’s a nice girl, and i love her in a way, sure. my problem with my girlfriend is, she’s very sweet, but she’s shit at telling stories, and i’m awesome at telling stories, so it really bothers me when she talks. and i don’t know if that’ll be a problem in the future, but it’s a problem now and i don’t see it getting better. um… i’ll give you an example, right? i was in the car, and my son hank was asleep in the back seat, and we’re driving along, and on the radio comes madonna, and my girlfriend just slips into conversation, “oh, i used to party with madonna.” and i went, “you fucking what, when?” and she went, “i used to party with madonna.” now, i should fill you in a little bit on this. my girlfriend used to be a model in miami, right? i’m not bragging. i didn’t get the model years. i didn’t get those years. i’ve seen the photos. very impressive. um… so, i said, “so you used to party with madonna. madonna used to have big parties and invite models over, right?” and she went, “no, no, it would just be me and a few other people.” i go, “you need to elaborate on this story right now.” and she goes, “oh, okay, i used to date the center for the miami heat.” as soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an nba center, even if this guy’s even slightly in proportion… a lot of things flood through your head. first thing is, “that’s why your cunt’s so fucked up.” that’s a big one. “that’s why our child came out while you were walking. i understand.” so she said, “i used to date the center for the miami heat. his best friend was dennis rodman. dennis rodman used to go out with madonna, and we used to go over to madonna’s house.” and she goes, “this one time, the four of us were over at madonna’s house, and we were all fucked up on drugs, and one thing led to another…” and then i went, “shut the fuck up!” and she went, “what?” i said, “i know what ‘one thing led to another’ means! you all started fucking each other!” and she went, “we did. we started…” “just shut up!” and she goes, “what do you care for?” i said, “you’re the mother of my child! i don’t wanna picture you being fucked by a 7’2″ nba player while you’re licking out madonna’s muscular vagina and dennis rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock, going…”  and she goes, “oh, you’re being silly. what do you care for? you’ve partied way more than i have in my life.” and i went, “that is not true. i’ve gotten wasted way more than you have, but i have, in no way, partied way more than you have. often, i get wasted just by myself. i wouldn’t call it a party.” for most of my career, i was a struggling comedian, right? and this is how struggling comedians party, right? it’s 5:00 a.m., monday, right? we’re in a one-bedroom apartment. seven of us are standing around a coffee table, trying to stretch out two grams of coke. one of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories… and the rest of us are talking about where women might be. one of us has come up with a plan. the plan goes like this, “well… nurses will be finishing their shift soon. maybe if we just stand out the front of the er, they’ll appreciate seven funny guys.”  i don’t… you know, i’ve never partied like a model. i have partied twice in my life. twice. like, really partied. i’ve had good nights out, but i’ve really partied twice. if you really party, and most people never experience this, it’s an amazing thing. it happens in vegas. it can only happen in vegas, and it’s gotta involve celebrity, right? i’m not famous, but the people around me were super famous, and i was at this party in the night club, and they took me in. and then there’s the night club, but then there’s the real night club out the back, which is, like, the size of this stage. it’s only a little room. and you go back there and you can just… they encourage you to take drugs in the open, and you’re just doing it off a key,  and they’re going, “no, dude. use the table. don’t use your…” and i go, “oh, oh. oh, sorry. um…” and it’s confusing at first, and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room. just bring ’em in like, “huh?” and you can do this. you can go… “uh…” like that. and they’ll drag these women away. it is the best thing you’ll ever do with your life. when you party that hard as a man, there’s a lot of remorse ’cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money. you wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover, and you go to your friends. you go, “oh, my god. we partied so hard last night. i spent $5,000.” when a hot girl parties that hard, she wakes up in the morning and goes, “oh, my god. we partied so hard last night. i made $5,000.” and that’s a vastly different emotion that… i don’t think women will never… yeah, okay. this is the thing. in america, at the moment, they’re trying to raise the minimum wage to, i don’t know, $16 an hour or something like that, and whenever they bring up this argument, they always go, “and still to this day, women only earn 70% of what men earn in the workplace.” and of course, that’s disgusting. how dare women earn so much? like… a lot of things that i say tonight will be jokes that i don’t actually mean, but this is something i’m really passionate about. women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace. i’m sorry. i…  i’m not being a misogynistic bastard, right? i’m not saying that women don’t work as hard. i’m sure they do. i’m not saying they don’t do as good a job. what i’m saying is they don’t deserve to earn as much money as men. right? men need that extra 30% to buy meals and drinks and jim jefferies tickets and all that shit!  now… i’m sure there’s women in this room that are saying, “oh, i pay for my drinks. i bought my own ticket.” and don’t think we don’t appreciate the uglies, ’cause we do. right? we do. but there’s little things in society that you can’t change. men have extra expenses that you’ll never understand. there’s holidays that are just for women. like valentine’s day is just for women. they say it’s for romantics. they say it’s for couples or something like that. it’s just for women. there’s no man who gets excited by valentine’s day. there’s no man that when he sees the valentine’s day decorations go up in the shopping mall, he goes, “oh, valentine’s day is coming!” valentine’s day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head, and it goes like this, “how much money do i have to spend today so that you won’t act like a cunt?” it doesn’t stop there. mother’s day! mother’s day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old. my girlfriend’s first mother’s day. and she went, “oh, i wonder what i’ll get for mother’s day.” and i went, “probably fucking nothing. he’s got no money. he’s six months old. what do you think he’s gonna buy you?” within an hour, her friends were over at the house, just by coincidence, telling me what a bad person i was and how important mother’s day is to a new mum, you know? and so, i went and bought her a cappuccino machine ’cause i assumed that’s what hank would have wanted her to have… and i wrote a card. i’m not a bastard. i wrote a card. i’m right-handed. so i got my left hand. every new dad knows this. you get the crayon and you go,  “happy mother’s day. love, hank.” and i went, “h-a-n…” and then i did the “k” back-to-front because he’s a fucking moron. see, now i know there’s people in the room, they’re thinking, “well, fathers have father’s day.” father’s day is bullshit. it’s fucking shit, father’s day. father’s day came around and my girlfriend went, “what do you want for father’s day?” and i went, “i don’t want anything. don’t even worry about it. i don’t want anything.” and she goes, “come on. you gotta have something.” i said, “honestly, i don’t want anything.” and she goes, “come on.” and i went, “it’s my fucking money. just don’t touch it. just leave my money alone. how hard is this? how about, for 24 hours, you don’t touch my fucking money? that would be a gift.” that’s why every single father has that one father’s day gift that they cherish, and it’s shit! it’s, like, a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handle’s too big, and it says, “i heart dad.” and they keep that for 20 fucking years, this mug. and do you wanna know why they like it? every now and again, they look at it and go… “that cost me nothing, that mug.”  see… wouldn’t it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff, but didn’t cost anything, that everyone could participate in, right? i’ve got it, right? april 18th… anal sex day.  it’s good, isn’t it? everyone’s girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on april 18th. it’s nice. a month before, you’d be walking around the shopping center going, “oh, the decorations are up!”  and it’s good ’cause if your bird didn’t take it in the ass, you could do the same thing that women do on valentine’s day when they don’t get a gift. you could go like, “oh, me mate, jason, his wife took it in the ass twice. yeah, obviously, they’re more connected than we are. they’ve, uh…” i’m thinking, i don’t do much merchandise after my shows and stuff, but i’m thinking of bringing out some april 18th t-shirts. not even putting “jim jefferies” on them or anything. just t-shirts that say, “april 18th.” ‘cause it’s good, right? you’re in a bar. you’re a guy. you see a guy at the other end of the bar with an april 18th, and you go… fucking friends for life, right? but even better, you see a girl with an april 18th t-shirt. the weird thing is i’m bigging-up anal sex here, and i don’t even really like fucking girls in the ass that much. i’m not even a huge fan. i much prefer the cunt. i think it’s a much more… i think that a cunt is a much more purpose-built thing to fuck. but, you know, anal sex… oh, you know… i do it. i get involved, ’cause i feel like i have to. you know, i… but i’ve never been a big fan of the ass fucking, i, uh… when i watch it on porn, it seems very inviting. the girl’s taking it so fluently in her ass, and she seems to be having fun, and, uh… but the thing is, you can’t smell porn. you don’t smell porn. you just… you just watch it. they never… and it’s different, porn. it’s different. they clean the girl’s asshole. they pump water into it until it’s very hygienic. i’m sure. and the girl seems to be so happy. she’s like… you’ve got it in her pussy, you’re fucking her, and then she’s like, “put it in my ass.” she’s inviting. it’s like you’re doing her a favor in porn. and then she’s like… she says things… i don’t know, things like, “i’m enjoying that. keep putting it in my ass. fuck my ass. i love a cock in my ass.” and… and the experience i’ve had in my own life has been vastly different. i’ve… my experience has been a lot of crying. now, although that can help you come at times, it’s not what you want… it’s not what you want for every day. i like the girl who acts like she’s enjoying it. like, you know when your girlfriend’s like, “i’m gonna act like i enjoy it.” she does that whole, “yeah. oh, no, that’s good.”  ahh! ♪ i’m having a good time ♪ and then they’re always going, “are you done? are you close to done?” you never fuck a pussy and they go, “are you almost done? finish this.” like that. if you’re fucking ass, they don’t want you… they want it all over, quick. and they do other things, the porn girls. i don’t know how much they get paid. i’m sure it’s more than what the men get paid. it’s the opposite bit of society. um… but they do a thing called “atm.” i don’t know if you know what that is, kids. that stands for “ass to mouth.” that’s where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus, and she’ll put it directly in her mouth, and she’ll say something like, “i love the taste of my ass. let me taste my ass.” and then the man, as a favor to this woman, puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work…  she’s been doing. now, i had a drunken night with my ex-girlfriend where she thought she’d be all wild and try that. once again, vastly different experience. i’m not a big fan of the ass fucking, and i don’t know of any man, if they’re truthful, really is. now, there’s women in the room who are thinking, “well, why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass?”  what a good question.  women, the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because… we know you fucking hate it.  so… i’m a father. um… i love my son! i love my son the same way that i love cigarettes. i like to hold him for five minutes every hour, and the rest of the time, i’m thinking about how he’s fucking killing me. he’s a good little boy. no, he’s a great little fella. i really like him. um… my girlfriend super loves him, though. it’s fucking creepy. and… i’m glad i have a son. that worked out good for me. i wouldn’t be a good father to a girl. it wouldn’t be good for me. nothing weird. wouldn’t fuck it. i… i just don’t get along with women. you know how it is. i don’t want them in my house, and… so… because you dream, see… for example, okay? when hank was born… the couple over the road, within two weeks of hank being born, had a baby girl, and rightly or wrongly, the first thing that went through my head was… “aw, that’s great. i hope hank fucks that one day.” that’s what i think… ‘cause that’s what i think about my son. i hope when he’s of age, he just fucks everything. i don’t care if my son is gay or straight. all i care about is, when he is of age, that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires. that is my dream for my son!  but never in the history of fathers and daughters, has a father held his baby girl and gone, “oh, i hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life. i hope you’re never shy of a cock. i hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up.” right, you know… and it’s not just me. women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well. my girlfriend goes to the gym every morning. i go there very occasionally, and when you go to the gym, there’s a little daycare crèche thing in the gym where you can hand your child off, and inside that daycare, there’s, like, three women in their 50s. they’re very nice ladies, and you hand your kid off and he plays. then when you finish your workout, you come and get him. and there’s a woman that works there who just loves my son. she sees all the other kids, but she loves hank, and hank fucking loves her, and the two of them light up when they see each other. and it’s super cute, i bring hank up the stairs, and he starts going, “uh, uh!” trying to reach at her, all right? and she does this, she goes, “everyone, my boyfriend’s here. here’s my boyfriend. give him here. he’s my boyfriend.” and then she kisses him, and she goes, ♪ my boyfriend gives me kisses my boyfriend gives me kisses ♪ it’s fucking adorable. but i tried doing that with a baby girl… let’s say you go to the gym and there’s a daycare, and me and a couple of my mates are working there. “hey, everyone… me girlfriend’s here. give her here. give her here. she’s my girlfriend. my girlfriend gives me kisses. you know that, right? she’s always giving me kisses. enjoy your workout. don’t worry about a thing.”   so… also… it’s just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter. it’s just little things. even when they’re babies, it’s just easier. there’s a wiping technique when you’re wiping a baby’s ass. i don’t know if you have children, but this is how you do it. the baby lays on its back. you put their feet together. you lift the feet up, and then you go in and wipe. with a boy, you can wipe like that. up and down, side to side, whatever the fuck you want, right? with a girl, you gotta wipe downward and away. downward and away. it’s very important that you wipe away from the cunt. very important. ‘cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts. they do. they fucking hate it. boys don’t give a shit. fucking… my son will have shit all over his dick and balls, and i’ll be cleaning it off under the foreskin, and he’ll be laughing like it’s the best day ever. even at my age now, i find it funny if i have shit on my dick. if i fuck my girlfriend in the ass, i pull out, i’ve got shit on my dick, i’ll ring me mate jason up and go, “hey, jason… it’s happened again. i got shit on my dick.” and he’ll tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick, and we’ll laugh and laugh and laugh. but never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and she’s thought, “oh, i can’t wait to call karen.”   when you… when my girlfriend got pregnant… when you meet… when you haven’t got a child, couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children. whenever you meet couples with children they’re always like, “it is the most fulfilling thing i’ve ever done with my life. my heart grows larger and larger every day.” and then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant, those same people went like this, “you’re never gonna sleep again!  forget about it. it’s over. you’re not gonna sleep.” they’re constantly telling you you’re not gonna sleep. raising a baby is not that hard. i’ll tell you what, it’s easier than a coke habit. i had a coke habit for seven-and-a-half fucking years! at least it’s not me who wakes up crying anymore! i can sleep through other people crying. i’ve had girlfriends. that’s like white noise to me. i find it soothing. see, me and my girlfriend, just two months, we went, “fuck it! let’s have a kid.” fucking did it, right? these other people, man… you know these couples, and they date from high school, and then they go out for a bit longer, and then after being together for like, seven years, they go, “we’re getting engaged. you wanna come to the party?” and you wanna say, “no, you’re really boring and we hate you.” but you go, “oh, okay, great. you’re still together, are you? you fucked one person, have you? oh, how exciting.” and… and then what they do is they don’t have a kid right away because they’re still not ready. “we have to see how our careers are going and shit.” and what they do is they get a dog, and then they act like the fucking dog’s their baby. they refer to it as their fucking baby. they send you a christmas card of them holding the dog… and it says, “from our family to yours.” and then you have a barbecue, and you invite them, the humans, right? then they come over. this fucking dog runs in, jumping over everything, and you’re like, “what the fuck is this shit?” and they’re like, “we had to bring him. we bring our baby everywhere.” and you go, “well, your baby is biting my actual baby. can you control…” and then, eventually, they decide they’re gonna have a kid ’cause they’ve learned so much from the dog, and then they bring the kid back, and the dog runs up, like, “what’s happening? a new person.” and they’re like, “fuck off. we don’t love you anymore. we’re going.” and they think they’ve learnt something from the dog, and they haven’t learnt anything. what happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the dog dies? you go off, you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog… try to pass it off as the same dog. what happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the baby dies? very hard… to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have. easier if you’re black or asian.  boston, no! no! no! shut up! i will not put up with racism at my shows, okay? i’m not saying ’cause they look the same. i’m saying ’cause they’re easier to purchase.   if angelina jolie and madonna have taught us anything… it is that you can buy black and asian people. i’m yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from norway with a child, going… “yolanda, quick, get hans. bring him over. come on.”  i’m gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit. uh… gun control. now… no, wait. before you… don’t get excited because the other people have guns. the anti-gun people are like, “yeah! do it, jim!” no, let’s just…  now, before i start saying this, i wanna say this, right? i believe in your right as americans to have guns. i’m not trying to stop you from having guns. all i’m saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion. my opinion on the… oh, it doesn’t matter. i don’t like guns, right? i’m gonna say some things that are just facts, right? in australia, we had guns, right? right up until 1996. in 1996, australia had the biggest massacre on earth. it still hasn’t been beaten. and… now, after that, they banned the guns. now, in the 10 years before port arthur, there was 10 massacres. since the gun ban in 1996, there hasn’t been a single massacre since. i don’t know how or why this happened, uh… maybe it was a coincidence, right? now, please understand that i understand that australia and america are two vastly different cultures with different people, right? i get it. in australia, we had the biggest massacre on earth, and the australian government went, “that’s it! no more guns!” and we all went, “yeah, all right, then. that seems fair enough, really.” now, in america, you had the sandy hook massacre where little, tiny children died, and your government went, “maybe… we’ll get rid of the big guns?” and 50% of you went, “fuck you! don’t take my guns!”  so, here’s where it gets confusing, right? now, as i said, i am all for your second amendment rights. i think you should be able to have guns. it’s in your constitution. what i am not for is bullshit arguments and lies. there is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun, and this is the argument… “fuck off. i like guns.” it’s not the best argument, but it’s all you’ve got. and there’s nothing wrong with it. there’s nothing wrong with saying, “i like something. don’t take it away from me.” but don’t give me this other bullshit. the main one is,  “i need it for protection. i need to protect me. i need to protect my family.” really? is that why they’re called “assault rifles”? is it? i’ve never heard of these fucking “protection rifles” you speak of. protection? what the fuck are you talking about? you have a gun in your house, you’re 80% more likely to use that gun on yourself, than to shoot someone else. and people think, “well, that’d never happen to me.” you don’t know that, because you know what?\n",

            "protection. i had a break-in in manchester, england, where i was tied up, i had my head cut. they threatened to rape my girlfriend. they came through the window with a machete and a hammer, and americans always go,  “well, imagine if you had a gun.” and i’m like, “all right. i was naked at the time. i wasn’t wearing my holster. i wasn’t staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through.” what world do you live in where you’re constantly fucking ready? you have guns ’cause you like guns! that’s why you go to gun conventions! that’s why you read gun magazines! none of you give a shit about home security. none of you go to home security conventions. none of you read padlock monthly. none of you have a facebook picture of you behind a secure door going, “fucking yeah!” like you’re going to be ready if someone comes into your house. you have it at all fucking times. by the way, most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking tv! you think that people are coming to murder your family? how many fucking enemies do you have? jeez, you think a lot of yourself if you think everyone’s coming to murder you. see, if you have it readily available, it becomes unsafe. you have it in your bedside table, one of your kids picks it up, thinks it’s a toy, shoots another one of your kids. happens every fucking day, but people go, “that’d never happen in my house ’cause i’m a responsible gun owner. i keep my guns locked in a safe.” then they’re no fucking protection! someone comes into the house, you’re like, “wait there, fuck-face! oh! you’ve come to the wrong house here, buddy boy. i tell you what. i’m gonna fuck you up! okay. is it 32 to the left or 32 to the right? your mother’s birthday? why the fuck would i know your fucking mother’s birthday? maybe if you didn’t leave the window open  ‘because it’s too hot in here,’ we wouldn’t be getting fucking murdered, right?” i find the nra to be hard work. the fact that they always think the answer is more guns. after sandy hook happened, the nra said, and i quote, “none of this would have happened if the teachers had guns.” i… i think they’re forgetting what school was like. does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to… whenever she came into school, that relief teacher came, you and your friends would see her and go,  “oh, we’re gonna make her cry.” and then she’d stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking, and you’d go, “you’re never getting married, are you, miss? never gonna happen for you.” then she’d get back to her 1967 volkswagen beetle, and she’d be crying over the steering wheel, just, “why don’t they like me?” let’s give that cunt a gun and see how things work out!  and then they go, “oh, well, answer to that, we’ll just add more guns.” they go, “we’ll put an armed security guard at every school across america.” yeah, that’ll work out. the average security guard in america earns $16 an hour. not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero! someone comes onto the school and…  and you’ve got kevin. now, i’m sure kevin’s shit-hot at call of duty, but it might not fucking cut it, ladies and gentlemen. now, i understand that when i’m doing this joke in this room, 50% of you agree with me, 50% of you don’t agree with me, and i do respect the people who don’t agree with me. don’t think i don’t. out of the 50% that don’t agree with me, 20% of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and it’s not to be taken seriously, and they’re laughing along ’cause it’s just funny jokes, right? and then the next 20%, have sort of phased out a little bit. they’re looking around, going, “wonder how they got that chandelier up there?” and then… there’s the last 10%. and they’re fucking furious. right now, in this room and the people watching at home… 10% of you are fucking seething. just… and for a couple of reasons. first reason, i’m making good points.  second reason. second reason. second reason, and this is the big one, i’m foreign… and that’s pissing the fuck out of you right now, and your brain is on a loop and you can’t fucking turn it off, and it’s just going around in a circle, and you’re just going, “if you don’t like it, go home! if you don’t like it, go home!” and my answer to that is, “no.” i came here legally. i pay my taxes. i’ll say whatever the fuck i want. your first amendment means that i can say the second amendment sucks dicks. and… unless you’re an american indian, you’re a fucking immigrant as well, so fuck off. people get so precious about it. i understand that to americans, your constitution is very important. i respect it, but please understand that every country has one as well. it’s no more special than any other constitution. we have one in australia. i don’t know what it says. i’ve never seen it. if there’s a problem, we’ll check it, but everything’s going fine. and don’t get me wrong. i get that the constitution is important to you. i have had… fucking, i get it, right? i’ve had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as i’m leaving the theater, going,  “you cannot change the second amendment!” and i’m like, “yes, you can. it’s called an ‘amendment.'” if you can’t change something that’s called an “amendment”, see, many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution. and if you don’t know what a thesaurus is, get a dictionary and work your way forward. don’t think your constitution is set in stone. you’ve changed things before. you used to have prohibition in there, right? and then people were like, “hey, who likes getting fucked up? yeah, i like getting fucked up, too. let’s get that one out. let’s get that one out.” you used to have this other thing in america called, uh… slavery! and then lincoln came along and went, “that’s it. no more slaves!” and 50% of you went, “fuck you! don’t take my slaves!” and the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns. “why should i have my slaves taken off me? i’m a responsible slave owner. i’m trained in how to use my slaves safely. just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesn’t mean that my rights should be taken away from me. i… i use my slaves to protect my family! i keep my slaves locked in a safe!” that’s the thing. “why should i have my guns taken off me? i’ve done nothing wrong.” look, i agree with you. if you’re a responsible gun owner and you don’t fuck around with them, then you should be allowed your guns. you really should. but that’s not how society works. we have to play to the 1% that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us. we have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving, right? i take drugs like a fucking champion, right?  we should all be allowed to take fucking drugs, but we can’t, can we? because sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids. oh! “oh, thanks, sarah. you fucked it up for everyone.” right? everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it, right? but we can’t because jonathan got drunk and ran over a family. “thanks, jonathan! now i have to drive at 30, you fucking idiot!” see, that’s the thing. “why should i have my guns taken off me, i’m responsible, just because that guy’s crazy?” who’s to say you’re not crazy? that’s the thing about crazy people. they don’t know they’re crazy. that’s what makes them crazy. the only thing you know for sure on this earth is, “i think, therefore i am.” you know that you exist. anything past that is open to interpretation, right? you know you exist and that’s it. right now, i think i’m in boston talking to 1,200 people. that’s what i think i’m doing, but there is a good to fair chance that i’m in a mental home, standing in front of a white wall, going,  “i hate guns. i hate guns. i hate guns.”  see, one of the better arguments is, “well, if you take the guns away, then only the criminals will have guns.” not true. when they banned the guns in australia, it worked. when they banned them in britain, it worked, okay? the bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in sandy hook costs, like, $1,000 american and you can buy it in walmart. it’ll be delivered to your house. that’s it, man. 1,000 bucks, right? that same gun in australia on the black market costs $34,000. now if you have $34,000, you don’t need to be a criminal. you’ve got $34,000. you’re a great little saver. keep going. so that covers the criminals, but that doesn’t cover the people who wanna murder your family, that are coming after you and your family. it kind of does. the people who do the massacres, it covers them ’cause they go… the kid at colorado who thought he was the joker, let’s say that he had some social issues. the kid at sandy hook was asperger’s as fuck. right? i don’t know if you know a lot about the black market, but you can’t just rock up at the docks going,  “guns! who wants to sell me a gun?” now, i’m gonna wrap this up. we won’t talk about it anymore. now… see, the one thing that i do really agree with with the right to bear arms, i really agree with… that the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government. in case the government became a bunch of cunts, you could all get your guns and fight back, and that’s why it was written. –  – yeah! and that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets. but you do know the government has drones, right? you get that? you’re bringing guns to a drone fight! if we went back to muskets, i’m all for it! keep the second amendment. if we all have muskets… muskets are awesome! every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times. you know what’s good about the musket? it gives you a lot of time to calm down. someone calls your wife fat, and you’re like, “fuck you, buddy! ah, you’re not a bad guy. you’re all right.” now… after the show, we’re gonna go out, have a big party around boston, see how it goes. i’m not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore. my girlfriend has said that’s a no… ’cause i don’t behave myself in there, so i’m not allowed to go to them anymore. ‘cause strip clubs aren’t what women think they are.  it used to be like… okay, so, when a man goes to a strip club, it’s all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible. that’s what men want to see. women, when they go to their magic mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are… women wanna see a guy, “hey, ladies. he’s a fireman.” and he comes out with his hose and like that… and whenever a stripper takes their clothes off, they’ve still got the fireman’s hat on or a tool belt on or policeman’s gun on a holster, right? because even when a man’s naked, a woman wants to know that he has a job. when men watch strippers, we want them to have a job, and that job’s stripping. we want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money, and just go… “you can’t take care of your kids.” it’s… and when men get private dances in these strip clubs, i don’t know… i don’t know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms, but basically, it’s dry humping. there’s no dancing. the girl gets in front. she gets where your cock is, pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it… and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face, and you go… that’s what a private “dance” is, right? i don’t know if there’s private dancing in female strip clubs.  i can’t imagine that there would be. i don’t imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going… she goes, “how was it?” and she goes, “well… he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals… and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead. i got to go to the atm.” so legit got canceled.  yeah. i know. i know it. who would’ve thought it would’ve struggled on that great fxx channel that everyone knew about? the first season is on netflix. this special is being recorded for netflix. so you can go watch it there if you’re watching the special. it was… i’m very proud of it. we had two great seasons of really good television, and if people didn’t… now… the whole tv show is based around one standup routine that i used to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that i took to a brothel, which is a true story. and so, when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who… in the end, we used dj qualls, and dj qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie road trip. he’s the skinny white guy out of the movie hustle & flow, and he’s the white guy out of the movie hustle & flow. now… the great thing about dj is… he already looks disabled. he has that “latter stages of aids” thing going on. it’s great for casting. anyway, but… i didn’t want dj to begin with. i wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic, and the actors’ union of america said, “you cannot do that.” because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy, i think, are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired. and i said, “all right, what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer?” and they sent me a list. and on this list, i said, “can you get rid of all the contagious ones? and what have we got left?” so i saw every disabled actor in hollywood, and i’ll be honest with you, not that many of them. i don’t know why. maybe they’re just lazy. they don’t wanna work. maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly. and none of them were very good, either. everyone we saw, none of them were very good ’cause acting is all about what you do with your hands. none of them knew what to do with their hands, and… they all came in. until this one guy came in. i had seen a lot of people that day. this guy was the most disabled person i’d ever seen in my life. he was like… think of the most disabled person you’ve seen, then double it. …really super disabled. he was shaped like a pretzel. he was being carried in by this big russian nurse, carried him in. he made that great disabled sound of…  that one. i just loved him. anyway… so he comes in for the audition… and i’m sitting there, and we’re doing the lines together, and at first, i didn’t know if he was mentally all there either, so i was being a little bit patronizing. i was going, “thank you so much for coming in.” and then we did the dialog together, and i didn’t have to worry about a thing. this kid was funny. he was smart. his timing was impeccable. i thought he was just great, and i helped him out of the room, and i come back to the director and i said, “that’s our guy. that’s who we gotta pick.” and he agreed, but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room. so the next bloke wheels himself in. now, obviously, he’s just a paraplegic if he’s wheeling himself in, which means the waist down, and that didn’t really suit me because… paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance. but i thought… “if he’s a good enough actor, maybe he can quad-up for the role.” so he comes in… he comes in, i shake his hand, and his leg slightly comes out at the same time. and i went, “whoa! what’s going on there, kicky?” and he goes… “oh, you got me! i’m not disabled.” and i said, “you’re fucking what now?” and he goes, “i’m not disabled. i just really wanted the role, so i rented a wheelchair.” and i said, “just shut up. so let me… this is how your day has mapped-out thus far. you woke up this morning. you drove to the wheelchair rental place. you rented a wheelchair. you carried it out, i assume. you put it in the trunk of your car. you drove here. you got the wheelchair out. you carried it up three flights of stairs. you went to the waiting room. you put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse. then you sat in it and practiced your lines.” and he went… “yeah.” and i said, “you’re a fucking asshole, mate. get the fuck out of here.” and i kicked him out. and later on that day, i’m sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors i’m gonna call to tell them they’ve got parts, and i’m holding this disabled guy’s headshot, and i just think, “i’m gonna call this guy up. i’m gonna change his life. this is an awesome moment, right?” and i’m looking at it, and he looks super handsome in his headshot. he looked really like… and i thought, “this has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history.” the shutter on his camera has gotta be like…  like…  and then i read the guy’s biography… and then it dawned on me. “this guy’s not disabled either! i hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair! this cunt rented a nurse!” do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse? i’m all for a method actor. get into character three hours before, but once you finish the audition, stand up and go, “ta-da!” and we would have gone, “that was very good.” but i’ll tell you what you don’t do. don’t make me carry you to your car! i carried him down three flights of stairs going, “you did very good.” he’s like, “thank you, jim.”   i was, uh… i go to a therapist… ’cause i get depressed. so i got a therapist every now and again. i literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like, “i’m gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind.” like just out of the movies, right? and she went, “red,” and i went, “blue.” and then she went, “cooking,” and i went, “food,” and all that type of stuff. we went like this forever. and then she went… for the last question, she went, “and what’s your favorite thing in the world?” and i went… “coming on a girl’s face.” now… now, i could’ve said things like… “ice cream” is a good answer. “hank” would’ve been an excellent answer. but i said, “coming on a girl’s face.” and i’ve had six months to think about my answer, and i stand by it. – i… –  i’m not proud of it. i hate myself for thinking it. it’s such a horrible thing to do to another human. when a girl’s on her knees and you… it’s so… and as an atheist, i believe in darwin and all the things that he wrote, but he never had a bit where he explained that. there was never a bit in his book where he went, “when a caveman loves a cavewoman, he’ll ejaculate on her face so that flies won’t come near.” there was never that… never that moment. but, by golly, if it’s not fun. i find it… to… look, to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time, may i say, “bravo!” don’t… don’t think what you do… has gone unnoticed. we notice. we appreciate your work. i think you deserve a parade of some kind. during memorial day, after the vietnam vets, before the first gulf war guys, we could bring in, “and here’s the women who take a load on their face.” and you could march out, and married men would stand there going, “god bless you, ladies.”  i enjoy your acting that you do. the standard tongue out and the… like that… i don’t know why, but i enjoy… i know it’s a lie. i know you’re not excited, but i still appreciate the effort is what i enjoy. i love the look because it’s such a, “oh, jeez, i’m excited, too. when this come hits my face, there’s a good chance i’ll also orgasm. anything could happen in this crazy world.” but this is what redeems us as men. this is what redeems us. just know that the second the come shoots out of our cock and hits your face, our bodies flood with remorse. the next 20 seconds is the nicest we will ever be to you.  i go from being an animal to the sweetest guy on earth. i’m like, “you fucking slut… oh, i love you. ah… uh, all right. no, no, no. put your tongue back in. um… keep your eyes shut. just keep them shut. uh… all right, i’m going to get a towel. i’ll get a towel. i’ll get you a towel. all right. you’re a wonderful mother to our child.”   see… this is what kills me. my son will one day watch this dvd. and i’m the guy who’s meant to teach him right from wrong, and i’m there wiping come off his mother’s face. i think i did something illegal with my son the other day. i think it might be illegal. tell me if this is illegal. all right? i’m in the shower. my girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning, and when she came back, i was in the shower, and hank ran up, and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like, “argh!” like that. and i went…  and i saw his little face and i went, “hello, hankie.” and then in the condensation, i drew a little bowtie on him… and a little suit… and then i gave him a voice bubble that said, “i love my daddy. love, hank.” but i did it so i could read it. well, of course he could read the “k,” and… then i stepped out. i stepped out of the bathroom and i went, “g’day, hankie!” and he slapped my cock and he ran off. now, is that illegal? i don’t know. is it illegal because, a, a child touched my cock, or because, b, i found it really funny and i’ve been telling everyone. and i can’t get angry at him because his whole life, he’s been lying on mats with things dangling over. he’s been training for this his entire life. i think i’ve, uh… i think i’ve become american, more american than i am australian lately, and there was a moment where i tipped over where i went, “oh, i think like an american person now.” and i’m happy to do it. i just… i’ll tell you what happened. i was flying around… i was doing a tour of australia, and i was flying domestically around australia, and i’m so used to airports and stuff here in america that… okay, what happens is, when you go… i was flying sydney to melbourne. when you fly domestically in australia, you go up to the machine, put your name in, prints your ticket out, it prints your bag thing, you put the bag thing on your bag yourself, and then there’s a conveyor belt underneath. you throw your bag on. bag fucks off. you don’t speak to anyone. then i go up to the gate bit, and the lady’s going, “tickets, please.” and i’m holding my id out like a fucking simpleton. ‘cause i get through airports quick, man. i’m like, “fucking there you go.” and she went, “put your id away. i don’t need to see that.” and i went… “i think you do.” and she went, “i don’t… why would i need to see your id?” and i said, “i might be a terrorist.” and she went, “would showing me your id stop you from blowing the plane up?” “no, i’d probably still blow the plane up.” so then i get up to the tsa conveyor belt thing, and i’m so good at the airports. i’m already taking my shoes off as i’m walking, right? and all the australians behind me assume that i’m american, and they’re losing their fucking shit. they’re like, “oh, for fuck’s sake! one of these cunts, eh?” and the tsa guy goes, “hey, mate, what are you taking your shoes off for?” and i went…  “i don’t know! maybe they’re bombs?” and he went… “but they’re not, are they?” i put me shoes back on. i get my laptop out. everyone’s going mental. and the tsa guy says, very politely, but extraordinarily sarcastically, he goes, “jeez, mate. that’s a nice computer. why are you showing it to everyone?” “it might also be a bomb.” and then the guy said the most australian thing i’ve ever heard come out of anyone’s mouth ever. he went… “oh, come on, mate. you wouldn’t have two bombs.”   i’m not even quite sure what that means, but it does make some type of sense. all right. oscar pistorius. if you haven’t been following the case, you’re missing out. this is the greatest thing since oj simpson. you’re fucking missing out, mate. if you don’t know who oscar pistorius is, let me fill you in. oscar pistorius is a legless man from south africa, known as the blade runner. he ran in two olympics, the disabled and the able-bodied olympics in one year. no one has ever done that. he’s an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and able-bodied people alike, and on valentine’s day last year, he shot and killed the hottest girl on earth… and that’s when he became an inspiration to me… ’cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long. let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there. you can’t just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want.  people have feelings, you cunts. now, there’s a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day. one of the theories is that they found in her phone… he went through her phone, and on her phone, he found some text messages from a south african rugby player on valentine’s day, right? now, i don’t know if you’ve ever been to south africa, but in south africa, rugby is more popular than legless running. it goes, rugby, legless running, cricket. legless running’s their second sport. you wouldn’t have thought that. anyway… i’m going to reenact what i believe happened that day. to do that, i will now be doing a south african accent. now i know, many of you can’t tell the difference between my accent and a south african accent. here’s the difference. picture my accent, but i’m punching a black person. what i’m trying to say is south africans are horrible people. so… she’s coming out of the shower. she’s been drying her hair. she’s listening to rodriguez or something. she comes out. he’s laying on the bed. he looks up at her, he’s holding the phone, and he goes,  “what the fuck is this? i’ve been through your phone. you have been texting a rugby player.” and she’s like, “oh! fuck you! who the fuck do you think you are?” “who am i? i’m oscar pistorius, the greatest legless runner that has ever been. that’s who the fuck i am.” “well, i would rather be with a rugby player. at least he is a whole man, not a three-quarter man like you.” –  – i know.  “oh! fuck you!” “no! fuck you! i’m leaving you!” and then she storms out of the room, and then he was like… “you fucking bitch!  i hate you!  you will rue the day… that you left oscar pistorius, the blade runner! don’t go anywhere!  i hate you!” that’s where he keeps his legs. all right. then he put the blades on. “oh, you’re in trouble, missy. i tell you. i go to my gun safe.” she locked herself in the bathroom. he shot her through the bathroom door. seems like overkill, doesn’t it? bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them, but oscar’s one of the few men on earth that couldn’t kick the door in, right? he was wearing the blades, so… boing! ah! so… i think oscar will probably go to prison. now… in south africa, one in four people have aids. i assume it may even be worse in the prison population. now, can i say this? look… i’ve never raped a man. i hate that i have to put “a man” in that sentence, but whatever. i’ve never raped a man, but… if i was going to rape a man, it would be a legless olympian… ’cause in prison, it’s all about getting one up on other people, and making people think you’re tough and all that. like, “you want to fucking rape me? i just raped an olympian, bitch. is that what you fucking want?” there’d be a wonderful moment… when you’re in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a terminator movie.  you know what i like about that joke? so often when you tell a joke, the rapist is the villain in the story, but not in that one. not in that one. he’s the hero. all right, we have to get going soon. before i leave, – i thank you very much for coming. –  no, i said, “soon,” not “over.” it’s just soon, you cunts, so calm down.   i always… i always find that weird when someone, like, whistles like that. what do they think is going to happen? like, i’m going to go, “fucking you know me, mate. i was enjoying claps and cheers, but what i needed was a high-pitched squeal noise. thank god you came along to pick up my spirits.”  love you! all right, final story. now, i was in south africa again. jeez, i don’t think i’ll be working in south africa after this special comes out. i used to do, like, one tour in south africa every year, and i just don’t know if i’ll be invited this time. they’ll be like,  “we don’t like him. he’s no good.” anyway, so, i’m in south africa, and i had to fly back from cape town to los angeles, which is, like, a 26-hour flight. you’ve to go up to london and go across. cunt of a trip. um… but it was all right ’cause i had a business class ticket, so i didn’t give a fuck. and when i travel economy, i try to dress up nice ’cause i like to look good in case someone recognizes me and i might get an upgrade. but when i’ve already got a business class ticket, i try to look like a bag of shit… ’cause it’s important to me that everyone else in business class doesn’t want me there and they’re annoyed by my presence. so… i’m wearing a white t-shirt that’s got brown stains on it with a hole in the side. i’m wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out. so, anyway, i go up to the counter, up to the business thing with the thing, and i go, “hello,” and the lady goes,  “oh, mr. jefferies, i’m so sorry, but you have been downgraded.” i said, “you what now?” she goes, “business class is full. you have been downgraded.” and i said, “i understand that business class is full. i bought one of the tickets that made it full.” and she went, “i’m sorry, sir. there’s nothing i can do.” and then i just went, “are you fucking kidding me?” now, you know when you’re dealing with customer service people, and they want you to swear, ’cause as soon as you swear, they don’t have to engage with you anymore. they can act like they’re the first adult never to hear a swear word, and they can get really offended, right? so i went, “are you fucking kidding me?” and she went, “please do not speak to me that way! i have done nothing wrong!” and i said, “are you, a white south african, telling me you’ve done nothing wrong?” anyway… tensions rose. the manager comes over. big fat cunt called simon fulcher, right? he walks over and goes,  “what is wrong here? what is wrong?” and i said, “i bought a business class ticket and i want a business class ticket.” and he goes, “what do you want me to do? make a new chair for you? there are no more seats. i can’t do anything.” he goes, “i’ll tell you what i can do. go up to the executive lounge. have some peanuts. enjoy a beverage. listen to rodriguez, and if something opens up, we will move you back up to business class. so i thought, “there’s nothing i can do.” so i walk off with my ticket. i’m walking through the airport like, “fucking british airways, bunch of fucking cunts.” right? i get up to the counter. and the woman behind the counter said, “tickets, please.” and i hand over my ticket and she goes,  “i’m sorry, sir, but this is for business class passengers only. your ticket says ‘economy’ on it.” and i said…  “i bought a business class ticket, but you people have downgraded…” and as i was doing my little speech, she looked past me and went, “next.”  “listen here, you fucking cunt.”  all right? now, you say “cunt” in any foreign country, people lose their fucking shit. security came from everywhere. i was going, “don’t you fucking come near me, cunt!” and i said, “i want to speak to simon fulcher,” like i’m… and they go, “all right.” they ring the manager up, and then they go… he goes, “is it the pale australian man?” and the guy went, “yes.” he goes, “we’ve had problems with him. let him through.” right? so i go through. i’m sitting there, i’m eating my peanuts. and i’m just angry now, going, “fucking british airways. fucking cunts, fucking…” like that. and in walks in a group of americans, about 30 of them. you know the type, right? they all… and whenever i see americans abroad… i’ll do my impersonation of any american abroad. when americans are abroad, you’re just pointing out shit you see. you’re just walking around going,  “oh, this is great! look at that. that’s a chair right there. okay. oh, what’s that over there? okay. wonderful. great.” right? and this group walked in, and one of the women in the group went like this, she went,  “did anyone else see that australian guy speaking to that lady out there? some people have no class.” and i put my head around the pylon, and i went, “you can fuck off and all! you don’t know what i’ve been through! i’ve been downgraded!” and as i said that, 18 other people who were given the same lie that i was given, that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class, the penny dropped. none of us are getting promoted. they all lied to us, and we formed an angry militia in seconds. it was like a scene out of braveheart, and they all stood up and went, “fucking downgraded!” and the woman in the group was doing this, “don’t speak to me that way. who the hell do you think you are?” and all the men in the group were like, “hey, why don’t you shut the fuck up? just shut the fuck up.” ♪ it doesn’t matter these people seem very angry, so ♪ and a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down. and, sometimes, americans, sometimes, you can seem a little insincere. and he came up and he went,  “hey. hey. yeah, i get it.  downgraded, yeah. that really grinds my gears, i tell you that. yeah, i would write a strongly-worded letter. i really would.” and then i thought, at least this guy’s being nice, and i said, “look, mate, don’t worry about it. it’s not like it’s your fault.” and i said, “why are you in such a big group anyway?” and he goes, “oh, we’re in neil diamond’s band. that’s neil diamond’s backup singer you just called a cunt there.” and as he said that, neil diamond walked around the corner like a fucking superhero… and i reacted like he was one. i went, “neil diamond!” and neil diamond went,  “hey, what’s going on?” and then, for a second there, there was a bit of my brain that thought maybe neil diamond could solve problems. and i went, “neil! me and all these people, we’ve been downgraded!” and neil went, “oh! oh, right. uh, well, maybe that’s our fault. we decided to come back a day early.” “you can fuck off and all, neil diamond!” and then a fight breaks out amongst the neil diamond band and the downgraded. punches are thrown. not by me. i don’t know if you have the internet, but i’m not much of a fighter. i’m an excellent scurrier-awayer. i get down. “hey, what have you got there? hiya!” anyway, the airport police came. three people were arrested from the downgraded… but three people were arrested from the neil diamond band, and that meant that three seats opened up in business class.  ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. good night. appreciate it.   thank you. go home. let’s have a drink. bye. your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * \n",

            "   ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage mr jim jefferies  hello sit down sit down sit down sit down sit down  thank you boston i appreciate that  uh that’s very sweet of you  love you i’m at the end of the tour right now i’m very happy to be on tour because i now have a child ah so… any time out of home is good for me um i got my girlfriend pregnant after knowing her for two months so…  thank you thank you life decisions and she’s a nice girl and i love her in a way sure my problem with my girlfriend is she’s very sweet but she’s shit at telling stories and i’m awesome at telling stories so it really bothers me when she talks and i don’t know if that’ll be a problem in the future but it’s a problem now and i don’t see it getting better um… i’ll give you an example right i was in the car and my son hank was asleep in the back seat and we’re driving along and on the radio comes madonna and my girlfriend just slips into conversation “oh i used to party with madonna” and i went “you fucking what when” and she went “i used to party with madonna” now i should fill you in a little bit on this my girlfriend used to be a model in miami right i’m not bragging i didn’t get the model years i didn’t get those years i’ve seen the photos very impressive um… so i said “so you used to party with madonna madonna used to have big parties and invite models over right” and she went “no no it would just be me and a few other people” i go “you need to elaborate on this story right now” and she goes “oh okay i used to date the center for the miami heat” as soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an nba center even if this guy’s even slightly in proportion… a lot of things flood through your head first thing is “that’s why your cunt’s so fucked up” that’s a big one “that’s why our child came out while you were walking i understand” so she said “i used to date the center for the miami heat his best friend was dennis rodman dennis rodman used to go out with madonna and we used to go over to madonna’s house” and she goes “this one time the four of us were over at madonna’s house and we were all fucked up on drugs and one thing led to another…” and then i went “shut the fuck up” and she went “what” i said “i know what ‘one thing led to another’ means you all started fucking each other” and she went “we did we started…” “just shut up” and she goes “what do you care for” i said “you’re the mother of my child i don’t wanna picture you being fucked by a 7’2″ nba player while you’re licking out madonna’s muscular vagina and dennis rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock going…”  and she goes “oh you’re being silly what do you care for you’ve partied way more than i have in my life” and i went “that is not true i’ve gotten wasted way more than you have but i have in no way partied way more than you have often i get wasted just by myself i wouldn’t call it a party” for most of my career i was a struggling comedian right and this is how struggling comedians party right it’s 500 am monday right we’re in a onebedroom apartment seven of us are standing around a coffee table trying to stretch out two grams of coke one of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories… and the rest of us are talking about where women might be one of us has come up with a plan the plan goes like this “well… nurses will be finishing their shift soon maybe if we just stand out the front of the er they’ll appreciate seven funny guys”  i don’t… you know i’ve never partied like a model i have partied twice in my life twice like really partied i’ve had good nights out but i’ve really partied twice if you really party and most people never experience this it’s an amazing thing it happens in vegas it can only happen in vegas and it’s gotta involve celebrity right i’m not famous but the people around me were super famous and i was at this party in the night club and they took me in and then there’s the night club but then there’s the real night club out the back which is like the size of this stage it’s only a little room and you go back there and you can just… they encourage you to take drugs in the open and you’re just doing it off a key  and they’re going “no dude use the table don’t use your…” and i go “oh oh oh sorry um…” and it’s confusing at first and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room just bring ’em in like “huh” and you can do this you can go… “uh…” like that and they’ll drag these women away it is the best thing you’ll ever do with your life when you party that hard as a man there’s a lot of remorse ’cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money you wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover and you go to your friends you go “oh my god we partied so hard last night i spent 5000” when a hot girl parties that hard she wakes up in the morning and goes “oh my god we partied so hard last night i made 5000” and that’s a vastly different emotion that… i don’t think women will never… yeah okay this is the thing in america at the moment they’re trying to raise the minimum wage to i don’t know 16 an hour or something like that and whenever they bring up this argument they always go “and still to this day women only earn 70 of what men earn in the workplace” and of course that’s disgusting how dare women earn so much like… a lot of things that i say tonight will be jokes that i don’t actually mean but this is something i’m really passionate about women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace i’m sorry i…  i’m not being a misogynistic bastard right i’m not saying that women don’t work as hard i’m sure they do i’m not saying they don’t do as good a job what i’m saying is they don’t deserve to earn as much money as men right men need that extra 30 to buy meals and drinks and jim jefferies tickets and all that shit  now… i’m sure there’s women in this room that are saying “oh i pay for my drinks i bought my own ticket” and don’t think we don’t appreciate the uglies ’cause we do right we do but there’s little things in society that you can’t change men have extra expenses that you’ll never understand there’s holidays that are just for women like valentine’s day is just for women they say it’s for romantics they say it’s for couples or something like that it’s just for women there’s no man who gets excited by valentine’s day there’s no man that when he sees the valentine’s day decorations go up in the shopping mall he goes “oh valentine’s day is coming” valentine’s day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head and it goes like this “how much money do i have to spend today so that you won’t act like a cunt” it doesn’t stop there mother’s day mother’s day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old my girlfriend’s first mother’s day and she went “oh i wonder what i’ll get for mother’s day” and i went “probably fucking nothing he’s got no money he’s six months old what do you think he’s gonna buy you” within an hour her friends were over at the house just by coincidence telling me what a bad person i was and how important mother’s day is to a new mum you know and so i went and bought her a cappuccino machine ’cause i assumed that’s what hank would have wanted her to have… and i wrote a card i’m not a bastard i wrote a card i’m righthanded so i got my left hand every new dad knows this you get the crayon and you go  “happy mother’s day love hank” and i went “han…” and then i did the “k” backtofront because he’s a fucking moron see now i know there’s people in the room they’re thinking “well fathers have father’s day” father’s day is bullshit it’s fucking shit father’s day father’s day came around and my girlfriend went “what do you want for father’s day” and i went “i don’t want anything don’t even worry about it i don’t want anything” and she goes “come on you gotta have something” i said “honestly i don’t want anything” and she goes “come on” and i went “it’s my fucking money just don’t touch it just leave my money alone how hard is this how about for 24 hours you don’t touch my fucking money that would be a gift” that’s why every single father has that one father’s day gift that they cherish and it’s shit it’s like a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handle’s too big and it says “i heart dad” and they keep that for 20 fucking years this mug and do you wanna know why they like it every now and again they look at it and go… “that cost me nothing that mug”  see… wouldn’t it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff but didn’t cost anything that everyone could participate in right i’ve got it right april 18th… anal sex day  it’s good isn’t it everyone’s girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on april 18th it’s nice a month before you’d be walking around the shopping center going “oh the decorations are up”  and it’s good ’cause if your bird didn’t take it in the ass you could do the same thing that women do on valentine’s day when they don’t get a gift you could go like “oh me mate jason his wife took it in the ass twice yeah obviously they’re more connected than we are they’ve uh…” i’m thinking i don’t do much merchandise after my shows and stuff but i’m thinking of bringing out some april 18th tshirts not even putting “jim jefferies” on them or anything just tshirts that say “april 18th” ‘cause it’s good right you’re in a bar you’re a guy you see a guy at the other end of the bar with an april 18th and you go… fucking friends for life right but even better you see a girl with an april 18th tshirt the weird thing is i’m biggingup anal sex here and i don’t even really like fucking girls in the ass that much i’m not even a huge fan i much prefer the cunt i think it’s a much more… i think that a cunt is a much more purposebuilt thing to fuck but you know anal sex… oh you know… i do it i get involved ’cause i feel like i have to you know i… but i’ve never been a big fan of the ass fucking i uh… when i watch it on porn it seems very inviting the girl’s taking it so fluently in her ass and she seems to be having fun and uh… but the thing is you can’t smell porn you don’t smell porn you just… you just watch it they never… and it’s different porn it’s different they clean the girl’s asshole they pump water into it until it’s very hygienic i’m sure and the girl seems to be so happy she’s like… you’ve got it in her pussy you’re fucking her and then she’s like “put it in my ass” she’s inviting it’s like you’re doing her a favor in porn and then she’s like… she says things… i don’t know things like “i’m enjoying that keep putting it in my ass fuck my ass i love a cock in my ass” and… and the experience i’ve had in my own life has been vastly different i’ve… my experience has been a lot of crying now although that can help you come at times it’s not what you want… it’s not what you want for every day i like the girl who acts like she’s enjoying it like you know when your girlfriend’s like “i’m gonna act like i enjoy it” she does that whole “yeah oh no that’s good”  ahh ♪ i’m having a good time ♪ and then they’re always going “are you done are you close to done” you never fuck a pussy and they go “are you almost done finish this” like that if you’re fucking ass they don’t want you… they want it all over quick and they do other things the porn girls i don’t know how much they get paid i’m sure it’s more than what the men get paid it’s the opposite bit of society um… but they do a thing called “atm” i don’t know if you know what that is kids that stands for “ass to mouth” that’s where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus and she’ll put it directly in her mouth and she’ll say something like “i love the taste of my ass let me taste my ass” and then the man as a favor to this woman puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work…  she’s been doing now i had a drunken night with my exgirlfriend where she thought she’d be all wild and try that once again vastly different experience i’m not a big fan of the ass fucking and i don’t know of any man if they’re truthful really is now there’s women in the room who are thinking “well why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass”  what a good question  women the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because… we know you fucking hate it  so… i’m a father um… i love my son i love my son the same way that i love cigarettes i like to hold him for five minutes every hour and the rest of the time i’m thinking about how he’s fucking killing me he’s a good little boy no he’s a great little fella i really like him um… my girlfriend super loves him though it’s fucking creepy and… i’m glad i have a son that worked out good for me i wouldn’t be a good father to a girl it wouldn’t be good for me nothing weird wouldn’t fuck it i… i just don’t get along with women you know how it is i don’t want them in my house and… so… because you dream see… for example okay when hank was born… the couple over the road within two weeks of hank being born had a baby girl and rightly or wrongly the first thing that went through my head was… “aw that’s great i hope hank fucks that one day” that’s what i think… ‘cause that’s what i think about my son i hope when he’s of age he just fucks everything i don’t care if my son is gay or straight all i care about is when he is of age that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires that is my dream for my son  but never in the history of fathers and daughters has a father held his baby girl and gone “oh i hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life i hope you’re never shy of a cock i hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up” right you know… and it’s not just me women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well my girlfriend goes to the gym every morning i go there very occasionally and when you go to the gym there’s a little daycare crèche thing in the gym where you can hand your child off and inside that daycare there’s like three women in their 50s they’re very nice ladies and you hand your kid off and he plays then when you finish your workout you come and get him and there’s a woman that works there who just loves my son she sees all the other kids but she loves hank and hank fucking loves her and the two of them light up when they see each other and it’s super cute i bring hank up the stairs and he starts going “uh uh” trying to reach at her all right and she does this she goes “everyone my boyfriend’s here here’s my boyfriend give him here he’s my boyfriend” and then she kisses him and she goes ♪ my boyfriend gives me kisses my boyfriend gives me kisses ♪ it’s fucking adorable but i tried doing that with a baby girl… let’s say you go to the gym and there’s a daycare and me and a couple of my mates are working there “hey everyone… me girlfriend’s here give her here give her here she’s my girlfriend my girlfriend gives me kisses you know that right she’s always giving me kisses enjoy your workout don’t worry about a thing”   so… also… it’s just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter it’s just little things even when they’re babies it’s just easier there’s a wiping technique when you’re wiping a baby’s ass i don’t know if you have children but this is how you do it the baby lays on its back you put their feet together you lift the feet up and then you go in and wipe with a boy you can wipe like that up and down side to side whatever the fuck you want right with a girl you gotta wipe downward and away downward and away it’s very important that you wipe away from the cunt very important ‘cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts they do they fucking hate it boys don’t give a shit fucking… my son will have shit all over his dick and balls and i’ll be cleaning it off under the foreskin and he’ll be laughing like it’s the best day ever even at my age now i find it funny if i have shit on my dick if i fuck my girlfriend in the ass i pull out i’ve got shit on my dick i’ll ring me mate jason up and go “hey jason… it’s happened again i got shit on my dick” and he’ll tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick and we’ll laugh and laugh and laugh but never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and she’s thought “oh i can’t wait to call karen”   when you… when my girlfriend got pregnant… when you meet… when you haven’t got a child couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children whenever you meet couples with children they’re always like “it is the most fulfilling thing i’ve ever done with my life my heart grows larger and larger every day” and then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant those same people went like this “you’re never gonna sleep again  forget about it it’s over you’re not gonna sleep” they’re constantly telling you you’re not gonna sleep raising a baby is not that hard i’ll tell you what it’s easier than a coke habit i had a coke habit for sevenandahalf fucking years at least it’s not me who wakes up crying anymore i can sleep through other people crying i’ve had girlfriends that’s like white noise to me i find it soothing see me and my girlfriend just two months we went “fuck it let’s have a kid” fucking did it right these other people man… you know these couples and they date from high school and then they go out for a bit longer and then after being together for like seven years they go “we’re getting engaged you wanna come to the party” and you wanna say “no you’re really boring and we hate you” but you go “oh okay great you’re still together are you you fucked one person have you oh how exciting” and… and then what they do is they don’t have a kid right away because they’re still not ready “we have to see how our careers are going and shit” and what they do is they get a dog and then they act like the fucking dog’s their baby they refer to it as their fucking baby they send you a christmas card of them holding the dog… and it says “from our family to yours” and then you have a barbecue and you invite them the humans right then they come over this fucking dog runs in jumping over everything and you’re like “what the fuck is this shit” and they’re like “we had to bring him we bring our baby everywhere” and you go “well your baby is biting my actual baby can you control…” and then eventually they decide they’re gonna have a kid ’cause they’ve learned so much from the dog and then they bring the kid back and the dog runs up like “what’s happening a new person” and they’re like “fuck off we don’t love you anymore we’re going” and they think they’ve learnt something from the dog and they haven’t learnt anything what happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the dog dies you go off you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog… try to pass it off as the same dog what happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the baby dies very hard… to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have easier if you’re black or asian  boston no no no shut up i will not put up with racism at my shows okay i’m not saying ’cause they look the same i’m saying ’cause they’re easier to purchase   if angelina jolie and madonna have taught us anything… it is that you can buy black and asian people i’m yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from norway with a child going… “yolanda quick get hans bring him over come on”  i’m gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit uh… gun control now… no wait before you… don’t get excited because the other people have guns the antigun people are like “yeah do it jim” no let’s just…  now before i start saying this i wanna say this right i believe in your right as americans to have guns i’m not trying to stop you from having guns all i’m saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion my opinion on the… oh it doesn’t matter i don’t like guns right i’m gonna say some things that are just facts right in australia we had guns right right up until 1996 in 1996 australia had the biggest massacre on earth it still hasn’t been beaten and… now after that they banned the guns now in the 10 years before port arthur there was 10 massacres since the gun ban in 1996 there hasn’t been a single massacre since i don’t know how or why this happened uh… maybe it was a coincidence right now please understand that i understand that australia and america are two vastly different cultures with different people right i get it in australia we had the biggest massacre on earth and the australian government went “that’s it no more guns” and we all went “yeah all right then that seems fair enough really” now in america you had the sandy hook massacre where little tiny children died and your government went “maybe… we’ll get rid of the big guns” and 50 of you went “fuck you don’t take my guns”  so here’s where it gets confusing right now as i said i am all for your second amendment rights i think you should be able to have guns it’s in your constitution what i am not for is bullshit arguments and lies there is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun and this is the argument… “fuck off i like guns” it’s not the best argument but it’s all you’ve got and there’s nothing wrong with it there’s nothing wrong with saying “i like something don’t take it away from me” but don’t give me this other bullshit the main one is  “i need it for protection i need to protect me i need to protect my family” really is that why they’re called “assault rifles” is it i’ve never heard of these fucking “protection rifles” you speak of protection what the fuck are you talking about you have a gun in your house you’re 80 more likely to use that gun on yourself than to shoot someone else and people think “well that’d never happen to me” you don’t know that because you know what\n",

            "♪ and then uhoh ♪\n",
            "protection i had a breakin in manchester england where i was tied up i had my head cut they threatened to rape my girlfriend they came through the window with a machete and a hammer and americans always go  “well imagine if you had a gun” and i’m like “all right i was naked at the time i wasn’t wearing my holster i wasn’t staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through” what world do you live in where you’re constantly fucking ready you have guns ’cause you like guns that’s why you go to gun conventions that’s why you read gun magazines none of you give a shit about home security none of you go to home security conventions none of you read padlock monthly none of you have a facebook picture of you behind a secure door going “fucking yeah” like you’re going to be ready if someone comes into your house you have it at all fucking times by the way most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking tv you think that people are coming to murder your family how many fucking enemies do you have jeez you think a lot of yourself if you think everyone’s coming to murder you see if you have it readily available it becomes unsafe you have it in your bedside table one of your kids picks it up thinks it’s a toy shoots another one of your kids happens every fucking day but people go “that’d never happen in my house ’cause i’m a responsible gun owner i keep my guns locked in a safe” then they’re no fucking protection someone comes into the house you’re like “wait there fuckface oh you’ve come to the wrong house here buddy boy i tell you what i’m gonna fuck you up okay is it 32 to the left or 32 to the right your mother’s birthday why the fuck would i know your fucking mother’s birthday maybe if you didn’t leave the window open  ‘because it’s too hot in here’ we wouldn’t be getting fucking murdered right” i find the nra to be hard work the fact that they always think the answer is more guns after sandy hook happened the nra said and i quote “none of this would have happened if the teachers had guns” i… i think they’re forgetting what school was like does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to… whenever she came into school that relief teacher came you and your friends would see her and go  “oh we’re gonna make her cry” and then she’d stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking and you’d go “you’re never getting married are you miss never gonna happen for you” then she’d get back to her 1967 volkswagen beetle and she’d be crying over the steering wheel just “why don’t they like me” let’s give that cunt a gun and see how things work out  and then they go “oh well answer to that we’ll just add more guns” they go “we’ll put an armed security guard at every school across america” yeah that’ll work out the average security guard in america earns 16 an hour not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero someone comes onto the school and…  and you’ve got kevin now i’m sure kevin’s shithot at call of duty but it might not fucking cut it ladies and gentlemen now i understand that when i’m doing this joke in this room 50 of you agree with me 50 of you don’t agree with me and i do respect the people who don’t agree with me don’t think i don’t out of the 50 that don’t agree with me 20 of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and it’s not to be taken seriously and they’re laughing along ’cause it’s just funny jokes right and then the next 20 have sort of phased out a little bit they’re looking around going “wonder how they got that chandelier up there” and then… there’s the last 10 and they’re fucking furious right now in this room and the people watching at home… 10 of you are fucking seething just… and for a couple of reasons first reason i’m making good points  second reason second reason second reason and this is the big one i’m foreign… and that’s pissing the fuck out of you right now and your brain is on a loop and you can’t fucking turn it off and it’s just going around in a circle and you’re just going “if you don’t like it go home if you don’t like it go home” and my answer to that is “no” i came here legally i pay my taxes i’ll say whatever the fuck i want your first amendment means that i can say the second amendment sucks dicks and… unless you’re an american indian you’re a fucking immigrant as well so fuck off people get so precious about it i understand that to americans your constitution is very important i respect it but please understand that every country has one as well it’s no more special than any other constitution we have one in australia i don’t know what it says i’ve never seen it if there’s a problem we’ll check it but everything’s going fine and don’t get me wrong i get that the constitution is important to you i have had… fucking i get it right i’ve had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as i’m leaving the theater going  “you cannot change the second amendment” and i’m like “yes you can it’s called an ‘amendment” if you can’t change something that’s called an “amendment” see many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution and if you don’t know what a thesaurus is get a dictionary and work your way forward don’t think your constitution is set in stone you’ve changed things before you used to have prohibition in there right and then people were like “hey who likes getting fucked up yeah i like getting fucked up too let’s get that one out let’s get that one out” you used to have this other thing in america called uh… slavery and then lincoln came along and went “that’s it no more slaves” and 50 of you went “fuck you don’t take my slaves” and the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns “why should i have my slaves taken off me i’m a responsible slave owner i’m trained in how to use my slaves safely just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesn’t mean that my rights should be taken away from me i… i use my slaves to protect my family i keep my slaves locked in a safe” that’s the thing “why should i have my guns taken off me i’ve done nothing wrong” look i agree with you if you’re a responsible gun owner and you don’t fuck around with them then you should be allowed your guns you really should but that’s not how society works we have to play to the 1 that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us we have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving right i take drugs like a fucking champion right  we should all be allowed to take fucking drugs but we can’t can we because sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids oh “oh thanks sarah you fucked it up for everyone” right everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it right but we can’t because jonathan got drunk and ran over a family “thanks jonathan now i have to drive at 30 you fucking idiot” see that’s the thing “why should i have my guns taken off me i’m responsible just because that guy’s crazy” who’s to say you’re not crazy that’s the thing about crazy people they don’t know they’re crazy that’s what makes them crazy the only thing you know for sure on this earth is “i think therefore i am” you know that you exist anything past that is open to interpretation right you know you exist and that’s it right now i think i’m in boston talking to 1200 people that’s what i think i’m doing but there is a good to fair chance that i’m in a mental home standing in front of a white wall going  “i hate guns i hate guns i hate guns”  see one of the better arguments is “well if you take the guns away then only the criminals will have guns” not true when they banned the guns in australia it worked when they banned them in britain it worked okay the bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in sandy hook costs like 1000 american and you can buy it in walmart it’ll be delivered to your house that’s it man 1000 bucks right that same gun in australia on the black market costs 34000 now if you have 34000 you don’t need to be a criminal you’ve got 34000 you’re a great little saver keep going so that covers the criminals but that doesn’t cover the people who wanna murder your family that are coming after you and your family it kind of does the people who do the massacres it covers them ’cause they go… the kid at colorado who thought he was the joker let’s say that he had some social issues the kid at sandy hook was asperger’s as fuck right i don’t know if you know a lot about the black market but you can’t just rock up at the docks going  “guns who wants to sell me a gun” now i’m gonna wrap this up we won’t talk about it anymore now… see the one thing that i do really agree with with the right to bear arms i really agree with… that the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government in case the government became a bunch of cunts you could all get your guns and fight back and that’s why it was written –  – yeah and that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets but you do know the government has drones right you get that you’re bringing guns to a drone fight if we went back to muskets i’m all for it keep the second amendment if we all have muskets… muskets are awesome every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times you know what’s good about the musket it gives you a lot of time to calm down someone calls your wife fat and you’re like “fuck you buddy ah you’re not a bad guy you’re all right” now… after the show we’re gonna go out have a big party around boston see how it goes i’m not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore my girlfriend has said that’s a no… ’cause i don’t behave myself in there so i’m not allowed to go to them anymore ‘cause strip clubs aren’t what women think they are  it used to be like… okay so when a man goes to a strip club it’s all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible that’s what men want to see women when they go to their magic mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are… women wanna see a guy “hey ladies he’s a fireman” and he comes out with his hose and like that… and whenever a stripper takes their clothes off they’ve still got the fireman’s hat on or a tool belt on or policeman’s gun on a holster right because even when a man’s naked a woman wants to know that he has a job when men watch strippers we want them to have a job and that job’s stripping we want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money and just go… “you can’t take care of your kids” it’s… and when men get private dances in these strip clubs i don’t know… i don’t know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms but basically it’s dry humping there’s no dancing the girl gets in front she gets where your cock is pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it… and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face and you go… that’s what a private “dance” is right i don’t know if there’s private dancing in female strip clubs  i can’t imagine that there would be i don’t imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going… she goes “how was it” and she goes “well… he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals… and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead i got to go to the atm” so legit got canceled  yeah i know i know it who would’ve thought it would’ve struggled on that great fxx channel that everyone knew about the first season is on netflix this special is being recorded for netflix so you can go watch it there if you’re watching the special it was… i’m very proud of it we had two great seasons of really good television and if people didn’t… now… the whole tv show is based around one standup routine that i used to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that i took to a brothel which is a true story and so when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who… in the end we used dj qualls and dj qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie road trip he’s the skinny white guy out of the movie hustle  flow and he’s the white guy out of the movie hustle  flow now… the great thing about dj is… he already looks disabled he has that “latter stages of aids” thing going on it’s great for casting anyway but… i didn’t want dj to begin with i wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic and the actors’ union of america said “you cannot do that” because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy i think are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired and i said “all right what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer” and they sent me a list and on this list i said “can you get rid of all the contagious ones and what have we got left” so i saw every disabled actor in hollywood and i’ll be honest with you not that many of them i don’t know why maybe they’re just lazy they don’t wanna work maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly and none of them were very good either everyone we saw none of them were very good ’cause acting is all about what you do with your hands none of them knew what to do with their hands and… they all came in until this one guy came in i had seen a lot of people that day this guy was the most disabled person i’d ever seen in my life he was like… think of the most disabled person you’ve seen then double it …really super disabled he was shaped like a pretzel he was being carried in by this big russian nurse carried him in he made that great disabled sound of…  that one i just loved him anyway… so he comes in for the audition… and i’m sitting there and we’re doing the lines together and at first i didn’t know if he was mentally all there either so i was being a little bit patronizing i was going “thank you so much for coming in” and then we did the dialog together and i didn’t have to worry about a thing this kid was funny he was smart his timing was impeccable i thought he was just great and i helped him out of the room and i come back to the director and i said “that’s our guy that’s who we gotta pick” and he agreed but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room so the next bloke wheels himself in now obviously he’s just a paraplegic if he’s wheeling himself in which means the waist down and that didn’t really suit me because… paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance but i thought… “if he’s a good enough actor maybe he can quadup for the role” so he comes in… he comes in i shake his hand and his leg slightly comes out at the same time and i went “whoa what’s going on there kicky” and he goes… “oh you got me i’m not disabled” and i said “you’re fucking what now” and he goes “i’m not disabled i just really wanted the role so i rented a wheelchair” and i said “just shut up so let me… this is how your day has mappedout thus far you woke up this morning you drove to the wheelchair rental place you rented a wheelchair you carried it out i assume you put it in the trunk of your car you drove here you got the wheelchair out you carried it up three flights of stairs you went to the waiting room you put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse then you sat in it and practiced your lines” and he went… “yeah” and i said “you’re a fucking asshole mate get the fuck out of here” and i kicked him out and later on that day i’m sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors i’m gonna call to tell them they’ve got parts and i’m holding this disabled guy’s headshot and i just think “i’m gonna call this guy up i’m gonna change his life this is an awesome moment right” and i’m looking at it and he looks super handsome in his headshot he looked really like… and i thought “this has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history” the shutter on his camera has gotta be like…  like…  and then i read the guy’s biography… and then it dawned on me “this guy’s not disabled either i hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair this cunt rented a nurse” do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse i’m all for a method actor get into character three hours before but once you finish the audition stand up and go “tada” and we would have gone “that was very good” but i’ll tell you what you don’t do don’t make me carry you to your car i carried him down three flights of stairs going “you did very good” he’s like “thank you jim”   i was uh… i go to a therapist… ’cause i get depressed so i got a therapist every now and again i literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like “i’m gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind” like just out of the movies right and she went “red” and i went “blue” and then she went “cooking” and i went “food” and all that type of stuff we went like this forever and then she went… for the last question she went “and what’s your favorite thing in the world” and i went… “coming on a girl’s face” now… now i could’ve said things like… “ice cream” is a good answer “hank” would’ve been an excellent answer but i said “coming on a girl’s face” and i’ve had six months to think about my answer and i stand by it – i… –  i’m not proud of it i hate myself for thinking it it’s such a horrible thing to do to another human when a girl’s on her knees and you… it’s so… and as an atheist i believe in darwin and all the things that he wrote but he never had a bit where he explained that there was never a bit in his book where he went “when a caveman loves a cavewoman he’ll ejaculate on her face so that flies won’t come near” there was never that… never that moment but by golly if it’s not fun i find it… to… look to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time may i say “bravo” don’t… don’t think what you do… has gone unnoticed we notice we appreciate your work i think you deserve a parade of some kind during memorial day after the vietnam vets before the first gulf war guys we could bring in “and here’s the women who take a load on their face” and you could march out and married men would stand there going “god bless you ladies”  i enjoy your acting that you do the standard tongue out and the… like that… i don’t know why but i enjoy… i know it’s a lie i know you’re not excited but i still appreciate the effort is what i enjoy i love the look because it’s such a “oh jeez i’m excited too when this come hits my face there’s a good chance i’ll also orgasm anything could happen in this crazy world” but this is what redeems us as men this is what redeems us just know that the second the come shoots out of our cock and hits your face our bodies flood with remorse the next 20 seconds is the nicest we will ever be to you  i go from being an animal to the sweetest guy on earth i’m like “you fucking slut… oh i love you ah… uh all right no no no put your tongue back in um… keep your eyes shut just keep them shut uh… all right i’m going to get a towel i’ll get a towel i’ll get you a towel all right you’re a wonderful mother to our child”   see… this is what kills me my son will one day watch this dvd and i’m the guy who’s meant to teach him right from wrong and i’m there wiping come off his mother’s face i think i did something illegal with my son the other day i think it might be illegal tell me if this is illegal all right i’m in the shower my girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning and when she came back i was in the shower and hank ran up and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like “argh” like that and i went…  and i saw his little face and i went “hello hankie” and then in the condensation i drew a little bowtie on him… and a little suit… and then i gave him a voice bubble that said “i love my daddy love hank” but i did it so i could read it well of course he could read the “k” and… then i stepped out i stepped out of the bathroom and i went “g’day hankie” and he slapped my cock and he ran off now is that illegal i don’t know is it illegal because a a child touched my cock or because b i found it really funny and i’ve been telling everyone and i can’t get angry at him because his whole life he’s been lying on mats with things dangling over he’s been training for this his entire life i think i’ve uh… i think i’ve become american more american than i am australian lately and there was a moment where i tipped over where i went “oh i think like an american person now” and i’m happy to do it i just… i’ll tell you what happened i was flying around… i was doing a tour of australia and i was flying domestically around australia and i’m so used to airports and stuff here in america that… okay what happens is when you go… i was flying sydney to melbourne when you fly domestically in australia you go up to the machine put your name in prints your ticket out it prints your bag thing you put the bag thing on your bag yourself and then there’s a conveyor belt underneath you throw your bag on bag fucks off you don’t speak to anyone then i go up to the gate bit and the lady’s going “tickets please” and i’m holding my id out like a fucking simpleton ‘cause i get through airports quick man i’m like “fucking there you go” and she went “put your id away i don’t need to see that” and i went… “i think you do” and she went “i don’t… why would i need to see your id” and i said “i might be a terrorist” and she went “would showing me your id stop you from blowing the plane up” “no i’d probably still blow the plane up” so then i get up to the tsa conveyor belt thing and i’m so good at the airports i’m already taking my shoes off as i’m walking right and all the australians behind me assume that i’m american and they’re losing their fucking shit they’re like “oh for fuck’s sake one of these cunts eh” and the tsa guy goes “hey mate what are you taking your shoes off for” and i went…  “i don’t know maybe they’re bombs” and he went… “but they’re not are they” i put me shoes back on i get my laptop out everyone’s going mental and the tsa guy says very politely but extraordinarily sarcastically he goes “jeez mate that’s a nice computer why are you showing it to everyone” “it might also be a bomb” and then the guy said the most australian thing i’ve ever heard come out of anyone’s mouth ever he went… “oh come on mate you wouldn’t have two bombs”   i’m not even quite sure what that means but it does make some type of sense all right oscar pistorius if you haven’t been following the case you’re missing out this is the greatest thing since oj simpson you’re fucking missing out mate if you don’t know who oscar pistorius is let me fill you in oscar pistorius is a legless man from south africa known as the blade runner he ran in two olympics the disabled and the ablebodied olympics in one year no one has ever done that he’s an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and ablebodied people alike and on valentine’s day last year he shot and killed the hottest girl on earth… and that’s when he became an inspiration to me… ’cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there you can’t just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want  people have feelings you cunts now there’s a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day one of the theories is that they found in her phone… he went through her phone and on her phone he found some text messages from a south african rugby player on valentine’s day right now i don’t know if you’ve ever been to south africa but in south africa rugby is more popular than legless running it goes rugby legless running cricket legless running’s their second sport you wouldn’t have thought that anyway… i’m going to reenact what i believe happened that day to do that i will now be doing a south african accent now i know many of you can’t tell the difference between my accent and a south african accent here’s the difference picture my accent but i’m punching a black person what i’m trying to say is south africans are horrible people so… she’s coming out of the shower she’s been drying her hair she’s listening to rodriguez or something she comes out he’s laying on the bed he looks up at her he’s holding the phone and he goes  “what the fuck is this i’ve been through your phone you have been texting a rugby player” and she’s like “oh fuck you who the fuck do you think you are” “who am i i’m oscar pistorius the greatest legless runner that has ever been that’s who the fuck i am” “well i would rather be with a rugby player at least he is a whole man not a threequarter man like you” –  – i know  “oh fuck you” “no fuck you i’m leaving you” and then she storms out of the room and then he was like… “you fucking bitch  i hate you  you will rue the day… that you left oscar pistorius the blade runner don’t go anywhere  i hate you” that’s where he keeps his legs all right then he put the blades on “oh you’re in trouble missy i tell you i go to my gun safe” she locked herself in the bathroom he shot her through the bathroom door seems like overkill doesn’t it bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them but oscar’s one of the few men on earth that couldn’t kick the door in right he was wearing the blades so… boing ah so… i think oscar will probably go to prison now… in south africa one in four people have aids i assume it may even be worse in the prison population now can i say this look… i’ve never raped a man i hate that i have to put “a man” in that sentence but whatever i’ve never raped a man but… if i was going to rape a man it would be a legless olympian… ’cause in prison it’s all about getting one up on other people and making people think you’re tough and all that like “you want to fucking rape me i just raped an olympian bitch is that what you fucking want” there’d be a wonderful moment… when you’re in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a terminator movie  you know what i like about that joke so often when you tell a joke the rapist is the villain in the story but not in that one not in that one he’s the hero all right we have to get going soon before i leave – i thank you very much for coming –  no i said “soon” not “over” it’s just soon you cunts so calm down   i always… i always find that weird when someone like whistles like that what do they think is going to happen like i’m going to go “fucking you know me mate i was enjoying claps and cheers but what i needed was a highpitched squeal noise thank god you came along to pick up my spirits”  love you all right final story now i was in south africa again jeez i don’t think i’ll be working in south africa after this special comes out i used to do like one tour in south africa every year and i just don’t know if i’ll be invited this time they’ll be like  “we don’t like him he’s no good” anyway so i’m in south africa and i had to fly back from cape town to los angeles which is like a 26hour flight you’ve to go up to london and go across cunt of a trip um… but it was all right ’cause i had a business class ticket so i didn’t give a fuck and when i travel economy i try to dress up nice ’cause i like to look good in case someone recognizes me and i might get an upgrade but when i’ve already got a business class ticket i try to look like a bag of shit… ’cause it’s important to me that everyone else in business class doesn’t want me there and they’re annoyed by my presence so… i’m wearing a white tshirt that’s got brown stains on it with a hole in the side i’m wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out so anyway i go up to the counter up to the business thing with the thing and i go “hello” and the lady goes  “oh mr jefferies i’m so sorry but you have been downgraded” i said “you what now” she goes “business class is full you have been downgraded” and i said “i understand that business class is full i bought one of the tickets that made it full” and she went “i’m sorry sir there’s nothing i can do” and then i just went “are you fucking kidding me” now you know when you’re dealing with customer service people and they want you to swear ’cause as soon as you swear they don’t have to engage with you anymore they can act like they’re the first adult never to hear a swear word and they can get really offended right so i went “are you fucking kidding me” and she went “please do not speak to me that way i have done nothing wrong” and i said “are you a white south african telling me you’ve done nothing wrong” anyway… tensions rose the manager comes over big fat cunt called simon fulcher right he walks over and goes  “what is wrong here what is wrong” and i said “i bought a business class ticket and i want a business class ticket” and he goes “what do you want me to do make a new chair for you there are no more seats i can’t do anything” he goes “i’ll tell you what i can do go up to the executive lounge have some peanuts enjoy a beverage listen to rodriguez and if something opens up we will move you back up to business class so i thought “there’s nothing i can do” so i walk off with my ticket i’m walking through the airport like “fucking british airways bunch of fucking cunts” right i get up to the counter and the woman behind the counter said “tickets please” and i hand over my ticket and she goes  “i’m sorry sir but this is for business class passengers only your ticket says ‘economy’ on it” and i said…  “i bought a business class ticket but you people have downgraded…” and as i was doing my little speech she looked past me and went “next”  “listen here you fucking cunt”  all right now you say “cunt” in any foreign country people lose their fucking shit security came from everywhere i was going “don’t you fucking come near me cunt” and i said “i want to speak to simon fulcher” like i’m… and they go “all right” they ring the manager up and then they go… he goes “is it the pale australian man” and the guy went “yes” he goes “we’ve had problems with him let him through” right so i go through i’m sitting there i’m eating my peanuts and i’m just angry now going “fucking british airways fucking cunts fucking…” like that and in walks in a group of americans about 30 of them you know the type right they all… and whenever i see americans abroad… i’ll do my impersonation of any american abroad when americans are abroad you’re just pointing out shit you see you’re just walking around going  “oh this is great look at that that’s a chair right there okay oh what’s that over there okay wonderful great” right and this group walked in and one of the women in the group went like this she went  “did anyone else see that australian guy speaking to that lady out there some people have no class” and i put my head around the pylon and i went “you can fuck off and all you don’t know what i’ve been through i’ve been downgraded” and as i said that 18 other people who were given the same lie that i was given that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class the penny dropped none of us are getting promoted they all lied to us and we formed an angry militia in seconds it was like a scene out of braveheart and they all stood up and went “fucking downgraded” and the woman in the group was doing this “don’t speak to me that way who the hell do you think you are” and all the men in the group were like “hey why don’t you shut the fuck up just shut the fuck up” ♪ it doesn’t matter these people seem very angry so ♪ and a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down and sometimes americans sometimes you can seem a little insincere and he came up and he went  “hey hey yeah i get it  downgraded yeah that really grinds my gears i tell you that yeah i would write a stronglyworded letter i really would” and then i thought at least this guy’s being nice and i said “look mate don’t worry about it it’s not like it’s your fault” and i said “why are you in such a big group anyway” and he goes “oh we’re in neil diamond’s band that’s neil diamond’s backup singer you just called a cunt there” and as he said that neil diamond walked around the corner like a fucking superhero… and i reacted like he was one i went “neil diamond” and neil diamond went  “hey what’s going on” and then for a second there there was a bit of my brain that thought maybe neil diamond could solve problems and i went “neil me and all these people we’ve been downgraded” and neil went “oh oh right uh well maybe that’s our fault we decided to come back a day early” “you can fuck off and all neil diamond” and then a fight breaks out amongst the neil diamond band and the downgraded punches are thrown not by me i don’t know if you have the internet but i’m not much of a fighter i’m an excellent scurrierawayer i get down “hey what have you got there hiya” anyway the airport police came three people were arrested from the downgraded… but three people were arrested from the neil diamond band and that meant that three seats opened up in business class  ladies and gentlemen thank you very much good night appreciate it   thank you go home let’s have a drink bye your email

love you i’m at the end of the tour right now i’m very happy to be on tour because i now have a child ah so… any time out of home is good for me um i got my girlfriend pregnant after knowing her for two months so…  thank you thank you life decisions and she’s a nice girl and i love her in a way sure my problem with my girlfriend is she’s very sweet but she’s shit at telling stories and i’m awesome at telling stories so it really bothers me when she talks and i don’t know if that’ll be a problem in the future but it’s a problem now and i don’t see it getting better um… i’ll give you an example right i was in the car and my son hank was asleep in the back seat and we’re driving along and on the radio comes madonna and my girlfriend just slips into conversation “oh i used to party with madonna” and i went “you fucking what when” and she went “i used to party with madonna” now i should fill you in a little bit on this my girlfriend used to be a model in miami right i’m not bragging i didn’t get the model years i didn’t get those years i’ve seen the photos very impressive um… so i said “so you used to party with madonna madonna used to have big parties and invite models over right” and she went “no no it would just be me and a few other people” i go “you need to elaborate on this story right now” and she goes “oh okay i used to date the center for the miami heat” as soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an nba center even if this guy’s even slightly in proportion… a lot of things flood through your head first thing is “that’s why your cunt’s so fucked up” that’s a big one “that’s why our child came out while you were walking i understand” so she said “i used to date the center for the miami heat his best friend was dennis rodman dennis rodman used to go out with madonna and we used to go over to madonna’s house” and she goes “this one time the four of us were over at madonna’s house and we were all fucked up on drugs and one thing led to another…” and then i went “shut the fuck up” and she went “what” i said “i know what ‘one thing led to another’ means you all started fucking each other” and she went “we did we started…” “just shut up” and she goes “what do you care for” i said “you’re the mother of my child i don’t wanna picture you being fucked by a ’″ nba player while you’re licking out madonna’s muscular vagina and dennis rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock going…”  and she goes “oh you’re being silly what do you care for you’ve partied way more than i have in my life” and i went “that is not true i’ve gotten wasted way more than you have but i have in no way partied way more than you have often i get wasted just by myself i wouldn’t call it a party” for most of my career i was a struggling comedian right and this is how struggling comedians party right it’s  am monday right we’re in a onebedroom apartment seven of us are standing around a coffee table trying to stretch out two grams of coke one of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories… and the rest of us are talking about where women might be one of us has come up with a plan the plan goes like this “well… nurses will be finishing their shift soon maybe if we just stand out the front of the er they’ll appreciate seven funny guys”  i don’t… you know i’ve never partied like a model i have partied twice in my life twice like really partied i’ve had good nights out but i’ve really partied twice if you really party and most people never experience this it’s an amazing thing it happens in vegas it can only happen in vegas and it’s gotta involve celebrity right i’m not famous but the people around me were super famous and i was at this party in the night club and they took me in and then there’s the night club but then there’s the real night club out the back which is like the size of this stage it’s only a little room and you go back there and you can just… they encourage you to take drugs in the open and you’re just doing it off a key  and they’re going “no dude use the table don’t use your…” and i go “oh oh oh sorry um…” and it’s confusing at first and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room just bring ’em in like “huh” and you can do this you can go… “uh…” like that and they’ll drag these women away it is the best thing you’ll ever do with your life when you party that hard as a man there’s a lot of remorse ’cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money you wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover and you go to your friends you go “oh my god we partied so hard last night i spent ” when a hot girl parties that hard she wakes up in the morning and goes “oh my god we partied so hard last night i made ” and that’s a vastly different emotion that… i don’t think women will never… yeah okay this is the thing in america at the moment they’re trying to raise the minimum wage to i don’t know  an hour or something like that and whenever they bring up this argument they always go “and still to this day women only earn  of what men earn in the workplace” and of course that’s disgusting how dare women earn so much like… a lot of things that i say tonight will be jokes that i don’t actually mean but this is something i’m really passionate about women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace i’m sorry i…  i’m not being a misogynistic bastard right i’m not saying that women don’t work as hard i’m sure they do i’m not saying they don’t do as good a job what i’m saying is they don’t deserve to earn as much money as men right men need that extra  to buy meals and drinks and jim jefferies tickets and all that shit  now… i’m sure there’s women in this room that are saying “oh i pay for my drinks i bought my own ticket” and don’t think we don’t appreciate the uglies ’cause we do right we do but there’s little things in society that you can’t change men have extra expenses that you’ll never understand there’s holidays that are just for women like valentine’s day is just for women they say it’s for romantics they say it’s for couples or something like that it’s just for women there’s no man who gets excited by valentine’s day there’s no man that when he sees the valentine’s day decorations go up in the shopping mall he goes “oh valentine’s day is coming” valentine’s day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head and it goes like this “how much money do i have to spend today so that you won’t act like a cunt” it doesn’t stop there mother’s day mother’s day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old my girlfriend’s first mother’s day and she went “oh i wonder what i’ll get for mother’s day” and i went “probably fucking nothing he’s got no money he’s six months old what do you think he’s gonna buy you” within an hour her friends were over at the house just by coincidence telling me what a bad person i was and how important mother’s day is to a new mum you know and so i went and bought her a cappuccino machine ’cause i assumed that’s what hank would have wanted her to have… and i wrote a card i’m not a bastard i wrote a card i’m righthanded so i got my left hand every new dad knows this you get the crayon and you go  “happy mother’s day love hank” and i went “han…” and then i did the “k” backtofront because he’s a fucking moron see now i know there’s people in the room they’re thinking “well fathers have father’s day” father’s day is bullshit it’s fucking shit father’s day father’s day came around and my girlfriend went “what do you want for father’s day” and i went “i don’t want anything don’t even worry about it i don’t want anything” and she goes “come on you gotta have something” i said “honestly i don’t want anything” and she goes “come on” and i went “it’s my fucking money just don’t touch it just leave my money alone how hard is this how about for  hours you don’t touch my fucking money that would be a gift” that’s why every single father has that one father’s day gift that they cherish and it’s shit it’s like a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handle’s too big and it says “i heart dad” and they keep that for  fucking years this mug and do you wanna know why they like it every now and again they look at it and go… “that cost me nothing that mug”  see… wouldn’t it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff but didn’t cost anything that everyone could participate in right i’ve got it right april … anal sex day  it’s good isn’t it everyone’s girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on april  it’s nice a month before you’d be walking around the shopping center going “oh the decorations are up”  and it’s good ’cause if your bird didn’t take it in the ass you could do the same thing that women do on valentine’s day when they don’t get a gift you could go like “oh me mate jason his wife took it in the ass twice yeah obviously they’re more connected than we are they’ve uh…” i’m thinking i don’t do much merchandise after my shows and stuff but i’m thinking of bringing out some april  tshirts not even putting “jim jefferies” on them or anything just tshirts that say “april ” ‘cause it’s good right you’re in a bar you’re a guy you see a guy at the other end of the bar with an april  and you go… fucking friends for life right but even better you see a girl with an april  tshirt the weird thing is i’m biggingup anal sex here and i don’t even really like fucking girls in the ass that much i’m not even a huge fan i much prefer the cunt i think it’s a much more… i think that a cunt is a much more purposebuilt thing to fuck but you know anal sex… oh you know… i do it i get involved ’cause i feel like i have to you know i… but i’ve never been a big fan of the ass fucking i uh… when i watch it on porn it seems very inviting the girl’s taking it so fluently in her ass and she seems to be having fun and uh… but the thing is you can’t smell porn you don’t smell porn you just… you just watch it they never… and it’s different porn it’s different they clean the girl’s asshole they pump water into it until it’s very hygienic i’m sure and the girl seems to be so happy she’s like… you’ve got it in her pussy you’re fucking her and then she’s like “put it in my ass” she’s inviting it’s like you’re doing her a favor in porn and then she’s like… she says things… i don’t know things like “i’m enjoying that keep putting it in my ass fuck my ass i love a cock in my ass” and… and the experience i’ve had in my own life has been vastly different i’ve… my experience has been a lot of crying now although that can help you come at times it’s not what you want… it’s not what you want for every day i like the girl who acts like she’s enjoying it like you know when your girlfriend’s like “i’m gonna act like i enjoy it” she does that whole “yeah oh no that’s good”  ahh ♪ i’m having a good time ♪ and then they’re always going “are you done are you close to done” you never fuck a pussy and they go “are you almost done finish this” like that if you’re fucking ass they don’t want you… they want it all over quick and they do other things the porn girls i don’t know how much they get paid i’m sure it’s more than what the men get paid it’s the opposite bit of society um… but they do a thing called “atm” i don’t know if you know what that is kids that stands for “ass to mouth” that’s where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus and she’ll put it directly in her mouth and she’ll say something like “i love the taste of my ass let me taste my ass” and then the man as a favor to this woman puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work…  she’s been doing now i had a drunken night with my exgirlfriend where she thought she’d be all wild and try that once again vastly different experience i’m not a big fan of the ass fucking and i don’t know of any man if they’re truthful really is now there’s women in the room who are thinking “well why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass”  what a good question  women the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because… we know you fucking hate it  so… i’m a father um… i love my son i love my son the same way that i love cigarettes i like to hold him for five minutes every hour and the rest of the time i’m thinking about how he’s fucking killing me he’s a good little boy no he’s a great little fella i really like him um… my girlfriend super loves him though it’s fucking creepy and… i’m glad i have a son that worked out good for me i wouldn’t be a good father to a girl it wouldn’t be good for me nothing weird wouldn’t fuck it i… i just don’t get along with women you know how it is i don’t want them in my house and… so… because you dream see… for example okay when hank was born… the couple over the road within two weeks of hank being born had a baby girl and rightly or wrongly the first thing that went through my head was… “aw that’s great i hope hank fucks that one day” that’s what i think… ‘cause that’s what i think about my son i hope when he’s of age he just fucks everything i don’t care if my son is gay or straight all i care about is when he is of age that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires that is my dream for my son  but never in the history of fathers and daughters has a father held his baby girl and gone “oh i hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life i hope you’re never shy of a cock i hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up” right you know… and it’s not just me women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well my girlfriend goes to the gym every morning i go there very occasionally and when you go to the gym there’s a little daycare crèche thing in the gym where you can hand your child off and inside that daycare there’s like three women in their  they’re very nice ladies and you hand your kid off and he plays then when you finish your workout you come and get him and there’s a woman that works there who just loves my son she sees all the other kids but she loves hank and hank fucking loves her and the two of them light up when they see each other and it’s super cute i bring hank up the stairs and he starts going “uh uh” trying to reach at her all right and she does this she goes “everyone my boyfriend’s here here’s my boyfriend give him here he’s my boyfriend” and then she kisses him and she goes ♪ my boyfriend gives me kisses my boyfriend gives me kisses ♪ it’s fucking adorable but i tried doing that with a baby girl… let’s say you go to the gym and there’s a daycare and me and a couple of my mates are working there “hey everyone… me girlfriend’s here give her here give her here she’s my girlfriend my girlfriend gives me kisses you know that right she’s always giving me kisses enjoy your workout don’t worry about a thing”   so… also… it’s just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter it’s just little things even when they’re babies it’s just easier there’s a wiping technique when you’re wiping a baby’s ass i don’t know if you have children but this is how you do it the baby lays on its back you put their feet together you lift the feet up and then you go in and wipe with a boy you can wipe like that up and down side to side whatever the fuck you want right with a girl you gotta wipe downward and away downward and away it’s very important that you wipe away from the cunt very important ‘cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts they do they fucking hate it boys don’t give a shit fucking… my son will have shit all over his dick and balls and i’ll be cleaning it off under the foreskin and he’ll be laughing like it’s the best day ever even at my age now i find it funny if i have shit on my dick if i fuck my girlfriend in the ass i pull out i’ve got shit on my dick i’ll ring me mate jason up and go “hey jason… it’s happened again i got shit on my dick” and he’ll tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick and we’ll laugh and laugh and laugh but never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and she’s thought “oh i can’t wait to call karen”   when you… when my girlfriend got pregnant… when you meet… when you haven’t got a child couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children whenever you meet couples with children they’re always like “it is the most fulfilling thing i’ve ever done with my life my heart grows larger and larger every day” and then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant those same people went like this “you’re never gonna sleep again  forget about it it’s over you’re not gonna sleep” they’re constantly telling you you’re not gonna sleep raising a baby is not that hard i’ll tell you what it’s easier than a coke habit i had a coke habit for sevenandahalf fucking years at least it’s not me who wakes up crying anymore i can sleep through other people crying i’ve had girlfriends that’s like white noise to me i find it soothing see me and my girlfriend just two months we went “fuck it let’s have a kid” fucking did it right these other people man… you know these couples and they date from high school and then they go out for a bit longer and then after being together for like seven years they go “we’re getting engaged you wanna come to the party” and you wanna say “no you’re really boring and we hate you” but you go “oh okay great you’re still together are you you fucked one person have you oh how exciting” and… and then what they do is they don’t have a kid right away because they’re still not ready “we have to see how our careers are going and shit” and what they do is they get a dog and then they act like the fucking dog’s their baby they refer to it as their fucking baby they send you a christmas card of them holding the dog… and it says “from our family to yours” and then you have a barbecue and you invite them the humans right then they come over this fucking dog runs in jumping over everything and you’re like “what the fuck is this shit” and they’re like “we had to bring him we bring our baby everywhere” and you go “well your baby is biting my actual baby can you control…” and then eventually they decide they’re gonna have a kid ’cause they’ve learned so much from the dog and then they bring the kid back and the dog runs up like “what’s happening a new person” and they’re like “fuck off we don’t love you anymore we’re going” and they think they’ve learnt something from the dog and they haven’t learnt anything what happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the dog dies you go off you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog… try to pass it off as the same dog what happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the baby dies very hard… to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have easier if you’re black or asian  boston no no no shut up i will not put up with racism at my shows okay i’m not saying ’cause they look the same i’m saying ’cause they’re easier to purchase   if angelina jolie and madonna have taught us anything… it is that you can buy black and asian people i’m yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from norway with a child going… “yolanda quick get hans bring him over come on”  i’m gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit uh… gun control now… no wait before you… don’t get excited because the other people have guns the antigun people are like “yeah do it jim” no let’s just…  now before i start saying this i wanna say this right i believe in your right as americans to have guns i’m not trying to stop you from having guns all i’m saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion my opinion on the… oh it doesn’t matter i don’t like guns right i’m gonna say some things that are just facts right in australia we had guns right right up until  in  australia had the biggest massacre on earth it still hasn’t been beaten and… now after that they banned the guns now in the  years before port arthur there was  massacres since the gun ban in  there hasn’t been a single massacre since i don’t know how or why this happened uh… maybe it was a coincidence right now please understand that i understand that australia and america are two vastly different cultures with different people right i get it in australia we had the biggest massacre on earth and the australian government went “that’s it no more guns” and we all went “yeah all right then that seems fair enough really” now in america you had the sandy hook massacre where little tiny children died and your government went “maybe… we’ll get rid of the big guns” and  of you went “fuck you don’t take my guns”  so here’s where it gets confusing right now as i said i am all for your second amendment rights i think you should be able to have guns it’s in your constitution what i am not for is bullshit arguments and lies there is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun and this is the argument… “fuck off i like guns” it’s not the best argument but it’s all you’ve got and there’s nothing wrong with it there’s nothing wrong with saying “i like something don’t take it away from me” but don’t give me this other bullshit the main one is  “i need it for protection i need to protect me i need to protect my family” really is that why they’re called “assault rifles” is it i’ve never heard of these fucking “protection rifles” you speak of protection what the fuck are you talking about you have a gun in your house you’re  more likely to use that gun on yourself than to shoot someone else and people think “well that’d never happen to me” you don’t know that because you know what\n",
            "♪ from time to time we all get sad ♪ \n",
            "♪ one day you’re happy then you’re sad ♪ \n",
            "♪ and then uhoh ♪\n",
            "protection i had a breakin in manchester england where i was tied up i had my head cut they threatened to rape my girlfriend they came through the window with a machete and a hammer and americans always go  “well imagine if you had a gun” and i’m like “all right i was naked at the time i wasn’t wearing my holster i wasn’t staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through” what world do you live in where you’re constantly fucking ready you have guns ’cause you like guns that’s why you go to gun conventions that’s why you read gun magazines none of you give a shit about home security none of you go to home security conventions none of you read padlock monthly none of you have a facebook picture of you behind a secure door going “fucking yeah” like you’re going to be ready if someone comes into your house you have it at all fucking times by the way most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking tv you think that people are coming to murder your family how many fucking enemies do you have jeez you think a lot of yourself if you think everyone’s coming to murder you see if you have it readily available it becomes unsafe you have it in your bedside table one of your kids picks it up thinks it’s a toy shoots another one of your kids happens every fucking day but people go “that’d never happen in my house ’cause i’m a responsible gun owner i keep my guns locked in a safe” then they’re no fucking protection someone comes into the house you’re like “wait there fuckface oh you’ve come to the wrong house here buddy boy i tell you what i’m gonna fuck you up okay is it  to the left or  to the right your mother’s birthday why the fuck would i know your fucking mother’s birthday maybe if you didn’t leave the window open  ‘because it’s too hot in here’ we wouldn’t be getting fucking murdered right” i find the nra to be hard work the fact that they always think the answer is more guns after sandy hook happened the nra said and i quote “none of this would have happened if the teachers had guns” i… i think they’re forgetting what school was like does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to… whenever she came into school that relief teacher came you and your friends would see her and go  “oh we’re gonna make her cry” and then she’d stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking and you’d go “you’re never getting married are you miss never gonna happen for you” then she’d get back to her  volkswagen beetle and she’d be crying over the steering wheel just “why don’t they like me” let’s give that cunt a gun and see how things work out  and then they go “oh well answer to that we’ll just add more guns” they go “we’ll put an armed security guard at every school across america” yeah that’ll work out the average security guard in america earns  an hour not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero someone comes onto the school and…  and you’ve got kevin now i’m sure kevin’s shithot at call of duty but it might not fucking cut it ladies and gentlemen now i understand that when i’m doing this joke in this room  of you agree with me  of you don’t agree with me and i do respect the people who don’t agree with me don’t think i don’t out of the  that don’t agree with me  of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and it’s not to be taken seriously and they’re laughing along ’cause it’s just funny jokes right and then the next  have sort of phased out a little bit they’re looking around going “wonder how they got that chandelier up there” and then… there’s the last  and they’re fucking furious right now in this room and the people watching at home…  of you are fucking seething just… and for a couple of reasons first reason i’m making good points  second reason second reason second reason and this is the big one i’m foreign… and that’s pissing the fuck out of you right now and your brain is on a loop and you can’t fucking turn it off and it’s just going around in a circle and you’re just going “if you don’t like it go home if you don’t like it go home” and my answer to that is “no” i came here legally i pay my taxes i’ll say whatever the fuck i want your first amendment means that i can say the second amendment sucks dicks and… unless you’re an american indian you’re a fucking immigrant as well so fuck off people get so precious about it i understand that to americans your constitution is very important i respect it but please understand that every country has one as well it’s no more special than any other constitution we have one in australia i don’t know what it says i’ve never seen it if there’s a problem we’ll check it but everything’s going fine and don’t get me wrong i get that the constitution is important to you i have had… fucking i get it right i’ve had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as i’m leaving the theater going  “you cannot change the second amendment” and i’m like “yes you can it’s called an ‘amendment” if you can’t change something that’s called an “amendment” see many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution and if you don’t know what a thesaurus is get a dictionary and work your way forward don’t think your constitution is set in stone you’ve changed things before you used to have prohibition in there right and then people were like “hey who likes getting fucked up yeah i like getting fucked up too let’s get that one out let’s get that one out” you used to have this other thing in america called uh… slavery and then lincoln came along and went “that’s it no more slaves” and  of you went “fuck you don’t take my slaves” and the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns “why should i have my slaves taken off me i’m a responsible slave owner i’m trained in how to use my slaves safely just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesn’t mean that my rights should be taken away from me i… i use my slaves to protect my family i keep my slaves locked in a safe” that’s the thing “why should i have my guns taken off me i’ve done nothing wrong” look i agree with you if you’re a responsible gun owner and you don’t fuck around with them then you should be allowed your guns you really should but that’s not how society works we have to play to the  that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us we have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving right i take drugs like a fucking champion right  we should all be allowed to take fucking drugs but we can’t can we because sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids oh “oh thanks sarah you fucked it up for everyone” right everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it right but we can’t because jonathan got drunk and ran over a family “thanks jonathan now i have to drive at  you fucking idiot” see that’s the thing “why should i have my guns taken off me i’m responsible just because that guy’s crazy” who’s to say you’re not crazy that’s the thing about crazy people they don’t know they’re crazy that’s what makes them crazy the only thing you know for sure on this earth is “i think therefore i am” you know that you exist anything past that is open to interpretation right you know you exist and that’s it right now i think i’m in boston talking to  people that’s what i think i’m doing but there is a good to fair chance that i’m in a mental home standing in front of a white wall going  “i hate guns i hate guns i hate guns”  see one of the better arguments is “well if you take the guns away then only the criminals will have guns” not true when they banned the guns in australia it worked when they banned them in britain it worked okay the bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in sandy hook costs like  american and you can buy it in walmart it’ll be delivered to your house that’s it man  bucks right that same gun in australia on the black market costs  now if you have  you don’t need to be a criminal you’ve got  you’re a great little saver keep going so that covers the criminals but that doesn’t cover the people who wanna murder your family that are coming after you and your family it kind of does the people who do the massacres it covers them ’cause they go… the kid at colorado who thought he was the joker let’s say that he had some social issues the kid at sandy hook was asperger’s as fuck right i don’t know if you know a lot about the black market but you can’t just rock up at the docks going  “guns who wants to sell me a gun” now i’m gonna wrap this up we won’t talk about it anymore now… see the one thing that i do really agree with with the right to bear arms i really agree with… that the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government in case the government became a bunch of cunts you could all get your guns and fight back and that’s why it was written –  – yeah and that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets but you do know the government has drones right you get that you’re bringing guns to a drone fight if we went back to muskets i’m all for it keep the second amendment if we all have muskets… muskets are awesome every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times you know what’s good about the musket it gives you a lot of time to calm down someone calls your wife fat and you’re like “fuck you buddy ah you’re not a bad guy you’re all right” now… after the show we’re gonna go out have a big party around boston see how it goes i’m not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore my girlfriend has said that’s a no… ’cause i don’t behave myself in there so i’m not allowed to go to them anymore ‘cause strip clubs aren’t what women think they are  it used to be like… okay so when a man goes to a strip club it’s all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible that’s what men want to see women when they go to their magic mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are… women wanna see a guy “hey ladies he’s a fireman” and he comes out with his hose and like that… and whenever a stripper takes their clothes off they’ve still got the fireman’s hat on or a tool belt on or policeman’s gun on a holster right because even when a man’s naked a woman wants to know that he has a job when men watch strippers we want them to have a job and that job’s stripping we want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money and just go… “you can’t take care of your kids” it’s… and when men get private dances in these strip clubs i don’t know… i don’t know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms but basically it’s dry humping there’s no dancing the girl gets in front she gets where your cock is pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it… and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face and you go… that’s what a private “dance” is right i don’t know if there’s private dancing in female strip clubs  i can’t imagine that there would be i don’t imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going… she goes “how was it” and she goes “well… he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals… and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead i got to go to the atm” so legit got canceled  yeah i know i know it who would’ve thought it would’ve struggled on that great fxx channel that everyone knew about the first season is on netflix this special is being recorded for netflix so you can go watch it there if you’re watching the special it was… i’m very proud of it we had two great seasons of really good television and if people didn’t… now… the whole tv show is based around one standup routine that i used to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that i took to a brothel which is a true story and so when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who… in the end we used dj qualls and dj qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie road trip he’s the skinny white guy out of the movie hustle  flow and he’s the white guy out of the movie hustle  flow now… the great thing about dj is… he already looks disabled he has that “latter stages of aids” thing going on it’s great for casting anyway but… i didn’t want dj to begin with i wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic and the actors’ union of america said “you cannot do that” because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy i think are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired and i said “all right what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer” and they sent me a list and on this list i said “can you get rid of all the contagious ones and what have we got left” so i saw every disabled actor in hollywood and i’ll be honest with you not that many of them i don’t know why maybe they’re just lazy they don’t wanna work maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly and none of them were very good either everyone we saw none of them were very good ’cause acting is all about what you do with your hands none of them knew what to do with their hands and… they all came in until this one guy came in i had seen a lot of people that day this guy was the most disabled person i’d ever seen in my life he was like… think of the most disabled person you’ve seen then double it …really super disabled he was shaped like a pretzel he was being carried in by this big russian nurse carried him in he made that great disabled sound of…  that one i just loved him anyway… so he comes in for the audition… and i’m sitting there and we’re doing the lines together and at first i didn’t know if he was mentally all there either so i was being a little bit patronizing i was going “thank you so much for coming in” and then we did the dialog together and i didn’t have to worry about a thing this kid was funny he was smart his timing was impeccable i thought he was just great and i helped him out of the room and i come back to the director and i said “that’s our guy that’s who we gotta pick” and he agreed but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room so the next bloke wheels himself in now obviously he’s just a paraplegic if he’s wheeling himself in which means the waist down and that didn’t really suit me because… paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance but i thought… “if he’s a good enough actor maybe he can quadup for the role” so he comes in… he comes in i shake his hand and his leg slightly comes out at the same time and i went “whoa what’s going on there kicky” and he goes… “oh you got me i’m not disabled” and i said “you’re fucking what now” and he goes “i’m not disabled i just really wanted the role so i rented a wheelchair” and i said “just shut up so let me… this is how your day has mappedout thus far you woke up this morning you drove to the wheelchair rental place you rented a wheelchair you carried it out i assume you put it in the trunk of your car you drove here you got the wheelchair out you carried it up three flights of stairs you went to the waiting room you put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse then you sat in it and practiced your lines” and he went… “yeah” and i said “you’re a fucking asshole mate get the fuck out of here” and i kicked him out and later on that day i’m sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors i’m gonna call to tell them they’ve got parts and i’m holding this disabled guy’s headshot and i just think “i’m gonna call this guy up i’m gonna change his life this is an awesome moment right” and i’m looking at it and he looks super handsome in his headshot he looked really like… and i thought “this has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history” the shutter on his camera has gotta be like…  like…  and then i read the guy’s biography… and then it dawned on me “this guy’s not disabled either i hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair this cunt rented a nurse” do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse i’m all for a method actor get into character three hours before but once you finish the audition stand up and go “tada” and we would have gone “that was very good” but i’ll tell you what you don’t do don’t make me carry you to your car i carried him down three flights of stairs going “you did very good” he’s like “thank you jim”   i was uh… i go to a therapist… ’cause i get depressed so i got a therapist every now and again i literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like “i’m gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind” like just out of the movies right and she went “red” and i went “blue” and then she went “cooking” and i went “food” and all that type of stuff we went like this forever and then she went… for the last question she went “and what’s your favorite thing in the world” and i went… “coming on a girl’s face” now… now i could’ve said things like… “ice cream” is a good answer “hank” would’ve been an excellent answer but i said “coming on a girl’s face” and i’ve had six months to think about my answer and i stand by it – i… –  i’m not proud of it i hate myself for thinking it it’s such a horrible thing to do to another human when a girl’s on her knees and you… it’s so… and as an atheist i believe in darwin and all the things that he wrote but he never had a bit where he explained that there was never a bit in his book where he went “when a caveman loves a cavewoman he’ll ejaculate on her face so that flies won’t come near” there was never that… never that moment but by golly if it’s not fun i find it… to… look to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time may i say “bravo” don’t… don’t think what you do… has gone unnoticed we notice we appreciate your work i think you deserve a parade of some kind during memorial day after the vietnam vets before the first gulf war guys we could bring in “and here’s the women who take a load on their face” and you could march out and married men would stand there going “god bless you ladies”  i enjoy your acting that you do the standard tongue out and the… like that… i don’t know why but i enjoy… i know it’s a lie i know you’re not excited but i still appreciate the effort is what i enjoy i love the look because it’s such a “oh jeez i’m excited too when this come hits my face there’s a good chance i’ll also orgasm anything could happen in this crazy world” but this is what redeems us as men this is what redeems us just know that the second the come shoots out of our cock and hits your face our bodies flood with remorse the next  seconds is the nicest we will ever be to you  i go from being an animal to the sweetest guy on earth i’m like “you fucking slut… oh i love you ah… uh all right no no no put your tongue back in um… keep your eyes shut just keep them shut uh… all right i’m going to get a towel i’ll get a towel i’ll get you a towel all right you’re a wonderful mother to our child”   see… this is what kills me my son will one day watch this dvd and i’m the guy who’s meant to teach him right from wrong and i’m there wiping come off his mother’s face i think i did something illegal with my son the other day i think it might be illegal tell me if this is illegal all right i’m in the shower my girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning and when she came back i was in the shower and hank ran up and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like “argh” like that and i went…  and i saw his little face and i went “hello hankie” and then in the condensation i drew a little bowtie on him… and a little suit… and then i gave him a voice bubble that said “i love my daddy love hank” but i did it so i could read it well of course he could read the “k” and… then i stepped out i stepped out of the bathroom and i went “g’day hankie” and he slapped my cock and he ran off now is that illegal i don’t know is it illegal because a a child touched my cock or because b i found it really funny and i’ve been telling everyone and i can’t get angry at him because his whole life he’s been lying on mats with things dangling over he’s been training for this his entire life i think i’ve uh… i think i’ve become american more american than i am australian lately and there was a moment where i tipped over where i went “oh i think like an american person now” and i’m happy to do it i just… i’ll tell you what happened i was flying around… i was doing a tour of australia and i was flying domestically around australia and i’m so used to airports and stuff here in america that… okay what happens is when you go… i was flying sydney to melbourne when you fly domestically in australia you go up to the machine put your name in prints your ticket out it prints your bag thing you put the bag thing on your bag yourself and then there’s a conveyor belt underneath you throw your bag on bag fucks off you don’t speak to anyone then i go up to the gate bit and the lady’s going “tickets please” and i’m holding my id out like a fucking simpleton ‘cause i get through airports quick man i’m like “fucking there you go” and she went “put your id away i don’t need to see that” and i went… “i think you do” and she went “i don’t… why would i need to see your id” and i said “i might be a terrorist” and she went “would showing me your id stop you from blowing the plane up” “no i’d probably still blow the plane up” so then i get up to the tsa conveyor belt thing and i’m so good at the airports i’m already taking my shoes off as i’m walking right and all the australians behind me assume that i’m american and they’re losing their fucking shit they’re like “oh for fuck’s sake one of these cunts eh” and the tsa guy goes “hey mate what are you taking your shoes off for” and i went…  “i don’t know maybe they’re bombs” and he went… “but they’re not are they” i put me shoes back on i get my laptop out everyone’s going mental and the tsa guy says very politely but extraordinarily sarcastically he goes “jeez mate that’s a nice computer why are you showing it to everyone” “it might also be a bomb” and then the guy said the most australian thing i’ve ever heard come out of anyone’s mouth ever he went… “oh come on mate you wouldn’t have two bombs”   i’m not even quite sure what that means but it does make some type of sense all right oscar pistorius if you haven’t been following the case you’re missing out this is the greatest thing since oj simpson you’re fucking missing out mate if you don’t know who oscar pistorius is let me fill you in oscar pistorius is a legless man from south africa known as the blade runner he ran in two olympics the disabled and the ablebodied olympics in one year no one has ever done that he’s an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and ablebodied people alike and on valentine’s day last year he shot and killed the hottest girl on earth… and that’s when he became an inspiration to me… ’cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there you can’t just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want  people have feelings you cunts now there’s a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day one of the theories is that they found in her phone… he went through her phone and on her phone he found some text messages from a south african rugby player on valentine’s day right now i don’t know if you’ve ever been to south africa but in south africa rugby is more popular than legless running it goes rugby legless running cricket legless running’s their second sport you wouldn’t have thought that anyway… i’m going to reenact what i believe happened that day to do that i will now be doing a south african accent now i know many of you can’t tell the difference between my accent and a south african accent here’s the difference picture my accent but i’m punching a black person what i’m trying to say is south africans are horrible people so… she’s coming out of the shower she’s been drying her hair she’s listening to rodriguez or something she comes out he’s laying on the bed he looks up at her he’s holding the phone and he goes  “what the fuck is this i’ve been through your phone you have been texting a rugby player” and she’s like “oh fuck you who the fuck do you think you are” “who am i i’m oscar pistorius the greatest legless runner that has ever been that’s who the fuck i am” “well i would rather be with a rugby player at least he is a whole man not a threequarter man like you” –  – i know  “oh fuck you” “no fuck you i’m leaving you” and then she storms out of the room and then he was like… “you fucking bitch  i hate you  you will rue the day… that you left oscar pistorius the blade runner don’t go anywhere  i hate you” that’s where he keeps his legs all right then he put the blades on “oh you’re in trouble missy i tell you i go to my gun safe” she locked herself in the bathroom he shot her through the bathroom door seems like overkill doesn’t it bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them but oscar’s one of the few men on earth that couldn’t kick the door in right he was wearing the blades so… boing ah so… i think oscar will probably go to prison now… in south africa one in four people have aids i assume it may even be worse in the prison population now can i say this look… i’ve never raped a man i hate that i have to put “a man” in that sentence but whatever i’ve never raped a man but… if i was going to rape a man it would be a legless olympian… ’cause in prison it’s all about getting one up on other people and making people think you’re tough and all that like “you want to fucking rape me i just raped an olympian bitch is that what you fucking want” there’d be a wonderful moment… when you’re in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a terminator movie  you know what i like about that joke so often when you tell a joke the rapist is the villain in the story but not in that one not in that one he’s the hero all right we have to get going soon before i leave – i thank you very much for coming –  no i said “soon” not “over” it’s just soon you cunts so calm down   i always… i always find that weird when someone like whistles like that what do they think is going to happen like i’m going to go “fucking you know me mate i was enjoying claps and cheers but what i needed was a highpitched squeal noise thank god you came along to pick up my spirits”  love you all right final story now i was in south africa again jeez i don’t think i’ll be working in south africa after this special comes out i used to do like one tour in south africa every year and i just don’t know if i’ll be invited this time they’ll be like  “we don’t like him he’s no good” anyway so i’m in south africa and i had to fly back from cape town to los angeles which is like a  flight you’ve to go up to london and go across cunt of a trip um… but it was all right ’cause i had a business class ticket so i didn’t give a fuck and when i travel economy i try to dress up nice ’cause i like to look good in case someone recognizes me and i might get an upgrade but when i’ve already got a business class ticket i try to look like a bag of shit… ’cause it’s important to me that everyone else in business class doesn’t want me there and they’re annoyed by my presence so… i’m wearing a white tshirt that’s got brown stains on it with a hole in the side i’m wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out so anyway i go up to the counter up to the business thing with the thing and i go “hello” and the lady goes  “oh mr jefferies i’m so sorry but you have been downgraded” i said “you what now” she goes “business class is full you have been downgraded” and i said “i understand that business class is full i bought one of the tickets that made it full” and she went “i’m sorry sir there’s nothing i can do” and then i just went “are you fucking kidding me” now you know when you’re dealing with customer service people and they want you to swear ’cause as soon as you swear they don’t have to engage with you anymore they can act like they’re the first adult never to hear a swear word and they can get really offended right so i went “are you fucking kidding me” and she went “please do not speak to me that way i have done nothing wrong” and i said “are you a white south african telling me you’ve done nothing wrong” anyway… tensions rose the manager comes over big fat cunt called simon fulcher right he walks over and goes  “what is wrong here what is wrong” and i said “i bought a business class ticket and i want a business class ticket” and he goes “what do you want me to do make a new chair for you there are no more seats i can’t do anything” he goes “i’ll tell you what i can do go up to the executive lounge have some peanuts enjoy a beverage listen to rodriguez and if something opens up we will move you back up to business class so i thought “there’s nothing i can do” so i walk off with my ticket i’m walking through the airport like “fucking british airways bunch of fucking cunts” right i get up to the counter and the woman behind the counter said “tickets please” and i hand over my ticket and she goes  “i’m sorry sir but this is for business class passengers only your ticket says ‘economy’ on it” and i said…  “i bought a business class ticket but you people have downgraded…” and as i was doing my little speech she looked past me and went “next”  “listen here you fucking cunt”  all right now you say “cunt” in any foreign country people lose their fucking shit security came from everywhere i was going “don’t you fucking come near me cunt” and i said “i want to speak to simon fulcher” like i’m… and they go “all right” they ring the manager up and then they go… he goes “is it the pale australian man” and the guy went “yes” he goes “we’ve had problems with him let him through” right so i go through i’m sitting there i’m eating my peanuts and i’m just angry now going “fucking british airways fucking cunts fucking…” like that and in walks in a group of americans about  of them you know the type right they all… and whenever i see americans abroad… i’ll do my impersonation of any american abroad when americans are abroad you’re just pointing out shit you see you’re just walking around going  “oh this is great look at that that’s a chair right there okay oh what’s that over there okay wonderful great” right and this group walked in and one of the women in the group went like this she went  “did anyone else see that australian guy speaking to that lady out there some people have no class” and i put my head around the pylon and i went “you can fuck off and all you don’t know what i’ve been through i’ve been downgraded” and as i said that  other people who were given the same lie that i was given that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class the penny dropped none of us are getting promoted they all lied to us and we formed an angry militia in seconds it was like a scene out of braveheart and they all stood up and went “fucking downgraded” and the woman in the group was doing this “don’t speak to me that way who the hell do you think you are” and all the men in the group were like “hey why don’t you shut the fuck up just shut the fuck up” ♪ it doesn’t matter these people seem very angry so ♪ and a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down and sometimes americans sometimes you can seem a little insincere and he came up and he went  “hey hey yeah i get it  downgraded yeah that really grinds my gears i tell you that yeah i would write a stronglyworded letter i really would” and then i thought at least this guy’s being nice and i said “look mate don’t worry about it it’s not like it’s your fault” and i said “why are you in such a big group anyway” and he goes “oh we’re in neil diamond’s band that’s neil diamond’s backup singer you just called a cunt there” and as he said that neil diamond walked around the corner like a fucking superhero… and i reacted like he was one i went “neil diamond” and neil diamond went  “hey what’s going on” and then for a second there there was a bit of my brain that thought maybe neil diamond could solve problems and i went “neil me and all these people we’ve been downgraded” and neil went “oh oh right uh well maybe that’s our fault we decided to come back a day early” “you can fuck off and all neil diamond” and then a fight breaks out amongst the neil diamond band and the downgraded punches are thrown not by me i don’t know if you have the internet but i’m not much of a fighter i’m an excellent scurrierawayer i get down “hey what have you got there hiya” anyway the airport police came three people were arrested from the downgraded… but three people were arrested from the neil diamond band and that meant that three seats

            "[rock music playing] [audience cheering] [announcer] ladies and gentlemen, welcome joe rogan. [audience cheering and applauding] what the f*ck is going on, san francisco? thanks for coming. i appreciate it! god damn! put your phone down, f*ckface! i see you, b*tch! put your phone down! motherf*ckers. they can’t use their eyes. everybody’s gotta live through their goddamn phone. whoo! i’m high as f*ck. whoo. it’s strange. i wasn’t sure if i was gonna do this sober. i’m like, “ugh…” it’s not the move. not in san francisco. this is… i love pot, but the people that are making edibles need to slow the f*ck down. oh, my god! what are you trying to do to people? i had a pot gummy bear the other day. i think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldn’t be able to steal your soul. right? how the f*ck are these people making these things, man? they’re not consistent. that’s also part of the problem. you don’t know what you’re getting, ’cause they’re not making them the same place where they make tylenol. nah, it’s some greasy dude with a grateful dead t-shirt on and a gray ponytail. he’s got a bowl of ingredients, and he can’t remember whether or not he put weed in yet. this dude’s time traveling, just back and forth. he just keeps chucking weed in there until it looks like lawn trimmings. you eat it, and it’s not what you’re looking for. it’s not regulated. you gotta ask questions. i asked a dude at the pot store. i go, “hey, man, how strong are the gummy bears?” he goes… that’s not a unit of measurement. he’s like, “el diablo. el diablo.” “f*ck, man. how much should i take?” “just the leg.” “just the leg? why are you selling whole bears? what the f*ck are you trying to prove, man?” they just watch you leave with that bear. they go, “oh, shit.” they know. they know you’re not gonna die. you’re gonna think you’re gonna die, but everybody lives. learn some shit. we learn some shit from the scary trips. see, the thing about edibles, one of the problems with it being illegal, is that a lot of us don’t have a lot of information that we could use. like, there’s a difference between smoking it and eating it. when you smoke it, you get thc. but when you eat it, it’s processed by your liver, and it produces something called 11-hydroxy metabolite that’s five times more psychoactive than thc. and it lets you talk to dolphins. [audience laughs] this is a real moment that changed my life. i was in hawaii, and we were on a boat, and we were fishing. we were pulling these lines behind the boat, and i was so high, i was trying to figure out which way the earth was spinning. like, the boat’s going this way, and the sun’s up there. i’m like, “um…” for like 20 minutes, i’m paralyzed. so, while this is all happening, these dolphins just show up. and if you’ve ever been around wild dolphins, they’re very trippy. it’s very different than you expect, because they look at you. they, like, check you out. they, like, pop out of the water and they, like, look at you… like a person, not like a f*cking deer or woodchuck. they look at you like another person. granted, i was so high i thought i was gonna die, but… i’m making eye contact with these dolphins, and i started thinking, “how smart are these f*cking things?” because we’re fishing. dolphins eat fish. but you never catch dolphins. ever. no one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin. and all i could think of while these dolphins were, like, hopping through the water, and looking at us and shit… i was thinking, “if people lived in the water, you’d f*cking catch ’em all day.” they wouldn’t even have to live in the water. if cheeseburgers just floated down geary street… at least once a week, a guy would be like, “i’m taking a chance.” and you see ’em getting yanked up to the clouds. “f*ck! we lost billy!” the bottom of his sneakers in a puff of cloud. you don’t catch dolphins on fishhooks, man. that’s weird. they’re around fishing all the time and like, “b*tch.” they’re f*cking smart. how smart? well, i watched a dolphin documentary, and it said they have a cerebral cortex that’s 40% larger than a human being’s. i don’t know what that means, but if you say it right and don’t f*ck up the words, it makes you sound smarter than you really are. i think what it means is they have big f*cking brains. but we don’t think of them as being smart ’cause they don’t do what we do. right? they don’t send e-mails. they don’t have houses. but if you lived in their world, you don’t need anything. you don’t need your fingers. no one’s typing. they have a language that’s so complex, we can’t understand it. all the food’s free. they stay where the water’s warm. i started thinking, “how f*cking smart are they? what if they’re exactly the same as us? what if it’s just some different branch of evolution? we went one way. they went the other. what if consciousness is the same?” i was thinking, “what if me to me is the same as me to a dolphin?” the way you think of yourself when you say the word “me.” i was like, “what if that’s exactly how a dolphin feels? they’re just living life through different biology, different genetics, different life experiences. but if i lived a dolphin’s life, i would be him. and if he lived my life, he would be me.” and then i started thinking, “what if that’s the case with people? what if everyone is exactly the same? we’re just living life through different bodies. what if that’s the secret of happiness? treat everyone as if it’s you living another life.” [audience cheering and applauding] i mean… and then i thought, “god damn, how good is this weed i’m getting in california? whoo! i’m on a f*cking floating craft out in the middle of the ocean, talking to water people.” the problem with treating everybody as if it’s you living another life is you wanna f*cking smack yourself. half the people you meet, you just wanna f*cking smack ’em. we live in the weirdest time ever. i mean, it’s the most awesome time ever. but it’s the weirdest time ever, too. we’re, like, that close to president trump. [man 2] no. boo! “no. boo!” you boo, but you won’t vote, you f*cks! all those bernie sanders people, “yo, bernie’s the shit.” “did you vote for him?” “voting ain’t real, bro. it doesn’t even work, dude.” we are that close to president trump. bill cosby’s a rapist, and bruce jenner’s a chick. we’re in an episode of lost. down is up and up is down! this is the type of world you get when you give kids participation trophies for getting their ass kicked in soccer games. this is the world we get! we get a goddamn nerfed-up world filled with nonsense. nobody wants to be president. nobody. i hope hillary wins. that way we can realize chicks can’t do that f*cking job either. it’s a stupid job. it’s a stupid job invented back when people used to write with feathers. it’s dumb! it’s just some old-school shit that we need to get rid of. it doesn’t make any sense. being president is great if there’s like 50 people. if there’s 50 people, you can figure out which one’s the best. three hundred million people? i have three kids. i don’t know where the f*ck they are right now. how is this one dude in charge of 300 million people? it’s nonsense. it’s so old and stupid. they make this guy sleep in this f*cking white house. if trump wins, you know his house is cooler than the white house. he’s like, “i’m not sleeping in that shitty-ass, stupid house.” trump’s probably got, like, a tube at home that he opens up, and a chinese girl just pops out of it, and sucks his dick and goes right back in. that’s what i would do if i had that kind of money. we’re down to assholes! where’s elon musk when you need him? where’s the f*cking geniuses? where’s mark cuban? no. we got an old lady trying to get back at her husband for a blowjob he got in the ’90s. we got an old man who hates money. and we got a reality tv star with a plastic set of hair. you can’t have a president with environmental concerns, when every time this motherf*cker does his hair, we lose a foot of ozone layer and a polar bear bursts into flames. he’s got, like, a closet full of aqua net at home. you can’t pretend you don’t give a f*ck when you have that thing going on, dude. stop that. the white house got broken into while obama was in office. the first time in over 100 years that someone broke into the white house. also, the first time a girl was guarding the front door by herself. “what are you trying to say, that women can’t do everything men can do?” exactly. that’s exactly what i’m saying. that seems sexist, right? people say, “you’re sexist.” no, it’s not sexist. here’s why it’s not sexist. ‘cause men can’t even do everything men can do. see? there’s no physical equality, folks. that’s why we have the olympics. ‘cause there’s people that can do some shit that you and i can’t do. one of those things is guarding the f*cking white house. i know i can’t guard the white house. you know how i know? because i’ve met shaquille o’neal and his dick is where my face is. that’s not equality. that’s not white privilege. listen, if the white house is experiencing a shaq attack, i’m the wrong dude to save the world. i did fear factor with shaq. if we’re holding hands, it’d be like a six-year-old at the park with his dad. we’re barely the same thing. so, do i think women should guard the white house? no. i don’t think i should, either. it’s not sexist to say that women can’t do big physical labor things as good as giant men can. but people will tell you it is. well, i’m not sexist. as a matter of fact, my favorite people are all female. i have a wife and i have three daughters. they’re my favorite people in the world. but i could beat the f*ck out of all of them. okay? listen… if they’re guarding the door, i’m getting in. i don’t mean to sound cocky. but i’m just real confident. i could f*ck them up if i had the flu. okay? yeah, we’re different. we’re different. i could beat up my cat, too. i’m not proud of it. i just tell you what’s up. if you wanna bet money, bet money on me. i’ll f*ck that cat up. most likely. cats are f*cking weird like that, man. i was petting my cat once and he bit me. i was like, “whoa! are we gonna do this? what the f*ck are you doing here?” i got a little nervous. got a little nervous. “women can do everything men can do. this guy’s a piece of shit. we’re leaving. too much information is going in that i don’t agree with!” “what the guy said was total bullshit. total bullshit.” how’d that girl get that job? i’ll tell you how that girl got that job. because someone let her have that job. which means, either there were a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her… or her boss was a chick and she hated her. either one’s possible. look, if there was a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her, that makes total sense. if there’s one hot girl and she’s working with five guys in an office, no work’s getting done in that office. that office is now just an audition to see which guy gets to f*ck her. each one of those guys will just slowly start to morph to figure out what this girl likes. men become like an octopus that tries to fit its way through a keyhole. “there’s gotta be a f*cking way. there’s gotta be a f*cking way!” you got this girl who’s like, “i could guard the front door.” “oh, you could definitely guard the door. no doubt. no doubt.” and over time, if this woman doesn’t sleep with one of these men and claim him, over time, these guys will just start morphing. and they’ll just start saying ridiculous, preposterous shit. “debbie wants to guard the front door. do you have a problem with that?” “no, i don’t. as a matter of fact, i think women are amazing. plus, i’m vegan.” and they will just… they will wear patchouli. they will do what the f*ck they have to do. next thing you know, poor f*cking debbie at the front door… “why am i alone?” [chuckles] the whole story is so bananas. and it’s one of my favorite stories. so i’m gonna give you the whole story of the break-in at the white house with no edits and no comic exaggerations. this is the real story. ‘cause a lot of people think there’s some grand conspiracy. there’s some cabal of evil geniuses that’s pulling the strings on everyone in america. it’s most likely that people are just dumb as f*ck, in all sorts of walks of life. this is the story. this is the real story about the person who broke into the white house. first of all, people are always worried, “the government’s checking out my e-mails, bro. the government’s watching us all the time.” they pulled this guy over two months before he broke into the white house. he had four handguns, two rifles and a machete with him. they didn’t even watch him. he had a map. on the map was washington, and it had an “x” where the white house is. they’re like, “you’re good to go.” they let him go! two months later, this motherf*cker broke into the white house. and why did he break into the white house? why do you break into the white house ever? because you want to die. you don’t… that’s like a suicide run. that’s the only reason why someone runs toward the white house. if you had to ask someone, “what kind of security do you think they have at the white house?” “oh, dude… they got snipers on every corner. they got lasers in the grass. if you get too far, they open up a door, you drop right into jail.” nope. turns out they don’t even have a dog. you just f*cking run. the guy who made it into the white house, he had 800 rounds of ammunition in his car. left that there. took a knife. that’s a guy who wants to die! he’s just sitting in his f*cking car going, “f*ck the government! f*ck my ex-wife! and f*ck everybody! i’m gonna do this! f*ck you!” just sprinting, “oh, my god, i’m doing it! oh, my god, i’m doing it!” thinking, with every step, “this is gonna be the last step of my life. no, this is gonna be the last step of my life. no, this…” and he gets to the front door. it’s unlocked! he opens it. there’s a girl there by herself. smacks her to the ground and just starts running through the hall. ah! he’s probably going, “why am i alive?” he’s probably thinking… he was inside for minutes. for minutes, running around. he got tackled by an off-duty officer. he was probably thinking, “i wanted to die. i don’t want to go to f*cking jail. will somebody please shoot me?” then he was probably pissed. “where are my tax dollars going? what kind of security are you f*cking people running in this place?” [chuckles]\n",
            "imagine when obama found out a girl was guarding him. he was probably like, “everybody, everybody, not that much diversity. i mean, what, are you playing f*cking fairy tale games here?” obama’s got a hard job, ’cause he’s the first president that’s ever been around while google was here. you know, he could google his own name if he gets crazy in the middle of the night. right? “so, let me see what the people have to say.” he’d just go, “obama is a…” [groans] “i’m none of those f*cking things.” freakin’ out. shit. [sighs] probably thinking, “why the f*ck did i do this?” i think the guy who broke into the white house and obama probably have a lot in common. in that… they went for it, but they probably never really thought they were getting in there. you can’t quit once you’re the president. the moment obama actually got into office, like, “good morning, mr. president,” he was probably like, “oh, no! what the f*ck did i do this for? i didn’t think i was actually gonna get in. [sighs] i can’t sleep. i’m freaking out. everybody wants to kill me. [exhales heavily] who the f*ck is guarding me?” looks out in the hallway. there’s a girl taking selfies. that’d be the greatest selfie of all time. a girl with her ass out, duck lips, in the background, a dude’s breaking into the white house. [laughs] you know i’m not making this up. you’ve all seen this. this is recognizable. pigeon-toed is a good move ’cause you can’t get away that good. you just, like… like there’s something wrong with your back. that’s a recognizable pose. when did that start? ‘cause if you look at the original pictures back when people first invented pictures, everybody just stood there looking hungry. like, if you saw a photo from the 1800s, and in the background a girl was going… she’s a f*cking time traveler! nobody knew that move back then. somebody had to see their face. “oh, people like that. they like what i’m doing.” combo. a two-hole combo attractor. it’s all over online! it gets you a lot of likes. i saw a gal on instagram, she has eight million followers. all she does is take pictures of her ass. that’s it. she’s got a winning formula. she sticks with it. no witty memes. there’s no inspirational quotes. mnh-mnh. mnh-mnh. just a lot of this. different ways. and she’s just a regular girl, man. i’m watching this, i’m like, “this is a different kind of person.” she has eight million people that have no idea what her voice sounds like. she doesn’t have a job that they like. she doesn’t have an occupation that they follow. they’re just staring at her ass. this is a new kind of human. there’s never been a person, psychologically, that’s had to navigate those kind of waters. if you really stop and think about it, science should really step in and start looking at this. don’t go to south america to study some new frog that nobody gives a f*ck about. there’s a girl in florida with eight million people staring at her ass. how does this girl keep a relationship? what is her day like? how many dick pics does she get sent? how many dick pics does that girl receive on a daily basis? is it like the national debt counter was just f*cking spinning out of control constantly? i bet if she turns on the notifications, her phone just starts screaming and runs away from her. i bet if she deletes all the dick pics from her phone, it would be physically lighter. this is a new kind of person. we really have to understand, there’s never been a person like this before. and she’s just a person. like, that kind of influence, that kind of attractant, that’s a very strong drug to have in the hands of just a girl. and as a guy who has daughters, i just think of that, like, that’s kind of f*cking… that’s weird. because this girl has eight million people staring at her ass. eight million creeps and weirdos and perverts objectifying her. i mean, i follow her, but i’m not like those other assholes. i’m different. i care. i care about who she is. i’m a nice person. i’m a hero or something. [laughs] “i’m different. those other guys are assholes. men are noble. men are noble and true.” mmm. if we get to come. if men don’t get to come, we get real sméagol-like real quick. just a few months of no dates, [imitating gollum] “mesus is just so disappointed with all the mens mesus meets. mesus is so embarrassed at how other mens talks to you. mmm. oh.” everyone wants to set themselves up as being the noble one. everybody wants to be matthew mcconaughey, to save the world on a rocket ship. there’s people that are signing up to go to mars. do you know about this? there’s a mission to mars, a manned mission to mars, where 200,000 people have signed up to be amongst the four people to die on mars. they’re gonna take a one-way trip to mars. that’s some sad shit for a bunch of reasons. first of all, it’s some sad shit, ’cause that’s 200,000 people that don’t have any real friends. right? if it’s someone you love, your real friend… if one of my friends is gonna move to florida, i’ll be like, “b*tch, where the f*ck are you going? you’re gonna go to florida? we can’t hang out if you go to florida. why the f*ck are you moving to florida, man?” but you might be able to deal with it. “we can just visit each other every now and then.” but if your friend was gonna move to mars, you’d be like, “oh, really? get in the f*cking car! just get in the car, dude.” take him out to death valley, “look around! sucks, right? mars sucks worse. get back in the car, stupid.” jesus christ! there’s places in america you can’t live, man. you don’t wanna live in detroit, why the f*ck are you talking about moving to mars? people really consider moving to mars. it’s one of the dumbest ideas ever. but if you say that, people will eco-bro you. have you ever been eco-broed? these people will find an opportunity to virtue signal over you, as michael shermer likes to point out. like, puff their chest out and say that they’re probably better than you. “hey, dude. seriously? you think there’s something wrong with going to mars? well, i don’t know if you’ve paid attention, man. we maybe should colonize mars ’cause california’s almost out of water.” then he’ll nod, like, “yeah, b*tch.” we’re right next to the ocean. what the f*ck are you talking about? look at all that water. you fly over it, it takes a day. the world’s blue. it’s more water than it is not water. we have a salt problem. we don’t have a water problem. suck the salt out of the water, we got a goddamn party. instead of pissing and moaning… “too complicated, bro. we gotta go to neptune.” oh, my god! you’re f*cking crazy. we’re a crazy race filled with crazy people. we’re like a dude with a dirty house. like, “man, i gotta build a new house.” no, you gotta stop shitting in your kitchen. stop piling up newspapers you’re never gonna read in front of your bathroom, you f*ck! we’re crazy! one-way trip to mars. a one-way trip in coach with three other people so f*cking stupid, they’re willing to die on mars with you. great. what great conversation you’re gonna have. it’s nonsense, folks. my friend was like, “they’re not gonna die on mars, man. if people are smart enough to figure out how to get to mars, they’re smart enough to figure out how to get back.” here’s why that doesn’t make any sense. people smart enough to get to mars aren’t going. see, that’s the dirty secret about rocket travel, ladies and gentlemen. nobody smart enough to make a rocket ever gets in one of those f*cking things. no. no, they look at each other right before the launch and they go… they talk german and they get behind giant f*cking concrete bunkers. they take some square-jawed, corn-fed dude from the middle of the country, tuck a bible under that dude’s arm and strap him into that giant metal dick, and shoot it off into the heavens. that’s what we do. and that is what that is. that is a metal dick. it’s a robot dick, and we’re trying to f*ck the sky. we are literally trying to come people out of the tip of a metal dick onto other planets. our ultimate goal is that we get those planets pregnant, and they’re too filled up with people, and then they gotta make a new metal dick. “bro, we gotta go to jupiter.” then they make another one. they shoot that f*cking thing, and they fill jupiter up. we just keep filling the cosmos up with people. and we never evolve. and we never change. we stay perfect, like we are right now. who’s in? you’re gonna all come with me. we’re gonna leave here right now and go to the church of scientology right down the street, and it’s all gonna make sense when you find out that you are an eternal being that created reality so that you can enjoy it. i watched that hbo documentary a couple too many times. i went clear, i think. i think i’m clear. i’m back! i’m back now. if you haven’t seen… [chuckles] i had to watch going clear, a scientology documentary, ’cause i have a neighbor who’s a scientologist, and i don’t even think he’s gay. i don’t know what the f*ck’s going on. [exhales heavily] but he sleeps really close to me, you know. like, my bed’s here, this f*cking dude’s bed’s, like, over there. his house is… i mean, if you take away the walls, he’s f*cking right there. it’s like, “what does this crazy f*ck believe?” and scientology is a wonderful religion. not just because it was written by a science fiction author who wrote more fake shit than anyone that’s ever walked the face of the earth. and not by a small amount. this dude never made a second draft in his f*cking life. everything was one draft of nonsense. and he wrote more of it than anybody. not in his neighborhood, not in his state, not in a year, not in a decade. more than anyone that’s ever lived, ever. and scientology is still like, “i don’t see any red flags. i think we’re good. i think this is legit as f*ck.” if scientology is a good religion, it’s because other religions get to make fun of ’em. it’s like it’s the one religion that even the mormons are like, “b*tch, you believe what? hold on. i mean, at least we don’t have video of joseph smith. there’s some f*cking shitty black and white footage of l. ron hubbard with a captain’s outfit on. you wanna explain that? [chuckles] why does he have all those awards on? why is tom cruise wearing a gold medal the size of a dinner plate? what the f*ck is going on with you people?” i watched it with my mom, and it was like… first of all, scientology, they don’t pay taxes. that’s disturbing. they’re tax-free, which means they’re a recognized religion by the government of the united states. which means the government of the united states had to go over what they believe and went, “everything seems in order. none of this shit seems like a cult.” well, what the f*ck is a cult, and what’s a religion? so i had to look it up. turns out… i don’t know who wrote this, but it’s a perfect definition. a cult is bullshit. it’s created by one person. that person knows it’s bullshit. in a religion, that dude’s dead. so it’s a religion ’cause l. ron hubbard’s dead. so i guess they got it on a loophole. i watched it with my mom, and my mom was like, “i can’t believe anybody would fall for that.” “you made me go to catholic school. the f*ck are you talking about? there was a child molester dressed like a sorcerer sitting on a golden throne, and you made me call him father. slow your roll, lady.” imagine if i talked to my mom like that. oh, my god. jokes, folks. just jokes. i don’t have a problem with people being religious because i just think life itself is too open-ended. it’s too confusing. and i think we’re evolving. and part of our struggle in evolving is unanswered questions. we wanna seek these answers. but in the meanwhile, they just give you so much anxiety, and it f*cks with you so much. there’s nothing wrong with joining a cult. i think you gotta just join a nice, friendly one. like, the mormons are a good cult. here’s why. they don’t get mad at anybody. like, they never kill anybody. like, here’s a perfect example. matt stone and trey parker, the guys who created south park, they made a hilarious musical called the book of mormon. it’s fantastic. if you haven’t seen it, it’s so f*cking hilarious. but it’s also brutal! brutal about the mormons. you know what the mormons did? they went to see it, and they took out a full-page ad in the playbill. it said, “if you enjoyed this musical and you wanna find out more about being a mormon, please visit our website.” they just took it right on the chin like champs. they didn’t get mad. they didn’t get defensive. they didn’t kill anybody. that’s a good cult. they just said, “what do you wanna do?” “we got nine wives. shut the f*ck up!” “everybody just… everybody, just chill. just chill.” that’s a good religion. that’s a good cult. some cults aren’t that good. they get f*cking testy. you know the one. we don’t have to say who. you know what i’m talking about. there’s that one that will kill you if you draw their guy. “come on, man. i can’t even draw your dude? what if i draw a dude drawing your dude?” “no loopholes!” “f*ckin’ relax, bro.” and this isn’t just theoretical. people have died ’cause they made cartoons. before the most recent paris attacks, there was a magazine called charlie hebdo, and they were attacked, where 11 cartoonists were killed. eleven more were wounded, and they killed a cop, too. f*cking crazy! over cartoons! and when you… when there’s radical, crazy people in the world, what’s interesting is the reaction to radical, crazy people and how everything just sort of kind of balances itself out when things get weird. because when these people got killed over a cartoon, the whole world was in shock. the whole world was outraged. but one of the scariest things about it was nobody wanted to print those pictures. you couldn’t see ’em in the la times. you couldn’t find them in time magazine. you had to go online and find them. it was a dark moment for free speech, because everybody’s like, “oh. i don’t wanna get killed. i don’t wanna show the pictures.” it was weird, until… the balance. because after they got killed and nobody wanted to print the pictures, word got back to texas… where they promptly held a “draw muhammad” contest in garland, texas. i’m not making a word of this up. you can google it, and i’ll wait. they had a “draw muhammad” contest in garland, texas. two dudes showed up, started shooting at the building. they were killed almost instantly. why? because they were at a “draw muhammad” contest in texas. how obvious does a trap have to be before you start getting suspicious? what, are you livin’ in a wile e. coyote cartoon, motherf*cker? you ever go to texas? that’s not santa monica, b*tch. that’s a totally different kind of white people. those are some wild west people that have computers and modern guns. they’re not supposed to be there. people didn’t evolve in texas. it’s not like they were monkeys, then they became people and they stayed in that spot. no. no, they landed on boats on the east coast. the stubborn ones stayed. the smart ones made it to california. but along the way, we lost a bunch of people. [audience laughs] and some of them just stuck around. “y’all go ahead. we’re gonna hang back here. i’m gonna draw the biggest dick the world’s ever seen in the sand. my wife’s got the biggest titties. i’mma try to f*ck a snake. i think it can be done.” they just stayed. they just gathered cattle, stockpiled ammo. and they all talk alike. and that’s why you gotta be nervous. you gotta be nervous in places with accents, okay? it’s one of the reasons why i can prove that california is the best spot to live. ‘cause all the spots that suck, they all have to sound like each other. ‘cause i grew up in a place like that. i grew up in boston. it’s not that the people in boston suck, but the weather sucks. it’s f*cking horrible. and in the winter everybody gets in their car in the morning, and just goes, “f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck! f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck!” and everybody’s worried about… it’s a real possibility you might starve to death one day. you might freeze trying to walk home. [imitates boston accent] so they all talk in the same way. “oh, my god. how many more months till summer? ahhh! when is this f*cking winter gonna be over? we need more firewood.” [whines] they have to sound like the people around them. so if other people invade, like, “we stick together. we’re all in this together.” that’s how they are in texas, too. they’re like, “y’all ain’t from around here, are ya?” they have a f*cking certain way of talking. which is proof positive why california is the best spot. try making fun of a california accent. what are you gonna do? speak clear and concise? what are you gonna do? you gonna mock us? you’re gonna say some shit that everybody understands? they’re not supposed to be in texas, folks. it’s not even a state. it’s a republic. they were like, “man, we ain’t so sure about this whole united states thing. we’re gonna hang back. hang back, see how this plays out.” they don’t have any rules. they have like three pages of rule books. here’s how i know this. i’m gonna tell you a fact, a fact about texas that will change the way you think about texas. there are more tigers in captivity in texas, in private collections, than there are in all of the wild of the world. i’m gonna repeat it because i know you’re like, “oh, the fear factor guy is just making shit up to make his jokes work.” no. there’s more tigers in dudes’ yards in texas than the rest of the f*cking planet! how is that possible? because they can. because they went through the rule book… [mumbles] “it don’t say shit about tigers. order it up, dude. order it up, dude!” one guy got a tiger, and his neighbor’s like, “shit, i didn’t know we could get tigers.” and he got two tigers. and the first guy was like, “i ain’t about to let this faggot out-tiger me.” and he opened up tiger world with his oil money. we’re gonna need those people, folks, if the russians invade. we can’t make f*cking warrior babies with those chicks in marin county with fake asses and rubber lips, okay? we’re gonna need some real warrior genes. we’re gonna need some women who wear non-ironic daisy dukes. they got cowboy boots with no socks and stinky feet. and they yell out, “chris kyle, rest in peace,” when you make ’em come. we need those women! if the russians come, we gotta be ready. think about the children. think about the children while i get a sip. this is super important, ladies and gentlemen. a lot of people are sleeping on… [laughs] imagine if i had real points. oh, jesus christ. [audience cheering] i love you f*ckers, too, man. so excited to be here. [sighs] i have kids and i lie to them. i get high around ’em, too. people say you shouldn’t do that, but they don’t see it. they say you shouldn’t be intoxicated around your children. well, i’m not. i’m high. i call it “elevated.” it’s a different thing. the people who have a problem with that, they don’t understand what getting high is. like, they think you’re gonna be to your kid, like, “who are you?” what do you think? what’s the worst thing that can happen if i’m a little high around my kid? they’re gonna get extra hugs, and daddy’s going to be paranoid about objects. “look out. don’t go there.” that’s it. plus, i have cool conversations. i have a six-year-old daughter, man. there’s not a lot of 48-year-old man and 6-year-old girl have in common, other than the fact she’s my daughter. and so, our conversations are normally pretty boring. but when i’m high, i’m like, “you know, you call that thing your baby, your doll. you call it your baby, but you know it’s not a baby, right?” “yeah, i know it’s not a baby.” “do you call it a baby because you’re the youngest and you like having someone who is responsible for you?” “maybe.” “okay. that’s cool. that’s cool. give me a hug. i love you.” [kisses] it’s weird, man. it’s weird raising little people. there’s some things that i didn’t expect. one of the things i didn’t expect is you have to lie to them. like, you don’t have to lie to them about a lot of things, but you have to lie to them about santa claus. it’s just one of those things, man, ’cause it’s like a community. you have to think about what your kid’s gonna tell other kids. because when it comes to santa claus, you don’t want your kid to be one of two things. you don’t want your kid to be the first kid that tells everyone that santa claus is bullshit, ’cause that kid’s an asshole. but you don’t want your kid to be the last kid that figures out that santa claus is bullshit, ’cause that kid’s a moron. so you got… you got a little bit of… you’re like, “oh, no. when do we do this? when do we do this?” and no one knows when to do it. you just let the kids figure it out. then they’re like, “dad, what the f*ck?” you’re like, “aw… oh, i missed the boat. i missed the boat.” nobody knows when to do it. nobody can be honest about it. they have little meetings and shit. and i’m like, “when do we tell ’em?” this lady goes, “when they’re 11.” they’re gonna be f*cking by then. i told her it was funny. she didn’t believe me. i’m like, “oh, i’m sorry. i’m off by a year.” that’s not as funny, but it’s… i didn’t mean it. but it’s this thing. they want to keep the kids in the dark. and they wanna pretend they’re the only one that’s teaching the kid. this is a weird thing that people do. they’re like, “i teach my kids, man. i teach my kids.” “eh… when you see ’em.” but unless you’re some freak who homeschools your children in the forest, your kid’s gonna go to school. they’re gonna go to school, and they’re gonna be in a class with 50 other kids. the teacher only makes 20 bucks a year, and she’s thinking about dick. that’s all she’s thinking about. she’s thinking about getting stuffed. she’s a young, fertile woman who loves kids. and she’s writing on that chalkboard. and the kids all huddle up and share information. like, “yeah, what did your dad tell you? your dad tell you that, yeah? my dad says santa claus is f*cking bullshit, okay? you ever go near a chimney? it’s that big. what the f*ck? teacher’s coming. play with blocks. act stupid. uh, how does this work?” they play dumb. they play dumb! they’re like little prisoners, trying to figure their way out. they make little papier-mâché heads and pretend they’re napping. they’re little humans. they wanna run shit. “who is these people telling us what to do? are they being straight with us, man? what the f*ck is going on?” i knew the day my daughter knew that santa claus is bullshit. she came home, stared me down. she was, like, mad-dogging me. she took her book bag, and just goes… [scoffs] walked right up to the chimney, looking at me. “how the f*ck?” “dad, have you ever met santa claus?” “no, honey, i’ve never met him.” “but you let him in the house?” and there’s this moment… it was a moment where a seven-year-old has you at checkmate. you’re like, “oh, shit.” i don’t know whether to high-five her or to keep lying. you wanna go, “yeah, you got me. you got me. you got me. that’s bullshit. no, the big bang is real, but this is bullshit.” the big bang sounds even less real. the problem is, you have to be consistent. if you’re teaching your kids nonsense, you gotta teach ’em only nonsense. you can’t mix nonsense in with, like, real stuff. like, my daughter will go like, “how do birds fly?” i go, “birds have bones that are hollow, so they’re really light. then they have feathers, which cover a large surface area. and they use the hollow bones and the feathers to push down on the air. see, the air looks like it’s nothing, right? but it’s actually a bunch of gases. that’s why the trees move when the wind blows. the birds can manipulate that and go through 3-d space.” “whoa!” “yeah, nature is crazy.” “yeah. how does the fat man get through the little hole?” “magic! christmas magic! now go to bed. i’m trying to f*ck your mom! go to bed!” [audience laughing] jokes, folks. just jokes. can’t talk like that. that’s how you make strippers. you gotta be nice. they’re little, tiny people. they’re adorable. they don’t know anything yet. you gotta teach ’em everything. you can’t talk mean. [inhales sharply] kids are a lot like really f*cking stupid people… in that if you get ten really stupid people in a room, the most confident one just starts running shit. they don’t have to have any more information, they just have to be more confident. if you get a bunch of dummies together, they’re like, “i don’t know what’s going on.” “i don’t know what’s going on.” “i f*cking do. i f*cking do.” the guy doesn’t have to have any extra data, he just has to be the only one that’s confident. and that’s what it’s like in school. my daughter’s class has this f*cking kid named debbie. and every day it’s, “debbie says…” oh, f*cking debbie says. debbie says what? you don’t think about that before you have kids. not only are you gonna have kids, but your kids are gonna make friends, and then you have to make friends with the f*cking parents of your kids. and some of ’em are crazy. my daughter’s like, “debbie says adam and eve are the only two people in the world, and all people came from them. is that true?” [sighs] and this is weird. like, you don’t know what to do, right? you want to be diplomatic. you don’t want to cause problems at school. but you gotta be honest. and one of the most difficult things to say to a kid is, “i don’t know.” i’m like, “sweetie, i don’t know. i don’t know if adam and eve is where people came from. but nobody knows, because no one from today is alive back then. so it’s not something you can measure. so it’s not something you can see. so we don’t know. but here’s what we do know. you know how some people have big ears and some people have little ears?” “yeah.” “well, some people have brains that are made out of dog shit. and they get horny, too. and what happens is, they have to find someone even dumber than them to have sex with. it’s like the opposite of evolution. and then they have a kid, and their kid is f*cked. their kid is f*cked! and everybody wants to pretend it’s a level playing field. there’s no level, anywhere you look. is an eagle and a salmon level? does the salmon ever get to eat the eagle? no. the universe does not want even! it wants conflict and resolution and constant improvement. okay? i’m gonna shut this light out, and i’m gonna go f*ck your mom right in the mouth. all right?” i don’t say these things. i don’t say any of these things! i was like, “i don’t know. maybe debbie’s right. doesn’t make sense to me. how would that work?” “how would that work?” “it wouldn’t work, would it?” adam and eve are the only two people. they have kids. and then, where do all the other people come from? i guess the kids just start f*cking each other. is that what happens? mom f*cks the kids, or the… yeah, exactly. debbie’s parents. they were at my house, man, for a cookout, and the dude told me the earth’s 10,000 years old. they’re young earth christians. they’re sweet people, by the way. before i shit on them… i’m gonna shit on them, but before i shit on them, they’re sweet. they’re really nice people. i hug ’em every time i see ’em. they’re really kind, nice people. but they just found a part of their brain, they’re like, “i have no use for this.” [grunts] chucked that whole logic, discerning-reason part. “this f*cking thing’s confusing.” they’re young earth christians, which means they follow the strictest interpretation of the bible possible. i’m like, “how many people believe the earth is less than 10,000 years old?” uh! i looked it up. there’s a recent gallup poll that said that 46% of america believes the earth is less than 10,000 years old. [audience booing] here’s why you shouldn’t be scared. they can only measure people dumb enough to answer polls. and when you factor that in, you’re talking about a really small number. ‘cause you know what the average response is if you call people up and say, “how old’s the earth?” number one answer is, “older than your mother’s pussy.” and then they hang up. number two answer is, “f*ck you!” after that, you start throwing numbers around. and only 46% of those dummies were stupid enough to think the earth is 10,000 years old. that’s debbie’s f*cking parents. so out of the people that answer polls… is it even 1%? it might be 1%. only 46% are that f*cking stupid. and that’s the 1% we should really be worried about. we’re worried about the wrong 1%. not that we shouldn’t be worried about the really rich, greedy people. we definitely should. we should definitely worry about bankers and people who… they’re just stockpiling resources. they could help the world in some really impossible ways for anybody else. but they don’t. they’d rather just pile up their gold. [grunts] yeah, that 1% is awful. but there’s another 1% that freaks me the f*ck out that no one’s talking about. that’s the 1% who leave comments on youtube videos. who the f*ck are those freaks? could you imagine people talking to each other like that in real life and not beating the shit out of each other? i mean, if jesus christ himself came back from the dead and had a youtube page, the first comment would be, “you ain’t shit without your dad, pussy.” these are monsters. this is not a normal person’s response. normal people don’t leave comments. what a normal person does, they watch a video. they like it or they don’t like it. that’s it. it ends right there. but what you’re dealing with is the process of racism, and child abuse, and neglect and shitty genes. and the insane clown posse is playing. they know all the words, and they’re wafting up their farts, and their cheez doodle fingers. and like, “an open letter to jennifer lopez… let me pause and just jerk off in my shirt real quick, here. [mimics fart] ugh… dear, jennifer, don’t you think it’s about time you dress a little more classy? what are your children gonna see when they see…” just f*cking think of the meanest, most biting shit that’s gonna cut it. as if jennifer lopez has time in between eating diamonds and f*cking all her background dancers in a castle that she built with her ass. but you know, “let me check the youtube comments to see if my self-esteem’s on point. oh!” and you know who’s dumber than them? me. ‘cause i read their shit and i get mad. i know they’re stupid. i still get upset. f*ck! this is the world, folks. this is the world we’re living in. are we happy? i’m not sure. is this what we wanted? i don’t know. [woman] no! no. [woman] no! are you sure? [woman] no! why are you doing this? what is this? what are you doing? are you fighting for freedom? what’s happening? [woman 2] no! are you white panthers? what is this? [man] life sucks! what are you saying? [man] life can kind of suck sometimes. life can kind of suck? maybe it’s how you’re livin’ it, b*tch. “life can kind of suck.” it’s the greatest time ever to be alive. “yeah, i’d live in the old days when you could die from crabs.” it doesn’t get any better than today, man. so stupid. “make america great again.” it’s as good as it’s ever been. what the f*ck are you saying? we have 4g everywhere. when has it been better? we have netflix. when has it been better? come on, man. stop. it’s never been better. this is as good as it’s ever been. it’s just weird. it’s just weird. you gotta get your shit together, b*tch. don’t blame the world. god damn it. damn it, man. and listen, if you’ve seen any of this show, and you said, “i think some of the stuff you’re saying is really funny, but i sense a lot of, like, macho posturing from you. i sense a lot of, like, bullshit, tough-guy stuff.” you’re totally correct. and what it is is i live with all women, okay? and i’m becoming more of a b*tch every day of my life. and i just wanna say i’m not unhappy. i’ve never been more happy in my life. this is the happiest i’ve ever been. but when you’re with all girls, like, you have all girls all the time, you have to make little compromises. you don’t think about it while it’s happening. it’s like the rock doesn’t think about the water carving a path through it, but eventually, that f*cking path is gonna get deep. and when you’re with all people that are different than you, they just go, “hmm…” they just start looking at you like little raptors testing the fence. [squawks] they’ll just start poking at you. it’s what people do. it’s natural. it’s just what people do. if you live with people that all are on at&t and you’re on verizon, they’re like, “dude, look at my bars. make the switch. come on over. what are you, a f*cking democrat, dude? libertarian is where it’s at. wake up! join us!” when you’re with all girls, they just start… they constantly f*ck with my manhood. it’s like, i’ll come home and some new thing is painted pink. i’m like, “why is this pink?” “it looks better pink, daddy.” “it looks better pink, daddy.” and my wife’s like, “i think they’re right.” i’m like, “oh… i see what the f*ck is going on here. it’s mutiny!” they just chip, chip, chip away. it’s like if my manhood was a mountain of marbles. every day they steal two. they just walk up to my stack… you can’t say shit. you can’t say shit, ’cause it’s only two marbles, and you’re like, “i still got all these marbles. everything is gonna be okay. i’ll deal with this eventually.” but you’re not gonna deal with it. every day, two more marbles. you never get those marbles back. you see it comin’. you don’t do anything about it. you’re like, “i gotta go to sleep. all right, everybody stop crying. i gotta go to sleep.” and men don’t want to admit that. “not me, bro. not me, bro. i’d rather just live in the woods by myself.” what are you, a f*cking coldplay song? huh? what are you, a character in a book, you piece of shit? no one’s honest. no one’s honest about how much we need other people. that’s why the characters that we adore so much in the movies are the people that don’t need people. the people who just walk away from it all, like, “wow, what a rebel!” but in real life, we need people so bad that the worst shit you can do to a prisoner is put them in solitary confinement. so think about that. you’re in a cement box filled with rapists and murderers. and the worst shit they can do is leave you alone. we’re f*cking weird. we are weird, ’cause what we are really is we’re some weird superorganism that, like, needs each other in some sort of strange way. but we’re all in denial. “i’m kind of a loner.” oh, shut the f*ck up. there’s no such thing. it’s not real. every person in this room, me included, all of us, we are all a calculation. we’re all an ongoing, on-running calculation of all the interactions you’ve ever had with all the people that you’ve ever met. and you do a bunch of things that people like, and start doing more of that. you’re like, “i’ll do more of that.” you find things that people don’t like, you’re like, “i’ll keep that shit to myself, hmm. i don’t like that feeling. hmm.” that’s what we do. that’s what we do. it’s weird. we don’t want to admit it. but that’s who we all are. and i’m just telling you this because i’ve never been more of a b*tch. right now, i have slowly but surely bent until i’m in this position. this is how i’m riding out my days, just like this. “okay, okay, okay, okay.” but i’m also telling you right now that i’m not going out like bruce jenner. oh! that’s right, politically correct san francisco. here’s my take on this bruce jenner thing. and, you know, everybody has their own… not really. this is what everybody’s take is. this is the take that you’re supposed to have. “he’s always been a woman trapped in a man’s body.” maybe. definitely maybe. definitely people are like that. definitely, there are people who were born in the wrong gender. and am i saying they should stay their gender? no. who gives a f*ck? you should do whatever you wanna do. you should be happy. you should be free. i don’t care what you do. but… it’s also possible that, maybe, if you live with crazy b*tches long enough, you become one. that’s all i’m saying. i don’t see this discussed. it is entirely possible. if you put a praying mantis on a leaf, it becomes the color of the leaf. why? because it wants to live. it wants to survive. it wants to be accepted by its environment. you show me a man who’s lived with the kardashians for ten years who didn’t come out a chick, and then we’ll have some data, okay? ‘cause right now, we lost a f*cking american olympian, and i want you to have some respect! we’re down bruce jenner. and i’ve got a close eye on kanye west, and i don’t exactly like what i’m seeing. [audience applauding and cheering] look at kanye west. he’s a very talented, young, heterosexual man who starts a clothing line… he’s clearly jealous about taylor swift, and he tweets like a coked-up stripper in the middle of the night. you don’t see what i’m seeing? we are watching the plot of a f*cking stephen king book play out! an american athletic hero moves in with a woman who’s made hundreds of millions of dollars through no way anyone can explain to anyone. he breaks up with her. she turns him into a chick. the whole world tells him he’s beautiful. you tell me you don’t see what i’m seeing? you have to say… you have to say she’s beautiful. “she’s beautiful.” she’s not beautiful, and neither am i. look, i look like a thumb with two thumbs. okay? you put me in a dress, i’d be even more disgusting. “beauty’s unusual.” there’s a lot of cool shit that isn’t beautiful. sixty-year-old dudes in skirts are on that list. jesus f*cking christ! what kind of games are we playing here? why are you lying to children? that’s beautiful. what are my kids gonna think when they see a mountain or a rose? “is that beautiful too, daddy? explain.” ahhh! bang! i can’t! the world’s gone f*cking bananas! “what you’re saying is horribly transphobic and incredibly regressive. you should be embarrassed at what you’re doing. you’re doing this just to get laughs at someone else’s expense.” maybe! or maybe bruce jenner lived with demons. maybe they waited by the bed… until they knew he was in heavy rem sleep… so they could assume their true form. [squawking] climb up and kick off their designer shoes to reveal black raven’s claws. clutched the edge of the bed and just… whispered in his ear. [snarls] [imitating demon] “bruce… [breathing heavily] we would like you better if you were one of us.” “[groaning] i can’t. i can’t be one of you. i was… i was born a man.” “nonsense! [snarling] [hissing] nonsense. bruce… you no longer can be held prisoner by the gender of your birth. you’re free. bruce… [snarling] your lips are too thin… for the cover of vanity fair.” “huh? what? wait. wait. did you say the cover? okay. are you f*cking with me? because… you know the cover’s always been my dream.” “it can be real! [snarls] it can be real. all dreams… can be real through surgery. sleep.” [audience cheering and applauding] thank you very much, san francisco! i had a great f*cking time with you savages! let’s take a selfie. shit. we got it. putting together one of these f*cking specials is stressful as shit. i appreciate the f*ck out of all you people being here tonight. and i love you guys. thank you very much!

            "   ladies and gentlemen, welcome joe rogan.  what the f*ck is going on, san francisco? thanks for coming. i appreciate it! god damn! put your phone down, f*ckface! i see you, b*tch! put your phone down! motherf*ckers. they can’t use their eyes. everybody’s gotta live through their goddamn phone. whoo! i’m high as f*ck. whoo. it’s strange. i wasn’t sure if i was gonna do this sober. i’m like, “ugh…” it’s not the move. not in san francisco. this is… i love pot, but the people that are making edibles need to slow the f*ck down. oh, my god! what are you trying to do to people? i had a pot gummy bear the other day. i think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldn’t be able to steal your soul. right? how the f*ck are these people making these things, man? they’re not consistent. that’s also part of the problem. you don’t know what you’re getting, ’cause they’re not making them the same place where they make tylenol. nah, it’s some greasy dude with a grateful dead t-shirt on and a gray ponytail. he’s got a bowl of ingredients, and he can’t remember whether or not he put weed in yet. this dude’s time traveling, just back and forth. he just keeps chucking weed in there until it looks like lawn trimmings. you eat it, and it’s not what you’re looking for. it’s not regulated. you gotta ask questions. i asked a dude at the pot store. i go, “hey, man, how strong are the gummy bears?” he goes… that’s not a unit of measurement. he’s like, “el diablo. el diablo.” “f*ck, man. how much should i take?” “just the leg.” “just the leg? why are you selling whole bears? what the f*ck are you trying to prove, man?” they just watch you leave with that bear. they go, “oh, shit.” they know. they know you’re not gonna die. you’re gonna think you’re gonna die, but everybody lives. learn some shit. we learn some shit from the scary trips. see, the thing about edibles, one of the problems with it being illegal, is that a lot of us don’t have a lot of information that we could use. like, there’s a difference between smoking it and eating it. when you smoke it, you get thc. but when you eat it, it’s processed by your liver, and it produces something called 11-hydroxy metabolite that’s five times more psychoactive than thc. and it lets you talk to dolphins.  this is a real moment that changed my life. i was in hawaii, and we were on a boat, and we were fishing. we were pulling these lines behind the boat, and i was so high, i was trying to figure out which way the earth was spinning. like, the boat’s going this way, and the sun’s up there. i’m like, “um…” for like 20 minutes, i’m paralyzed. so, while this is all happening, these dolphins just show up. and if you’ve ever been around wild dolphins, they’re very trippy. it’s very different than you expect, because they look at you. they, like, check you out. they, like, pop out of the water and they, like, look at you… like a person, not like a f*cking deer or woodchuck. they look at you like another person. granted, i was so high i thought i was gonna die, but… i’m making eye contact with these dolphins, and i started thinking, “how smart are these f*cking things?” because we’re fishing. dolphins eat fish. but you never catch dolphins. ever. no one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin. and all i could think of while these dolphins were, like, hopping through the water, and looking at us and shit… i was thinking, “if people lived in the water, you’d f*cking catch ’em all day.” they wouldn’t even have to live in the water. if cheeseburgers just floated down geary street… at least once a week, a guy would be like, “i’m taking a chance.” and you see ’em getting yanked up to the clouds. “f*ck! we lost billy!” the bottom of his sneakers in a puff of cloud. you don’t catch dolphins on fishhooks, man. that’s weird. they’re around fishing all the time and like, “b*tch.” they’re f*cking smart. how smart? well, i watched a dolphin documentary, and it said they have a cerebral cortex that’s 40% larger than a human being’s. i don’t know what that means, but if you say it right and don’t f*ck up the words, it makes you sound smarter than you really are. i think what it means is they have big f*cking brains. but we don’t think of them as being smart ’cause they don’t do what we do. right? they don’t send e-mails. they don’t have houses. but if you lived in their world, you don’t need anything. you don’t need your fingers. no one’s typing. they have a language that’s so complex, we can’t understand it. all the food’s free. they stay where the water’s warm. i started thinking, “how f*cking smart are they? what if they’re exactly the same as us? what if it’s just some different branch of evolution? we went one way. they went the other. what if consciousness is the same?” i was thinking, “what if me to me is the same as me to a dolphin?” the way you think of yourself when you say the word “me.” i was like, “what if that’s exactly how a dolphin feels? they’re just living life through different biology, different genetics, different life experiences. but if i lived a dolphin’s life, i would be him. and if he lived my life, he would be me.” and then i started thinking, “what if that’s the case with people? what if everyone is exactly the same? we’re just living life through different bodies. what if that’s the secret of happiness? treat everyone as if it’s you living another life.”  i mean… and then i thought, “god damn, how good is this weed i’m getting in california? whoo! i’m on a f*cking floating craft out in the middle of the ocean, talking to water people.” the problem with treating everybody as if it’s you living another life is you wanna f*cking smack yourself. half the people you meet, you just wanna f*cking smack ’em. we live in the weirdest time ever. i mean, it’s the most awesome time ever. but it’s the weirdest time ever, too. we’re, like, that close to president trump.  no. boo! “no. boo!” you boo, but you won’t vote, you f*cks! all those bernie sanders people, “yo, bernie’s the shit.” “did you vote for him?” “voting ain’t real, bro. it doesn’t even work, dude.” we are that close to president trump. bill cosby’s a rapist, and bruce jenner’s a chick. we’re in an episode of lost. down is up and up is down! this is the type of world you get when you give kids participation trophies for getting their ass kicked in soccer games. this is the world we get! we get a goddamn nerfed-up world filled with nonsense. nobody wants to be president. nobody. i hope hillary wins. that way we can realize chicks can’t do that f*cking job either. it’s a stupid job. it’s a stupid job invented back when people used to write with feathers. it’s dumb! it’s just some old-school shit that we need to get rid of. it doesn’t make any sense. being president is great if there’s like 50 people. if there’s 50 people, you can figure out which one’s the best. three hundred million people? i have three kids. i don’t know where the f*ck they are right now. how is this one dude in charge of 300 million people? it’s nonsense. it’s so old and stupid. they make this guy sleep in this f*cking white house. if trump wins, you know his house is cooler than the white house. he’s like, “i’m not sleeping in that shitty-ass, stupid house.” trump’s probably got, like, a tube at home that he opens up, and a chinese girl just pops out of it, and sucks his dick and goes right back in. that’s what i would do if i had that kind of money. we’re down to assholes! where’s elon musk when you need him? where’s the f*cking geniuses? where’s mark cuban? no. we got an old lady trying to get back at her husband for a blowjob he got in the ’90s. we got an old man who hates money. and we got a reality tv star with a plastic set of hair. you can’t have a president with environmental concerns, when every time this motherf*cker does his hair, we lose a foot of ozone layer and a polar bear bursts into flames. he’s got, like, a closet full of aqua net at home. you can’t pretend you don’t give a f*ck when you have that thing going on, dude. stop that. the white house got broken into while obama was in office. the first time in over 100 years that someone broke into the white house. also, the first time a girl was guarding the front door by herself. “what are you trying to say, that women can’t do everything men can do?” exactly. that’s exactly what i’m saying. that seems sexist, right? people say, “you’re sexist.” no, it’s not sexist. here’s why it’s not sexist. ‘cause men can’t even do everything men can do. see? there’s no physical equality, folks. that’s why we have the olympics. ‘cause there’s people that can do some shit that you and i can’t do. one of those things is guarding the f*cking white house. i know i can’t guard the white house. you know how i know? because i’ve met shaquille o’neal and his dick is where my face is. that’s not equality. that’s not white privilege. listen, if the white house is experiencing a shaq attack, i’m the wrong dude to save the world. i did fear factor with shaq. if we’re holding hands, it’d be like a six-year-old at the park with his dad. we’re barely the same thing. so, do i think women should guard the white house? no. i don’t think i should, either. it’s not sexist to say that women can’t do big physical labor things as good as giant men can. but people will tell you it is. well, i’m not sexist. as a matter of fact, my favorite people are all female. i have a wife and i have three daughters. they’re my favorite people in the world. but i could beat the f*ck out of all of them. okay? listen… if they’re guarding the door, i’m getting in. i don’t mean to sound cocky. but i’m just real confident. i could f*ck them up if i had the flu. okay? yeah, we’re different. we’re different. i could beat up my cat, too. i’m not proud of it. i just tell you what’s up. if you wanna bet money, bet money on me. i’ll f*ck that cat up. most likely. cats are f*cking weird like that, man. i was petting my cat once and he bit me. i was like, “whoa! are we gonna do this? what the f*ck are you doing here?” i got a little nervous. got a little nervous. “women can do everything men can do. this guy’s a piece of shit. we’re leaving. too much information is going in that i don’t agree with!” “what the guy said was total bullshit. total bullshit.” how’d that girl get that job? i’ll tell you how that girl got that job. because someone let her have that job. which means, either there were a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her… or her boss was a chick and she hated her. either one’s possible. look, if there was a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her, that makes total sense. if there’s one hot girl and she’s working with five guys in an office, no work’s getting done in that office. that office is now just an audition to see which guy gets to f*ck her. each one of those guys will just slowly start to morph to figure out what this girl likes. men become like an octopus that tries to fit its way through a keyhole. “there’s gotta be a f*cking way. there’s gotta be a f*cking way!” you got this girl who’s like, “i could guard the front door.” “oh, you could definitely guard the door. no doubt. no doubt.” and over time, if this woman doesn’t sleep with one of these men and claim him, over time, these guys will just start morphing. and they’ll just start saying ridiculous, preposterous shit. “debbie wants to guard the front door. do you have a problem with that?” “no, i don’t. as a matter of fact, i think women are amazing. plus, i’m vegan.” and they will just… they will wear patchouli. they will do what the f*ck they have to do. next thing you know, poor f*cking debbie at the front door… “why am i alone?”  the whole story is so bananas. and it’s one of my favorite stories. so i’m gonna give you the whole story of the break-in at the white house with no edits and no comic exaggerations. this is the real story. ‘cause a lot of people think there’s some grand conspiracy. there’s some cabal of evil geniuses that’s pulling the strings on everyone in america. it’s most likely that people are just dumb as f*ck, in all sorts of walks of life. this is the story. this is the real story about the person who broke into the white house. first of all, people are always worried, “the government’s checking out my e-mails, bro. the government’s watching us all the time.” they pulled this guy over two months before he broke into the white house. he had four handguns, two rifles and a machete with him. they didn’t even watch him. he had a map. on the map was washington, and it had an “x” where the white house is. they’re like, “you’re good to go.” they let him go! two months later, this motherf*cker broke into the white house. and why did he break into the white house? why do you break into the white house ever? because you want to die. you don’t… that’s like a suicide run. that’s the only reason why someone runs toward the white house. if you had to ask someone, “what kind of security do you think they have at the white house?” “oh, dude… they got snipers on every corner. they got lasers in the grass. if you get too far, they open up a door, you drop right into jail.” nope. turns out they don’t even have a dog. you just f*cking run. the guy who made it into the white house, he had 800 rounds of ammunition in his car. left that there. took a knife. that’s a guy who wants to die! he’s just sitting in his f*cking car going, “f*ck the government! f*ck my ex-wife! and f*ck everybody! i’m gonna do this! f*ck you!” just sprinting, “oh, my god, i’m doing it! oh, my god, i’m doing it!” thinking, with every step, “this is gonna be the last step of my life. no, this is gonna be the last step of my life. no, this…” and he gets to the front door. it’s unlocked! he opens it. there’s a girl there by herself. smacks her to the ground and just starts running through the hall. ah! he’s probably going, “why am i alive?” he’s probably thinking… he was inside for minutes. for minutes, running around. he got tackled by an off-duty officer. he was probably thinking, “i wanted to die. i don’t want to go to f*cking jail. will somebody please shoot me?” then he was probably pissed. “where are my tax dollars going? what kind of security are you f*cking people running in this place?” \n",
            "imagine when obama found out a girl was guarding him. he was probably like, “everybody, everybody, not that much diversity. i mean, what, are you playing f*cking fairy tale games here?” obama’s got a hard job, ’cause he’s the first president that’s ever been around while google was here. you know, he could google his own name if he gets crazy in the middle of the night. right? “so, let me see what the people have to say.” he’d just go, “obama is a…”  “i’m none of those f*cking things.” freakin’ out. shit.  probably thinking, “why the f*ck did i do this?” i think the guy who broke into the white house and obama probably have a lot in common. in that… they went for it, but they probably never really thought they were getting in there. you can’t quit once you’re the president. the moment obama actually got into office, like, “good morning, mr. president,” he was probably like, “oh, no! what the f*ck did i do this for? i didn’t think i was actually gonna get in.  i can’t sleep. i’m freaking out. everybody wants to kill me.  who the f*ck is guarding me?” looks out in the hallway. there’s a girl taking selfies. that’d be the greatest selfie of all time. a girl with her ass out, duck lips, in the background, a dude’s breaking into the white house.  you know i’m not making this up. you’ve all seen this. this is recognizable. pigeon-toed is a good move ’cause you can’t get away that good. you just, like… like there’s something wrong with your back. that’s a recognizable pose. when did that start? ‘cause if you look at the original pictures back when people first invented pictures, everybody just stood there looking hungry. like, if you saw a photo from the 1800s, and in the background a girl was going… she’s a f*cking time traveler! nobody knew that move back then. somebody had to see their face. “oh, people like that. they like what i’m doing.” combo. a two-hole combo attractor. it’s all over online! it gets you a lot of likes. i saw a gal on instagram, she has eight million followers. all she does is take pictures of her ass. that’s it. she’s got a winning formula. she sticks with it. no witty memes. there’s no inspirational quotes. mnh-mnh. mnh-mnh. just a lot of this. different ways. and she’s just a regular girl, man. i’m watching this, i’m like, “this is a different kind of person.” she has eight million people that have no idea what her voice sounds like. she doesn’t have a job that they like. she doesn’t have an occupation that they follow. they’re just staring at her ass. this is a new kind of human. there’s never been a person, psychologically, that’s had to navigate those kind of waters. if you really stop and think about it, science should really step in and start looking at this. don’t go to south america to study some new frog that nobody gives a f*ck about. there’s a girl in florida with eight million people staring at her ass. how does this girl keep a relationship? what is her day like? how many dick pics does she get sent? how many dick pics does that girl receive on a daily basis? is it like the national debt counter was just f*cking spinning out of control constantly? i bet if she turns on the notifications, her phone just starts screaming and runs away from her. i bet if she deletes all the dick pics from her phone, it would be physically lighter. this is a new kind of person. we really have to understand, there’s never been a person like this before. and she’s just a person. like, that kind of influence, that kind of attractant, that’s a very strong drug to have in the hands of just a girl. and as a guy who has daughters, i just think of that, like, that’s kind of f*cking… that’s weird. because this girl has eight million people staring at her ass. eight million creeps and weirdos and perverts objectifying her. i mean, i follow her, but i’m not like those other assholes. i’m different. i care. i care about who she is. i’m a nice person. i’m a hero or something.  “i’m different. those other guys are assholes. men are noble. men are noble and true.” mmm. if we get to come. if men don’t get to come, we get real sméagol-like real quick. just a few months of no dates,  “mesus is just so disappointed with all the mens mesus meets. mesus is so embarrassed at how other mens talks to you. mmm. oh.” everyone wants to set themselves up as being the noble one. everybody wants to be matthew mcconaughey, to save the world on a rocket ship. there’s people that are signing up to go to mars. do you know about this? there’s a mission to mars, a manned mission to mars, where 200,000 people have signed up to be amongst the four people to die on mars. they’re gonna take a one-way trip to mars. that’s some sad shit for a bunch of reasons. first of all, it’s some sad shit, ’cause that’s 200,000 people that don’t have any real friends. right? if it’s someone you love, your real friend… if one of my friends is gonna move to florida, i’ll be like, “b*tch, where the f*ck are you going? you’re gonna go to florida? we can’t hang out if you go to florida. why the f*ck are you moving to florida, man?” but you might be able to deal with it. “we can just visit each other every now and then.” but if your friend was gonna move to mars, you’d be like, “oh, really? get in the f*cking car! just get in the car, dude.” take him out to death valley, “look around! sucks, right? mars sucks worse. get back in the car, stupid.” jesus christ! there’s places in america you can’t live, man. you don’t wanna live in detroit, why the f*ck are you talking about moving to mars? people really consider moving to mars. it’s one of the dumbest ideas ever. but if you say that, people will eco-bro you. have you ever been eco-broed? these people will find an opportunity to virtue signal over you, as michael shermer likes to point out. like, puff their chest out and say that they’re probably better than you. “hey, dude. seriously? you think there’s something wrong with going to mars? well, i don’t know if you’ve paid attention, man. we maybe should colonize mars ’cause california’s almost out of water.” then he’ll nod, like, “yeah, b*tch.” we’re right next to the ocean. what the f*ck are you talking about? look at all that water. you fly over it, it takes a day. the world’s blue. it’s more water than it is not water. we have a salt problem. we don’t have a water problem. suck the salt out of the water, we got a goddamn party. instead of pissing and moaning… “too complicated, bro. we gotta go to neptune.” oh, my god! you’re f*cking crazy. we’re a crazy race filled with crazy people. we’re like a dude with a dirty house. like, “man, i gotta build a new house.” no, you gotta stop shitting in your kitchen. stop piling up newspapers you’re never gonna read in front of your bathroom, you f*ck! we’re crazy! one-way trip to mars. a one-way trip in coach with three other people so f*cking stupid, they’re willing to die on mars with you. great. what great conversation you’re gonna have. it’s nonsense, folks. my friend was like, “they’re not gonna die on mars, man. if people are smart enough to figure out how to get to mars, they’re smart enough to figure out how to get back.” here’s why that doesn’t make any sense. people smart enough to get to mars aren’t going. see, that’s the dirty secret about rocket travel, ladies and gentlemen. nobody smart enough to make a rocket ever gets in one of those f*cking things. no. no, they look at each other right before the launch and they go… they talk german and they get behind giant f*cking concrete bunkers. they take some square-jawed, corn-fed dude from the middle of the country, tuck a bible under that dude’s arm and strap him into that giant metal dick, and shoot it off into the heavens. that’s what we do. and that is what that is. that is a metal dick. it’s a robot dick, and we’re trying to f*ck the sky. we are literally trying to come people out of the tip of a metal dick onto other planets. our ultimate goal is that we get those planets pregnant, and they’re too filled up with people, and then they gotta make a new metal dick. “bro, we gotta go to jupiter.” then they make another one. they shoot that f*cking thing, and they fill jupiter up. we just keep filling the cosmos up with people. and we never evolve. and we never change. we stay perfect, like we are right now. who’s in? you’re gonna all come with me. we’re gonna leave here right now and go to the church of scientology right down the street, and it’s all gonna make sense when you find out that you are an eternal being that created reality so that you can enjoy it. i watched that hbo documentary a couple too many times. i went clear, i think. i think i’m clear. i’m back! i’m back now. if you haven’t seen…  i had to watch going clear, a scientology documentary, ’cause i have a neighbor who’s a scientologist, and i don’t even think he’s gay. i don’t know what the f*ck’s going on.  but he sleeps really close to me, you know. like, my bed’s here, this f*cking dude’s bed’s, like, over there. his house is… i mean, if you take away the walls, he’s f*cking right there. it’s like, “what does this crazy f*ck believe?” and scientology is a wonderful religion. not just because it was written by a science fiction author who wrote more fake shit than anyone that’s ever walked the face of the earth. and not by a small amount. this dude never made a second draft in his f*cking life. everything was one draft of nonsense. and he wrote more of it than anybody. not in his neighborhood, not in his state, not in a year, not in a decade. more than anyone that’s ever lived, ever. and scientology is still like, “i don’t see any red flags. i think we’re good. i think this is legit as f*ck.” if scientology is a good religion, it’s because other religions get to make fun of ’em. it’s like it’s the one religion that even the mormons are like, “b*tch, you believe what? hold on. i mean, at least we don’t have video of joseph smith. there’s some f*cking shitty black and white footage of l. ron hubbard with a captain’s outfit on. you wanna explain that?  why does he have all those awards on? why is tom cruise wearing a gold medal the size of a dinner plate? what the f*ck is going on with you people?” i watched it with my mom, and it was like… first of all, scientology, they don’t pay taxes. that’s disturbing. they’re tax-free, which means they’re a recognized religion by the government of the united states. which means the government of the united states had to go over what they believe and went, “everything seems in order. none of this shit seems like a cult.” well, what the f*ck is a cult, and what’s a religion? so i had to look it up. turns out… i don’t know who wrote this, but it’s a perfect definition. a cult is bullshit. it’s created by one person. that person knows it’s bullshit. in a religion, that dude’s dead. so it’s a religion ’cause l. ron hubbard’s dead. so i guess they got it on a loophole. i watched it with my mom, and my mom was like, “i can’t believe anybody would fall for that.” “you made me go to catholic school. the f*ck are you talking about? there was a child molester dressed like a sorcerer sitting on a golden throne, and you made me call him father. slow your roll, lady.” imagine if i talked to my mom like that. oh, my god. jokes, folks. just jokes. i don’t have a problem with people being religious because i just think life itself is too open-ended. it’s too confusing. and i think we’re evolving. and part of our struggle in evolving is unanswered questions. we wanna seek these answers. but in the meanwhile, they just give you so much anxiety, and it f*cks with you so much. there’s nothing wrong with joining a cult. i think you gotta just join a nice, friendly one. like, the mormons are a good cult. here’s why. they don’t get mad at anybody. like, they never kill anybody. like, here’s a perfect example. matt stone and trey parker, the guys who created south park, they made a hilarious musical called the book of mormon. it’s fantastic. if you haven’t seen it, it’s so f*cking hilarious. but it’s also brutal! brutal about the mormons. you know what the mormons did? they went to see it, and they took out a full-page ad in the playbill. it said, “if you enjoyed this musical and you wanna find out more about being a mormon, please visit our website.” they just took it right on the chin like champs. they didn’t get mad. they didn’t get defensive. they didn’t kill anybody. that’s a good cult. they just said, “what do you wanna do?” “we got nine wives. shut the f*ck up!” “everybody just… everybody, just chill. just chill.” that’s a good religion. that’s a good cult. some cults aren’t that good. they get f*cking testy. you know the one. we don’t have to say who. you know what i’m talking about. there’s that one that will kill you if you draw their guy. “come on, man. i can’t even draw your dude? what if i draw a dude drawing your dude?” “no loopholes!” “f*ckin’ relax, bro.” and this isn’t just theoretical. people have died ’cause they made cartoons. before the most recent paris attacks, there was a magazine called charlie hebdo, and they were attacked, where 11 cartoonists were killed. eleven more were wounded, and they killed a cop, too. f*cking crazy! over cartoons! and when you… when there’s radical, crazy people in the world, what’s interesting is the reaction to radical, crazy people and how everything just sort of kind of balances itself out when things get weird. because when these people got killed over a cartoon, the whole world was in shock. the whole world was outraged. but one of the scariest things about it was nobody wanted to print those pictures. you couldn’t see ’em in the la times. you couldn’t find them in time magazine. you had to go online and find them. it was a dark moment for free speech, because everybody’s like, “oh. i don’t wanna get killed. i don’t wanna show the pictures.” it was weird, until… the balance. because after they got killed and nobody wanted to print the pictures, word got back to texas… where they promptly held a “draw muhammad” contest in garland, texas. i’m not making a word of this up. you can google it, and i’ll wait. they had a “draw muhammad” contest in garland, texas. two dudes showed up, started shooting at the building. they were killed almost instantly. why? because they were at a “draw muhammad” contest in texas. how obvious does a trap have to be before you start getting suspicious? what, are you livin’ in a wile e. coyote cartoon, motherf*cker? you ever go to texas? that’s not santa monica, b*tch. that’s a totally different kind of white people. those are some wild west people that have computers and modern guns. they’re not supposed to be there. people didn’t evolve in texas. it’s not like they were monkeys, then they became people and they stayed in that spot. no. no, they landed on boats on the east coast. the stubborn ones stayed. the smart ones made it to california. but along the way, we lost a bunch of people.  and some of them just stuck around. “y’all go ahead. we’re gonna hang back here. i’m gonna draw the biggest dick the world’s ever seen in the sand. my wife’s got the biggest titties. i’mma try to f*ck a snake. i think it can be done.” they just stayed. they just gathered cattle, stockpiled ammo. and they all talk alike. and that’s why you gotta be nervous. you gotta be nervous in places with accents, okay? it’s one of the reasons why i can prove that california is the best spot to live. ‘cause all the spots that suck, they all have to sound like each other. ‘cause i grew up in a place like that. i grew up in boston. it’s not that the people in boston suck, but the weather sucks. it’s f*cking horrible. and in the winter everybody gets in their car in the morning, and just goes, “f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck! f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck!” and everybody’s worried about… it’s a real possibility you might starve to death one day. you might freeze trying to walk home.  so they all talk in the same way. “oh, my god. how many more months till summer? ahhh! when is this f*cking winter gonna be over? we need more firewood.”  they have to sound like the people around them. so if other people invade, like, “we stick together. we’re all in this together.” that’s how they are in texas, too. they’re like, “y’all ain’t from around here, are ya?” they have a f*cking certain way of talking. which is proof positive why california is the best spot. try making fun of a california accent. what are you gonna do? speak clear and concise? what are you gonna do? you gonna mock us? you’re gonna say some shit that everybody understands? they’re not supposed to be in texas, folks. it’s not even a state. it’s a republic. they were like, “man, we ain’t so sure about this whole united states thing. we’re gonna hang back. hang back, see how this plays out.” they don’t have any rules. they have like three pages of rule books. here’s how i know this. i’m gonna tell you a fact, a fact about texas that will change the way you think about texas. there are more tigers in captivity in texas, in private collections, than there are in all of the wild of the world. i’m gonna repeat it because i know you’re like, “oh, the fear factor guy is just making shit up to make his jokes work.” no. there’s more tigers in dudes’ yards in texas than the rest of the f*cking planet! how is that possible? because they can. because they went through the rule book…  “it don’t say shit about tigers. order it up, dude. order it up, dude!” one guy got a tiger, and his neighbor’s like, “shit, i didn’t know we could get tigers.” and he got two tigers. and the first guy was like, “i ain’t about to let this faggot out-tiger me.” and he opened up tiger world with his oil money. we’re gonna need those people, folks, if the russians invade. we can’t make f*cking warrior babies with those chicks in marin county with fake asses and rubber lips, okay? we’re gonna need some real warrior genes. we’re gonna need some women who wear non-ironic daisy dukes. they got cowboy boots with no socks and stinky feet. and they yell out, “chris kyle, rest in peace,” when you make ’em come. we need those women! if the russians come, we gotta be ready. think about the children. think about the children while i get a sip. this is super important, ladies and gentlemen. a lot of people are sleeping on…  imagine if i had real points. oh, jesus christ.  i love you f*ckers, too, man. so excited to be here.  i have kids and i lie to them. i get high around ’em, too. people say you shouldn’t do that, but they don’t see it. they say you shouldn’t be intoxicated around your children. well, i’m not. i’m high. i call it “elevated.” it’s a different thing. the people who have a problem with that, they don’t understand what getting high is. like, they think you’re gonna be to your kid, like, “who are you?” what do you think? what’s the worst thing that can happen if i’m a little high around my kid? they’re gonna get extra hugs, and daddy’s going to be paranoid about objects. “look out. don’t go there.” that’s it. plus, i have cool conversations. i have a six-year-old daughter, man. there’s not a lot of 48-year-old man and 6-year-old girl have in common, other than the fact she’s my daughter. and so, our conversations are normally pretty boring. but when i’m high, i’m like, “you know, you call that thing your baby, your doll. you call it your baby, but you know it’s not a baby, right?” “yeah, i know it’s not a baby.” “do you call it a baby because you’re the youngest and you like having someone who is responsible for you?” “maybe.” “okay. that’s cool. that’s cool. give me a hug. i love you.”  it’s weird, man. it’s weird raising little people. there’s some things that i didn’t expect. one of the things i didn’t expect is you have to lie to them. like, you don’t have to lie to them about a lot of things, but you have to lie to them about santa claus. it’s just one of those things, man, ’cause it’s like a community. you have to think about what your kid’s gonna tell other kids. because when it comes to santa claus, you don’t want your kid to be one of two things. you don’t want your kid to be the first kid that tells everyone that santa claus is bullshit, ’cause that kid’s an asshole. but you don’t want your kid to be the last kid that figures out that santa claus is bullshit, ’cause that kid’s a moron. so you got… you got a little bit of… you’re like, “oh, no. when do we do this? when do we do this?” and no one knows when to do it. you just let the kids figure it out. then they’re like, “dad, what the f*ck?” you’re like, “aw… oh, i missed the boat. i missed the boat.” nobody knows when to do it. nobody can be honest about it. they have little meetings and shit. and i’m like, “when do we tell ’em?” this lady goes, “when they’re 11.” they’re gonna be f*cking by then. i told her it was funny. she didn’t believe me. i’m like, “oh, i’m sorry. i’m off by a year.” that’s not as funny, but it’s… i didn’t mean it. but it’s this thing. they want to keep the kids in the dark. and they wanna pretend they’re the only one that’s teaching the kid. this is a weird thing that people do. they’re like, “i teach my kids, man. i teach my kids.” “eh… when you see ’em.” but unless you’re some freak who homeschools your children in the forest, your kid’s gonna go to school. they’re gonna go to school, and they’re gonna be in a class with 50 other kids. the teacher only makes 20 bucks a year, and she’s thinking about dick. that’s all she’s thinking about. she’s thinking about getting stuffed. she’s a young, fertile woman who loves kids. and she’s writing on that chalkboard. and the kids all huddle up and share information. like, “yeah, what did your dad tell you? your dad tell you that, yeah? my dad says santa claus is f*cking bullshit, okay? you ever go near a chimney? it’s that big. what the f*ck? teacher’s coming. play with blocks. act stupid. uh, how does this work?” they play dumb. they play dumb! they’re like little prisoners, trying to figure their way out. they make little papier-mâché heads and pretend they’re napping. they’re little humans. they wanna run shit. “who is these people telling us what to do? are they being straight with us, man? what the f*ck is going on?” i knew the day my daughter knew that santa claus is bullshit. she came home, stared me down. she was, like, mad-dogging me. she took her book bag, and just goes…  walked right up to the chimney, looking at me. “how the f*ck?” “dad, have you ever met santa claus?” “no, honey, i’ve never met him.” “but you let him in the house?” and there’s this moment… it was a moment where a seven-year-old has you at checkmate. you’re like, “oh, shit.” i don’t know whether to high-five her or to keep lying. you wanna go, “yeah, you got me. you got me. you got me. that’s bullshit. no, the big bang is real, but this is bullshit.” the big bang sounds even less real. the problem is, you have to be consistent. if you’re teaching your kids nonsense, you gotta teach ’em only nonsense. you can’t mix nonsense in with, like, real stuff. like, my daughter will go like, “how do birds fly?” i go, “birds have bones that are hollow, so they’re really light. then they have feathers, which cover a large surface area. and they use the hollow bones and the feathers to push down on the air. see, the air looks like it’s nothing, right? but it’s actually a bunch of gases. that’s why the trees move when the wind blows. the birds can manipulate that and go through 3-d space.” “whoa!” “yeah, nature is crazy.” “yeah. how does the fat man get through the little hole?” “magic! christmas magic! now go to bed. i’m trying to f*ck your mom! go to bed!”  jokes, folks. just jokes. can’t talk like that. that’s how you make strippers. you gotta be nice. they’re little, tiny people. they’re adorable. they don’t know anything yet. you gotta teach ’em everything. you can’t talk mean.  kids are a lot like really f*cking stupid people… in that if you get ten really stupid people in a room, the most confident one just starts running shit. they don’t have to have any more information, they just have to be more confident. if you get a bunch of dummies together, they’re like, “i don’t know what’s going on.” “i don’t know what’s going on.” “i f*cking do. i f*cking do.” the guy doesn’t have to have any extra data, he just has to be the only one that’s confident. and that’s what it’s like in school. my daughter’s class has this f*cking kid named debbie. and every day it’s, “debbie says…” oh, f*cking debbie says. debbie says what? you don’t think about that before you have kids. not only are you gonna have kids, but your kids are gonna make friends, and then you have to make friends with the f*cking parents of your kids. and some of ’em are crazy. my daughter’s like, “debbie says adam and eve are the only two people in the world, and all people came from them. is that true?”  and this is weird. like, you don’t know what to do, right? you want to be diplomatic. you don’t want to cause problems at school. but you gotta be honest. and one of the most difficult things to say to a kid is, “i don’t know.” i’m like, “sweetie, i don’t know. i don’t know if adam and eve is where people came from. but nobody knows, because no one from today is alive back then. so it’s not something you can measure. so it’s not something you can see. so we don’t know. but here’s what we do know. you know how some people have big ears and some people have little ears?” “yeah.” “well, some people have brains that are made out of dog shit. and they get horny, too. and what happens is, they have to find someone even dumber than them to have sex with. it’s like the opposite of evolution. and then they have a kid, and their kid is f*cked. their kid is f*cked! and everybody wants to pretend it’s a level playing field. there’s no level, anywhere you look. is an eagle and a salmon level? does the salmon ever get to eat the eagle? no. the universe does not want even! it wants conflict and resolution and constant improvement. okay? i’m gonna shut this light out, and i’m gonna go f*ck your mom right in the mouth. all right?” i don’t say these things. i don’t say any of these things! i was like, “i don’t know. maybe debbie’s right. doesn’t make sense to me. how would that work?” “how would that work?” “it wouldn’t work, would it?” adam and eve are the only two people. they have kids. and then, where do all the other people come from? i guess the kids just start f*cking each other. is that what happens? mom f*cks the kids, or the… yeah, exactly. debbie’s parents. they were at my house, man, for a cookout, and the dude told me the earth’s 10,000 years old. they’re young earth christians. they’re sweet people, by the way. before i shit on them… i’m gonna shit on them, but before i shit on them, they’re sweet. they’re really nice people. i hug ’em every time i see ’em. they’re really kind, nice people. but they just found a part of their brain, they’re like, “i have no use for this.”  chucked that whole logic, discerning-reason part. “this f*cking thing’s confusing.” they’re young earth christians, which means they follow the strictest interpretation of the bible possible. i’m like, “how many people believe the earth is less than 10,000 years old?” uh! i looked it up. there’s a recent gallup poll that said that 46% of america believes the earth is less than 10,000 years old.  here’s why you shouldn’t be scared. they can only measure people dumb enough to answer polls. and when you factor that in, you’re talking about a really small number. ‘cause you know what the average response is if you call people up and say, “how old’s the earth?” number one answer is, “older than your mother’s pussy.” and then they hang up. number two answer is, “f*ck you!” after that, you start throwing numbers around. and only 46% of those dummies were stupid enough to think the earth is 10,000 years old. that’s debbie’s f*cking parents. so out of the people that answer polls… is it even 1%? it might be 1%. only 46% are that f*cking stupid. and that’s the 1% we should really be worried about. we’re worried about the wrong 1%. not that we shouldn’t be worried about the really rich, greedy people. we definitely should. we should definitely worry about bankers and people who… they’re just stockpiling resources. they could help the world in some really impossible ways for anybody else. but they don’t. they’d rather just pile up their gold.  yeah, that 1% is awful. but there’s another 1% that freaks me the f*ck out that no one’s talking about. that’s the 1% who leave comments on youtube videos. who the f*ck are those freaks? could you imagine people talking to each other like that in real life and not beating the shit out of each other? i mean, if jesus christ himself came back from the dead and had a youtube page, the first comment would be, “you ain’t shit without your dad, pussy.” these are monsters. this is not a normal person’s response. normal people don’t leave comments. what a normal person does, they watch a video. they like it or they don’t like it. that’s it. it ends right there. but what you’re dealing with is the process of racism, and child abuse, and neglect and shitty genes. and the insane clown posse is playing. they know all the words, and they’re wafting up their farts, and their cheez doodle fingers. and like, “an open letter to jennifer lopez… let me pause and just jerk off in my shirt real quick, here.  ugh… dear, jennifer, don’t you think it’s about time you dress a little more classy? what are your children gonna see when they see…” just f*cking think of the meanest, most biting shit that’s gonna cut it. as if jennifer lopez has time in between eating diamonds and f*cking all her background dancers in a castle that she built with her ass. but you know, “let me check the youtube comments to see if my self-esteem’s on point. oh!” and you know who’s dumber than them? me. ‘cause i read their shit and i get mad. i know they’re stupid. i still get upset. f*ck! this is the world, folks. this is the world we’re living in. are we happy? i’m not sure. is this what we wanted? i don’t know.  no! no.  no! are you sure?  no! why are you doing this? what is this? what are you doing? are you fighting for freedom? what’s happening?  no! are you white panthers? what is this?  life sucks! what are you saying?  life can kind of suck sometimes. life can kind of suck? maybe it’s how you’re livin’ it, b*tch. “life can kind of suck.” it’s the greatest time ever to be alive. “yeah, i’d live in the old days when you could die from crabs.” it doesn’t get any better than today, man. so stupid. “make america great again.” it’s as good as it’s ever been. what the f*ck are you saying? we have 4g everywhere. when has it been better? we have netflix. when has it been better? come on, man. stop. it’s never been better. this is as good as it’s ever been. it’s just weird. it’s just weird. you gotta get your shit together, b*tch. don’t blame the world. god damn it. damn it, man. and listen, if you’ve seen any of this show, and you said, “i think some of the stuff you’re saying is really funny, but i sense a lot of, like, macho posturing from you. i sense a lot of, like, bullshit, tough-guy stuff.” you’re totally correct. and what it is is i live with all women, okay? and i’m becoming more of a b*tch every day of my life. and i just wanna say i’m not unhappy. i’ve never been more happy in my life. this is the happiest i’ve ever been. but when you’re with all girls, like, you have all girls all the time, you have to make little compromises. you don’t think about it while it’s happening. it’s like the rock doesn’t think about the water carving a path through it, but eventually, that f*cking path is gonna get deep. and when you’re with all people that are different than you, they just go, “hmm…” they just start looking at you like little raptors testing the fence.  they’ll just start poking at you. it’s what people do. it’s natural. it’s just what people do. if you live with people that all are on at&t and you’re on verizon, they’re like, “dude, look at my bars. make the switch. come on over. what are you, a f*cking democrat, dude? libertarian is where it’s at. wake up! join us!” when you’re with all girls, they just start… they constantly f*ck with my manhood. it’s like, i’ll come home and some new thing is painted pink. i’m like, “why is this pink?” “it looks better pink, daddy.” “it looks better pink, daddy.” and my wife’s like, “i think they’re right.” i’m like, “oh… i see what the f*ck is going on here. it’s mutiny!” they just chip, chip, chip away. it’s like if my manhood was a mountain of marbles. every day they steal two. they just walk up to my stack… you can’t say shit. you can’t say shit, ’cause it’s only two marbles, and you’re like, “i still got all these marbles. everything is gonna be okay. i’ll deal with this eventually.” but you’re not gonna deal with it. every day, two more marbles. you never get those marbles back. you see it comin’. you don’t do anything about it. you’re like, “i gotta go to sleep. all right, everybody stop crying. i gotta go to sleep.” and men don’t want to admit that. “not me, bro. not me, bro. i’d rather just live in the woods by myself.” what are you, a f*cking coldplay song? huh? what are you, a character in a book, you piece of shit? no one’s honest. no one’s honest about how much we need other people. that’s why the characters that we adore so much in the movies are the people that don’t need people. the people who just walk away from it all, like, “wow, what a rebel!” but in real life, we need people so bad that the worst shit you can do to a prisoner is put them in solitary confinement. so think about that. you’re in a cement box filled with rapists and murderers. and the worst shit they can do is leave you alone. we’re f*cking weird. we are weird, ’cause what we are really is we’re some weird superorganism that, like, needs each other in some sort of strange way. but we’re all in denial. “i’m kind of a loner.” oh, shut the f*ck up. there’s no such thing. it’s not real. every person in this room, me included, all of us, we are all a calculation. we’re all an ongoing, on-running calculation of all the interactions you’ve ever had with all the people that you’ve ever met. and you do a bunch of things that people like, and start doing more of that. you’re like, “i’ll do more of that.” you find things that people don’t like, you’re like, “i’ll keep that shit to myself, hmm. i don’t like that feeling. hmm.” that’s what we do. that’s what we do. it’s weird. we don’t want to admit it. but that’s who we all are. and i’m just telling you this because i’ve never been more of a b*tch. right now, i have slowly but surely bent until i’m in this position. this is how i’m riding out my days, just like this. “okay, okay, okay, okay.” but i’m also telling you right now that i’m not going out like bruce jenner. oh! that’s right, politically correct san francisco. here’s my take on this bruce jenner thing. and, you know, everybody has their own… not really. this is what everybody’s take is. this is the take that you’re supposed to have. “he’s always been a woman trapped in a man’s body.” maybe. definitely maybe. definitely people are like that. definitely, there are people who were born in the wrong gender. and am i saying they should stay their gender? no. who gives a f*ck? you should do whatever you wanna do. you should be happy. you should be free. i don’t care what you do. but… it’s also possible that, maybe, if you live with crazy b*tches long enough, you become one. that’s all i’m saying. i don’t see this discussed. it is entirely possible. if you put a praying mantis on a leaf, it becomes the color of the leaf. why? because it wants to live. it wants to survive. it wants to be accepted by its environment. you show me a man who’s lived with the kardashians for ten years who didn’t come out a chick, and then we’ll have some data, okay? ‘cause right now, we lost a f*cking american olympian, and i want you to have some respect! we’re down bruce jenner. and i’ve got a close eye on kanye west, and i don’t exactly like what i’m seeing.  look at kanye west. he’s a very talented, young, heterosexual man who starts a clothing line… he’s clearly jealous about taylor swift, and he tweets like a coked-up stripper in the middle of the night. you don’t see what i’m seeing? we are watching the plot of a f*cking stephen king book play out! an american athletic hero moves in with a woman who’s made hundreds of millions of dollars through no way anyone can explain to anyone. he breaks up with her. she turns him into a chick. the whole world tells him he’s beautiful. you tell me you don’t see what i’m seeing? you have to say… you have to say she’s beautiful. “she’s beautiful.” she’s not beautiful, and neither am i. look, i look like a thumb with two thumbs. okay? you put me in a dress, i’d be even more disgusting. “beauty’s unusual.” there’s a lot of cool shit that isn’t beautiful. sixty-year-old dudes in skirts are on that list. jesus f*cking christ! what kind of games are we playing here? why are you lying to children? that’s beautiful. what are my kids gonna think when they see a mountain or a rose? “is that beautiful too, daddy? explain.” ahhh! bang! i can’t! the world’s gone f*cking bananas! “what you’re saying is horribly transphobic and incredibly regressive. you should be embarrassed at what you’re doing. you’re doing this just to get laughs at someone else’s expense.” maybe! or maybe bruce jenner lived with demons. maybe they waited by the bed… until they knew he was in heavy rem sleep… so they could assume their true form.  climb up and kick off their designer shoes to reveal black raven’s claws. clutched the edge of the bed and just… whispered in his ear.   “bruce…  we would like you better if you were one of us.” “ i can’t. i can’t be one of you. i was… i was born a man.” “nonsense!   nonsense. bruce… you no longer can be held prisoner by the gender of your birth. you’re free. bruce…  your lips are too thin… for the cover of vanity fair.” “huh? what? wait. wait. did you say the cover? okay. are you f*cking with me? because… you know the cover’s always been my dream.” “it can be real!  it can be real. all dreams… can be real through surgery. sleep.”  thank you very much, san francisco! i had a great f*cking time with you savages! let’s take a selfie. shit. we got it. putting together one of these f*cking specials is stressful as shit. i appreciate the f*ck out of all you people being here tonight. and i love you guys. thank you very much!   your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * \n",

            "   ladies and gentlemen welcome joe rogan  what the fck is going on san francisco thanks for coming i appreciate it god damn put your phone down fckface i see you btch put your phone down motherfckers they can’t use their eyes everybody’s gotta live through their goddamn phone whoo i’m high as fck whoo it’s strange i wasn’t sure if i was gonna do this sober i’m like “ugh…” it’s not the move not in san francisco this is… i love pot but the people that are making edibles need to slow the fck down oh my god what are you trying to do to people i had a pot gummy bear the other day i think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldn’t be able to steal your soul right how the fck are these people making these things man they’re not consistent that’s also part of the problem you don’t know what you’re getting ’cause they’re not making them the same place where they make tylenol nah it’s some greasy dude with a grateful dead tshirt on and a gray ponytail he’s got a bowl of ingredients and he can’t remember whether or not he put weed in yet this dude’s time traveling just back and forth he just keeps chucking weed in there until it looks like lawn trimmings you eat it and it’s not what you’re looking for it’s not regulated you gotta ask questions i asked a dude at the pot store i go “hey man how strong are the gummy bears” he goes… that’s not a unit of measurement he’s like “el diablo el diablo” “fck man how much should i take” “just the leg” “just the leg why are you selling whole bears what the fck are you trying to prove man” they just watch you leave with that bear they go “oh shit” they know they know you’re not gonna die you’re gonna think you’re gonna die but everybody lives learn some shit we learn some shit from the scary trips see the thing about edibles one of the problems with it being illegal is that a lot of us don’t have a lot of information that we could use like there’s a difference between smoking it and eating it when you smoke it you get thc but when you eat it it’s processed by your liver and it produces something called 11hydroxy metabolite that’s five times more psychoactive than thc and it lets you talk to dolphins  this is a real moment that changed my life i was in hawaii and we were on a boat and we were fishing we were pulling these lines behind the boat and i was so high i was trying to figure out which way the earth was spinning like the boat’s going this way and the sun’s up there i’m like “um…” for like 20 minutes i’m paralyzed so while this is all happening these dolphins just show up and if you’ve ever been around wild dolphins they’re very trippy it’s very different than you expect because they look at you they like check you out they like pop out of the water and they like look at you… like a person not like a fcking deer or woodchuck they look at you like another person granted i was so high i thought i was gonna die but… i’m making eye contact with these dolphins and i started thinking “how smart are these fcking things” because we’re fishing dolphins eat fish but you never catch dolphins ever no one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin and all i could think of while these dolphins were like hopping through the water and looking at us and shit… i was thinking “if people lived in the water you’d fcking catch ’em all day” they wouldn’t even have to live in the water if cheeseburgers just floated down geary street… at least once a week a guy would be like “i’m taking a chance” and you see ’em getting yanked up to the clouds “fck we lost billy” the bottom of his sneakers in a puff of cloud you don’t catch dolphins on fishhooks man that’s weird they’re around fishing all the time and like “btch” they’re fcking smart how smart well i watched a dolphin documentary and it said they have a cerebral cortex that’s 40 larger than a human being’s i don’t know what that means but if you say it right and don’t fck up the words it makes you sound smarter than you really are i think what it means is they have big fcking brains but we don’t think of them as being smart ’cause they don’t do what we do right they don’t send emails they don’t have houses but if you lived in their world you don’t need anything you don’t need your fingers no one’s typing they have a language that’s so complex we can’t understand it all the food’s free they stay where the water’s warm i started thinking “how fcking smart are they what if they’re exactly the same as us what if it’s just some different branch of evolution we went one way they went the other what if consciousness is the same” i was thinking “what if me to me is the same as me to a dolphin” the way you think of yourself when you say the word “me” i was like “what if that’s exactly how a dolphin feels they’re just living life through different biology different genetics different life experiences but if i lived a dolphin’s life i would be him and if he lived my life he would be me” and then i started thinking “what if that’s the case with people what if everyone is exactly the same we’re just living life through different bodies what if that’s the secret of happiness treat everyone as if it’s you living another life”  i mean… and then i thought “god damn how good is this weed i’m getting in california whoo i’m on a fcking floating craft out in the middle of the ocean talking to water people” the problem with treating everybody as if it’s you living another life is you wanna fcking smack yourself half the people you meet you just wanna fcking smack ’em we live in the weirdest time ever i mean it’s the most awesome time ever but it’s the weirdest time ever too we’re like that close to president trump  no boo “no boo” you boo but you won’t vote you fcks all those bernie sanders people “yo bernie’s the shit” “did you vote for him” “voting ain’t real bro it doesn’t even work dude” we are that close to president trump bill cosby’s a rapist and bruce jenner’s a chick we’re in an episode of lost down is up and up is down this is the type of world you get when you give kids participation trophies for getting their ass kicked in soccer games this is the world we get we get a goddamn nerfedup world filled with nonsense nobody wants to be president nobody i hope hillary wins that way we can realize chicks can’t do that fcking job either it’s a stupid job it’s a stupid job invented back when people used to write with feathers it’s dumb it’s just some oldschool shit that we need to get rid of it doesn’t make any sense being president is great if there’s like 50 people if there’s 50 people you can figure out which one’s the best three hundred million people i have three kids i don’t know where the fck they are right now how is this one dude in charge of 300 million people it’s nonsense it’s so old and stupid they make this guy sleep in this fcking white house if trump wins you know his house is cooler than the white house he’s like “i’m not sleeping in that shittyass stupid house” trump’s probably got like a tube at home that he opens up and a chinese girl just pops out of it and sucks his dick and goes right back in that’s what i would do if i had that kind of money we’re down to assholes where’s elon musk when you need him where’s the fcking geniuses where’s mark cuban no we got an old lady trying to get back at her husband for a blowjob he got in the ’90s we got an old man who hates money and we got a reality tv star with a plastic set of hair you can’t have a president with environmental concerns when every time this motherfcker does his hair we lose a foot of ozone layer and a polar bear bursts into flames he’s got like a closet full of aqua net at home you can’t pretend you don’t give a fck when you have that thing going on dude stop that the white house got broken into while obama was in office the first time in over 100 years that someone broke into the white house also the first time a girl was guarding the front door by herself “what are you trying to say that women can’t do everything men can do” exactly that’s exactly what i’m saying that seems sexist right people say “you’re sexist” no it’s not sexist here’s why it’s not sexist ‘cause men can’t even do everything men can do see there’s no physical equality folks that’s why we have the olympics ‘cause there’s people that can do some shit that you and i can’t do one of those things is guarding the fcking white house i know i can’t guard the white house you know how i know because i’ve met shaquille o’neal and his dick is where my face is that’s not equality that’s not white privilege listen if the white house is experiencing a shaq attack i’m the wrong dude to save the world i did fear factor with shaq if we’re holding hands it’d be like a sixyearold at the park with his dad we’re barely the same thing so do i think women should guard the white house no i don’t think i should either it’s not sexist to say that women can’t do big physical labor things as good as giant men can but people will tell you it is well i’m not sexist as a matter of fact my favorite people are all female i have a wife and i have three daughters they’re my favorite people in the world but i could beat the fck out of all of them okay listen… if they’re guarding the door i’m getting in i don’t mean to sound cocky but i’m just real confident i could fck them up if i had the flu okay yeah we’re different we’re different i could beat up my cat too i’m not proud of it i just tell you what’s up if you wanna bet money bet money on me i’ll fck that cat up most likely cats are fcking weird like that man i was petting my cat once and he bit me i was like “whoa are we gonna do this what the fck are you doing here” i got a little nervous got a little nervous “women can do everything men can do this guy’s a piece of shit we’re leaving too much information is going in that i don’t agree with” “what the guy said was total bullshit total bullshit” how’d that girl get that job i’ll tell you how that girl got that job because someone let her have that job which means either there were a bunch of guys that were trying to fck her… or her boss was a chick and she hated her either one’s possible look if there was a bunch of guys that were trying to fck her that makes total sense if there’s one hot girl and she’s working with five guys in an office no work’s getting done in that office that office is now just an audition to see which guy gets to fck her each one of those guys will just slowly start to morph to figure out what this girl likes men become like an octopus that tries to fit its way through a keyhole “there’s gotta be a fcking way there’s gotta be a fcking way” you got this girl who’s like “i could guard the front door” “oh you could definitely guard the door no doubt no doubt” and over time if this woman doesn’t sleep with one of these men and claim him over time these guys will just start morphing and they’ll just start saying ridiculous preposterous shit “debbie wants to guard the front door do you have a problem with that” “no i don’t as a matter of fact i think women are amazing plus i’m vegan” and they will just… they will wear patchouli they will do what the fck they have to do next thing you know poor fcking debbie at the front door… “why am i alone”  the whole story is so bananas and it’s one of my favorite stories so i’m gonna give you the whole story of the breakin at the white house with no edits and no comic exaggerations this is the real story ‘cause a lot of people think there’s some grand conspiracy there’s some cabal of evil geniuses that’s pulling the strings on everyone in america it’s most likely that people are just dumb as fck in all sorts of walks of life this is the story this is the real story about the person who broke into the white house first of all people are always worried “the government’s checking out my emails bro the government’s watching us all the time” they pulled this guy over two months before he broke into the white house he had four handguns two rifles and a machete with him they didn’t even watch him he had a map on the map was washington and it had an “x” where the white house is they’re like “you’re good to go” they let him go two months later this motherfcker broke into the white house and why did he break into the white house why do you break into the white house ever because you want to die you don’t… that’s like a suicide run that’s the only reason why someone runs toward the white house if you had to ask someone “what kind of security do you think they have at the white house” “oh dude… they got snipers on every corner they got lasers in the grass if you get too far they open up a door you drop right into jail” nope turns out they don’t even have a dog you just fcking run the guy who made it into the white house he had 800 rounds of ammunition in his car left that there took a knife that’s a guy who wants to die he’s just sitting in his fcking car going “fck the government fck my exwife and fck everybody i’m gonna do this fck you” just sprinting “oh my god i’m doing it oh my god i’m doing it” thinking with every step “this is gonna be the last step of my life no this is gonna be the last step of my life no this…” and he gets to the front door it’s unlocked he opens it there’s a girl there by herself smacks her to the ground and just starts running through the hall ah he’s probably going “why am i alive” he’s probably thinking… he was inside for minutes for minutes running around he got tackled by an offduty officer he was probably thinking “i wanted to die i don’t want to go to fcking jail will somebody please shoot me” then he was probably pissed “where are my tax dollars going what kind of security are you fcking people running in this place” \n",
            "imagine when obama found out a girl was guarding him he was probably like “everybody everybody not that much diversity i mean what are you playing fcking fairy tale games here” obama’s got a hard job ’cause he’s the first president that’s ever been around while google was here you know he could google his own name if he gets crazy in the middle of the night right “so let me see what the people have to say” he’d just go “obama is a…”  “i’m none of those fcking things” freakin’ out shit  probably thinking “why the fck did i do this” i think the guy who broke into the white house and obama probably have a lot in common in that… they went for it but they probably never really thought they were getting in there you can’t quit once you’re the president the moment obama actually got into office like “good morning mr president” he was probably like “oh no what the fck did i do this for i didn’t think i was actually gonna get in  i can’t sleep i’m freaking out everybody wants to kill me  who the fck is guarding me” looks out in the hallway there’s a girl taking selfies that’d be the greatest selfie of all time a girl with her ass out duck lips in the background a dude’s breaking into the white house  you know i’m not making this up you’ve all seen this this is recognizable pigeontoed is a good move ’cause you can’t get away that good you just like… like there’s something wrong with your back that’s a recognizable pose when did that start ‘cause if you look at the original pictures back when people first invented pictures everybody just stood there looking hungry like if you saw a photo from the 1800s and in the background a girl was going… she’s a fcking time traveler nobody knew that move back then somebody had to see their face “oh people like that they like what i’m doing” combo a twohole combo attractor it’s all over online it gets you a lot of likes i saw a gal on instagram she has eight million followers all she does is take pictures of her ass that’s it she’s got a winning formula she sticks with it no witty memes there’s no inspirational quotes mnhmnh mnhmnh just a lot of this different ways and she’s just a regular girl man i’m watching this i’m like “this is a different kind of person” she has eight million people that have no idea what her voice sounds like she doesn’t have a job that they like she doesn’t have an occupation that they follow they’re just staring at her ass this is a new kind of human there’s never been a person psychologically that’s had to navigate those kind of waters if you really stop and think about it science should really step in and start looking at this don’t go to south america to study some new frog that nobody gives a fck about there’s a girl in florida with eight million people staring at her ass how does this girl keep a relationship what is her day like how many dick pics does she get sent how many dick pics does that girl receive on a daily basis is it like the national debt counter was just fcking spinning out of control constantly i bet if she turns on the notifications her phone just starts screaming and runs away from her i bet if she deletes all the dick pics from her phone it would be physically lighter this is a new kind of person we really have to understand there’s never been a person like this before and she’s just a person like that kind of influence that kind of attractant that’s a very strong drug to have in the hands of just a girl and as a guy who has daughters i just think of that like that’s kind of fcking… that’s weird because this girl has eight million people staring at her ass eight million creeps and weirdos and perverts objectifying her i mean i follow her but i’m not like those other assholes i’m different i care i care about who she is i’m a nice person i’m a hero or something  “i’m different those other guys are assholes men are noble men are noble and true” mmm if we get to come if men don’t get to come we get real sméagollike real quick just a few months of no dates  “mesus is just so disappointed with all the mens mesus meets mesus is so embarrassed at how other mens talks to you mmm oh” everyone wants to set themselves up as being the noble one everybody wants to be matthew mcconaughey to save the world on a rocket ship there’s people that are signing up to go to mars do you know about this there’s a mission to mars a manned mission to mars where 200000 people have signed up to be amongst the four people to die on mars they’re gonna take a oneway trip to mars that’s some sad shit for a bunch of reasons first of all it’s some sad shit ’cause that’s 200000 people that don’t have any real friends right if it’s someone you love your real friend… if one of my friends is gonna move to florida i’ll be like “btch where the fck are you going you’re gonna go to florida we can’t hang out if you go to florida why the fck are you moving to florida man” but you might be able to deal with it “we can just visit each other every now and then” but if your friend was gonna move to mars you’d be like “oh really get in the fcking car just get in the car dude” take him out to death valley “look around sucks right mars sucks worse get back in the car stupid” jesus christ there’s places in america you can’t live man you don’t wanna live in detroit why the fck are you talking about moving to mars people really consider moving to mars it’s one of the dumbest ideas ever but if you say that people will ecobro you have you ever been ecobroed these people will find an opportunity to virtue signal over you as michael shermer likes to point out like puff their chest out and say that they’re probably better than you “hey dude seriously you think there’s something wrong with going to mars well i don’t know if you’ve paid attention man we maybe should colonize mars ’cause california’s almost out of water” then he’ll nod like “yeah btch” we’re right next to the ocean what the fck are you talking about look at all that water you fly over it it takes a day the world’s blue it’s more water than it is not water we have a salt problem we don’t have a water problem suck the salt out of the water we got a goddamn party instead of pissing and moaning… “too complicated bro we gotta go to neptune” oh my god you’re fcking crazy we’re a crazy race filled with crazy people we’re like a dude with a dirty house like “man i gotta build a new house” no you gotta stop shitting in your kitchen stop piling up newspapers you’re never gonna read in front of your bathroom you fck we’re crazy oneway trip to mars a oneway trip in coach with three other people so fcking stupid they’re willing to die on mars with you great what great conversation you’re gonna have it’s nonsense folks my friend was like “they’re not gonna die on mars man if people are smart enough to figure out how to get to mars they’re smart enough to figure out how to get back” here’s why that doesn’t make any sense people smart enough to get to mars aren’t going see that’s the dirty secret about rocket travel ladies and gentlemen nobody smart enough to make a rocket ever gets in one of those fcking things no no they look at each other right before the launch and they go… they talk german and they get behind giant fcking concrete bunkers they take some squarejawed cornfed dude from the middle of the country tuck a bible under that dude’s arm and strap him into that giant metal dick and shoot it off into the heavens that’s what we do and that is what that is that is a metal dick it’s a robot dick and we’re trying to fck the sky we are literally trying to come people out of the tip of a metal dick onto other planets our ultimate goal is that we get those planets pregnant and they’re too filled up with people and then they gotta make a new metal dick “bro we gotta go to jupiter” then they make another one they shoot that fcking thing and they fill jupiter up we just keep filling the cosmos up with people and we never evolve and we never change we stay perfect like we are right now who’s in you’re gonna all come with me we’re gonna leave here right now and go to the church of scientology right down the street and it’s all gonna make sense when you find out that you are an eternal being that created reality so that you can enjoy it i watched that hbo documentary a couple too many times i went clear i think i think i’m clear i’m back i’m back now if you haven’t seen…  i had to watch going clear a scientology documentary ’cause i have a neighbor who’s a scientologist and i don’t even think he’s gay i don’t know what the fck’s going on  but he sleeps really close to me you know like my bed’s here this fcking dude’s bed’s like over there his house is… i mean if you take away the walls he’s fcking right there it’s like “what does this crazy fck believe” and scientology is a wonderful religion not just because it was written by a science fiction author who wrote more fake shit than anyone that’s ever walked the face of the earth and not by a small amount this dude never made a second draft in his fcking life everything was one draft of nonsense and he wrote more of it than anybody not in his neighborhood not in his state not in a year not in a decade more than anyone that’s ever lived ever and scientology is still like “i don’t see any red flags i think we’re good i think this is legit as fck” if scientology is a good religion it’s because other religions get to make fun of ’em it’s like it’s the one religion that even the mormons are like “btch you believe what hold on i mean at least we don’t have video of joseph smith there’s some fcking shitty black and white footage of l ron hubbard with a captain’s outfit on you wanna explain that  why does he have all those awards on why is tom cruise wearing a gold medal the size of a dinner plate what the fck is going on with you people” i watched it with my mom and it was like… first of all scientology they don’t pay taxes that’s disturbing they’re taxfree which means they’re a recognized religion by the government of the united states which means the government of the united states had to go over what they believe and went “everything seems in order none of this shit seems like a cult” well what the fck is a cult and what’s a religion so i had to look it up turns out… i don’t know who wrote this but it’s a perfect definition a cult is bullshit it’s created by one person that person knows it’s bullshit in a religion that dude’s dead so it’s a religion ’cause l ron hubbard’s dead so i guess they got it on a loophole i watched it with my mom and my mom was like “i can’t believe anybody would fall for that” “you made me go to catholic school the fck are you talking about there was a child molester dressed like a sorcerer sitting on a golden throne and you made me call him father slow your roll lady” imagine if i talked to my mom like that oh my god jokes folks just jokes i don’t have a problem with people being religious because i just think life itself is too openended it’s too confusing and i think we’re evolving and part of our struggle in evolving is unanswered questions we wanna seek these answers but in the meanwhile they just give you so much anxiety and it fcks with you so much there’s nothing wrong with joining a cult i think you gotta just join a nice friendly one like the mormons are a good cult here’s why they don’t get mad at anybody like they never kill anybody like here’s a perfect example matt stone and trey parker the guys who created south park they made a hilarious musical called the book of mormon it’s fantastic if you haven’t seen it it’s so fcking hilarious but it’s also brutal brutal about the mormons you know what the mormons did they went to see it and they took out a fullpage ad in the playbill it said “if you enjoyed this musical and you wanna find out more about being a mormon please visit our website” they just took it right on the chin like champs they didn’t get mad they didn’t get defensive they didn’t kill anybody that’s a good cult they just said “what do you wanna do” “we got nine wives shut the fck up” “everybody just… everybody just chill just chill” that’s a good religion that’s a good cult some cults aren’t that good they get fcking testy you know the one we don’t have to say who you know what i’m talking about there’s that one that will kill you if you draw their guy “come on man i can’t even draw your dude what if i draw a dude drawing your dude” “no loopholes” “fckin’ relax bro” and this isn’t just theoretical people have died ’cause they made cartoons before the most recent paris attacks there was a magazine called charlie hebdo and they were attacked where 11 cartoonists were killed eleven more were wounded and they killed a cop too fcking crazy over cartoons and when you… when there’s radical crazy people in the world what’s interesting is the reaction to radical crazy people and how everything just sort of kind of balances itself out when things get weird because when these people got killed over a cartoon the whole world was in shock the whole world was outraged but one of the scariest things about it was nobody wanted to print those pictures you couldn’t see ’em in the la times you couldn’t find them in time magazine you had to go online and find them it was a dark moment for free speech because everybody’s like “oh i don’t wanna get killed i don’t wanna show the pictures” it was weird until… the balance because after they got killed and nobody wanted to print the pictures word got back to texas… where they promptly held a “draw muhammad” contest in garland texas i’m not making a word of this up you can google it and i’ll wait they had a “draw muhammad” contest in garland texas two dudes showed up started shooting at the building they were killed almost instantly why because they were at a “draw muhammad” contest in texas how obvious does a trap have to be before you start getting suspicious what are you livin’ in a wile e coyote cartoon motherfcker you ever go to texas that’s not santa monica btch that’s a totally different kind of white people those are some wild west people that have computers and modern guns they’re not supposed to be there people didn’t evolve in texas it’s not like they were monkeys then they became people and they stayed in that spot no no they landed on boats on the east coast the stubborn ones stayed the smart ones made it to california but along the way we lost a bunch of people  and some of them just stuck around “y’all go ahead we’re gonna hang back here i’m gonna draw the biggest dick the world’s ever seen in the sand my wife’s got the biggest titties i’mma try to fck a snake i think it can be done” they just stayed they just gathered cattle stockpiled ammo and they all talk alike and that’s why you gotta be nervous you gotta be nervous in places with accents okay it’s one of the reasons why i can prove that california is the best spot to live ‘cause all the spots that suck they all have to sound like each other ‘cause i grew up in a place like that i grew up in boston it’s not that the people in boston suck but the weather sucks it’s fcking horrible and in the winter everybody gets in their car in the morning and just goes “fck fck fck fck fck fck fck fck fck fck” and everybody’s worried about… it’s a real possibility you might starve to death one day you might freeze trying to walk home  so they all talk in the same way “oh my god how many more months till summer ahhh when is this fcking winter gonna be over we need more firewood”  they have to sound like the people around them so if other people invade like “we stick together we’re all in this together” that’s how they are in texas too they’re like “y’all ain’t from around here are ya” they have a fcking certain way of talking which is proof positive why california is the best spot try making fun of a california accent what are you gonna do speak clear and concise what are you gonna do you gonna mock us you’re gonna say some shit that everybody understands they’re not supposed to be in texas folks it’s not even a state it’s a republic they were like “man we ain’t so sure about this whole united states thing we’re gonna hang back hang back see how this plays out” they don’t have any rules they have like three pages of rule books here’s how i know this i’m gonna tell you a fact a fact about texas that will change the way you think about texas there are more tigers in captivity in texas in private collections than there are in all of the wild of the world i’m gonna repeat it because i know you’re like “oh the fear factor guy is just making shit up to make his jokes work” no there’s more tigers in dudes’ yards in texas than the rest of the fcking planet how is that possible because they can because they went through the rule book…  “it don’t say shit about tigers order it up dude order it up dude” one guy got a tiger and his neighbor’s like “shit i didn’t know we could get tigers” and he got two tigers and the first guy was like “i ain’t about to let this faggot outtiger me” and he opened up tiger world with his oil money we’re gonna need those people folks if the russians invade we can’t make fcking warrior babies with those chicks in marin county with fake asses and rubber lips okay we’re gonna need some real warrior genes we’re gonna need some women who wear nonironic daisy dukes they got cowboy boots with no socks and stinky feet and they yell out “chris kyle rest in peace” when you make ’em come we need those women if the russians come we gotta be ready think about the children think about the children while i get a sip this is super important ladies and gentlemen a lot of people are sleeping on…  imagine if i had real points oh jesus christ  i love you fckers too man so excited to be here  i have kids and i lie to them i get high around ’em too people say you shouldn’t do that but they don’t see it they say you shouldn’t be intoxicated around your children well i’m not i’m high i call it “elevated” it’s a different thing the people who have a problem with that they don’t understand what getting high is like they think you’re gonna be to your kid like “who are you” what do you think what’s the worst thing that can happen if i’m a little high around my kid they’re gonna get extra hugs and daddy’s going to be paranoid about objects “look out don’t go there” that’s it plus i have cool conversations i have a sixyearold daughter man there’s not a lot of 48yearold man and 6yearold girl have in common other than the fact she’s my daughter and so our conversations are normally pretty boring but when i’m high i’m like “you know you call that thing your baby your doll you call it your baby but you know it’s not a baby right” “yeah i know it’s not a baby” “do you call it a baby because you’re the youngest and you like having someone who is responsible for you” “maybe” “okay that’s cool that’s cool give me a hug i love you”  it’s weird man it’s weird raising little people there’s some things that i didn’t expect one of the things i didn’t expect is you have to lie to them like you don’t have to lie to them about a lot of things but you have to lie to them about santa claus it’s just one of those things man ’cause it’s like a community you have to think about what your kid’s gonna tell other kids because when it comes to santa claus you don’t want your kid to be one of two things you don’t want your kid to be the first kid that tells everyone that santa claus is bullshit ’cause that kid’s an asshole but you don’t want your kid to be the last kid that figures out that santa claus is bullshit ’cause that kid’s a moron so you got… you got a little bit of… you’re like “oh no when do we do this when do we do this” and no one knows when to do it you just let the kids figure it out then they’re like “dad what the fck” you’re like “aw… oh i missed the boat i missed the boat” nobody knows when to do it nobody can be honest about it they have little meetings and shit and i’m like “when do we tell ’em” this lady goes “when they’re 11” they’re gonna be fcking by then i told her it was funny she didn’t believe me i’m like “oh i’m sorry i’m off by a year” that’s not as funny but it’s… i didn’t mean it but it’s this thing they want to keep the kids in the dark and they wanna pretend they’re the only one that’s teaching the kid this is a weird thing that people do they’re like “i teach my kids man i teach my kids” “eh… when you see ’em” but unless you’re some freak who homeschools your children in the forest your kid’s gonna go to school they’re gonna go to school and they’re gonna be in a class with 50 other kids the teacher only makes 20 bucks a year and she’s thinking about dick that’s all she’s thinking about she’s thinking about getting stuffed she’s a young fertile woman who loves kids and she’s writing on that chalkboard and the kids all huddle up and share information like “yeah what did your dad tell you your dad tell you that yeah my dad says santa claus is fcking bullshit okay you ever go near a chimney it’s that big what the fck teacher’s coming play with blocks act stupid uh how does this work” they play dumb they play dumb they’re like little prisoners trying to figure their way out they make little papiermâché heads and pretend they’re napping they’re little humans they wanna run shit “who is these people telling us what to do are they being straight with us man what the fck is going on” i knew the day my daughter knew that santa claus is bullshit she came home stared me down she was like maddogging me she took her book bag and just goes…  walked right up to the chimney looking at me “how the fck” “dad have you ever met santa claus” “no honey i’ve never met him” “but you let him in the house” and there’s this moment… it was a moment where a sevenyearold has you at checkmate you’re like “oh shit” i don’t know whether to highfive her or to keep lying you wanna go “yeah you got me you got me you got me that’s bullshit no the big bang is real but this is bullshit” the big bang sounds even less real the problem is you have to be consistent if you’re teaching your kids nonsense you gotta teach ’em only nonsense you can’t mix nonsense in with like real stuff like my daughter will go like “how do birds fly” i go “birds have bones that are hollow so they’re really light then they have feathers which cover a large surface area and they use the hollow bones and the feathers to push down on the air see the air looks like it’s nothing right but it’s actually a bunch of gases that’s why the trees move when the wind blows the birds can manipulate that and go through 3d space” “whoa” “yeah nature is crazy” “yeah how does the fat man get through the little hole” “magic christmas magic now go to bed i’m trying to fck your mom go to bed”  jokes folks just jokes can’t talk like that that’s how you make strippers you gotta be nice they’re little tiny people they’re adorable they don’t know anything yet you gotta teach ’em everything you can’t talk mean  kids are a lot like really fcking stupid people… in that if you get ten really stupid people in a room the most confident one just starts running shit they don’t have to have any more information they just have to be more confident if you get a bunch of dummies together they’re like “i don’t know what’s going on” “i don’t know what’s going on” “i fcking do i fcking do” the guy doesn’t have to have any extra data he just has to be the only one that’s confident and that’s what it’s like in school my daughter’s class has this fcking kid named debbie and every day it’s “debbie says…” oh fcking debbie says debbie says what you don’t think about that before you have kids not only are you gonna have kids but your kids are gonna make friends and then you have to make friends with the fcking parents of your kids and some of ’em are crazy my daughter’s like “debbie says adam and eve are the only two people in the world and all people came from them is that true”  and this is weird like you don’t know what to do right you want to be diplomatic you don’t want to cause problems at school but you gotta be honest and one of the most difficult things to say to a kid is “i don’t know” i’m like “sweetie i don’t know i don’t know if adam and eve is where people came from but nobody knows because no one from today is alive back then so it’s not something you can measure so it’s not something you can see so we don’t know but here’s what we do know you know how some people have big ears and some people have little ears” “yeah” “well some people have brains that are made out of dog shit and they get horny too and what happens is they have to find someone even dumber than them to have sex with it’s like the opposite of evolution and then they have a kid and their kid is fcked their kid is fcked and everybody wants to pretend it’s a level playing field there’s no level anywhere you look is an eagle and a salmon level does the salmon ever get to eat the eagle no the universe does not want even it wants conflict and resolution and constant improvement okay i’m gonna shut this light out and i’m gonna go fck your mom right in the mouth all right” i don’t say these things i don’t say any of these things i was like “i don’t know maybe debbie’s right doesn’t make sense to me how would that work” “how would that work” “it wouldn’t work would it” adam and eve are the only two people they have kids and then where do all the other people come from i guess the kids just start fcking each other is that what happens mom fcks the kids or the… yeah exactly debbie’s parents they were at my house man for a cookout and the dude told me the earth’s 10000 years old they’re young earth christians they’re sweet people by the way before i shit on them… i’m gonna shit on them but before i shit on them they’re sweet they’re really nice people i hug ’em every time i see ’em they’re really kind nice people but they just found a part of their brain they’re like “i have no use for this”  chucked that whole logic discerningreason part “this fcking thing’s confusing” they’re young earth christians which means they follow the strictest interpretation of the bible possible i’m like “how many people believe the earth is less than 10000 years old” uh i looked it up there’s a recent gallup poll that said that 46 of america believes the earth is less than 10000 years old  here’s why you shouldn’t be scared they can only measure people dumb enough to answer polls and when you factor that in you’re talking about a really small number ‘cause you know what the average response is if you call people up and say “how old’s the earth” number one answer is “older than your mother’s pussy” and then they hang up number two answer is “fck you” after that you start throwing numbers around and only 46 of those dummies were stupid enough to think the earth is 10000 years old that’s debbie’s fcking parents so out of the people that answer polls… is it even 1 it might be 1 only 46 are that fcking stupid and that’s the 1 we should really be worried about we’re worried about the wrong 1 not that we shouldn’t be worried about the really rich greedy people we definitely should we should definitely worry about bankers and people who… they’re just stockpiling resources they could help the world in some really impossible ways for anybody else but they don’t they’d rather just pile up their gold  yeah that 1 is awful but there’s another 1 that freaks me the fck out that no one’s talking about that’s the 1 who leave comments on youtube videos who the fck are those freaks could you imagine people talking to each other like that in real life and not beating the shit out of each other i mean if jesus christ himself came back from the dead and had a youtube page the first comment would be “you ain’t shit without your dad pussy” these are monsters this is not a normal person’s response normal people don’t leave comments what a normal person does they watch a video they like it or they don’t like it that’s it it ends right there but what you’re dealing with is the process of racism and child abuse and neglect and shitty genes and the insane clown posse is playing they know all the words and they’re wafting up their farts and their cheez doodle fingers and like “an open letter to jennifer lopez… let me pause and just jerk off in my shirt real quick here  ugh… dear jennifer don’t you think it’s about time you dress a little more classy what are your children gonna see when they see…” just fcking think of the meanest most biting shit that’s gonna cut it as if jennifer lopez has time in between eating diamonds and fcking all her background dancers in a castle that she built with her ass but you know “let me check the youtube comments to see if my selfesteem’s on point oh” and you know who’s dumber than them me ‘cause i read their shit and i get mad i know they’re stupid i still get upset fck this is the world folks this is the world we’re living in are we happy i’m not sure is this what we wanted i don’t know  no no  no are you sure  no why are you doing this what is this what are you doing are you fighting for freedom what’s happening  no are you white panthers what is this  life sucks what are you saying  life can kind of suck sometimes life can kind of suck maybe it’s how you’re livin’ it btch “life can kind of suck” it’s the greatest time ever to be alive “yeah i’d live in the old days when you could die from crabs” it doesn’t get any better than today man so stupid “make america great again” it’s as good as it’s ever been what the fck are you saying we have 4g everywhere when has it been better we have netflix when has it been better come on man stop it’s never been better this is as good as it’s ever been it’s just weird it’s just weird you gotta get your shit together btch don’t blame the world god damn it damn it man and listen if you’ve seen any of this show and you said “i think some of the stuff you’re saying is really funny but i sense a lot of like macho posturing from you i sense a lot of like bullshit toughguy stuff” you’re totally correct and what it is is i live with all women okay and i’m becoming more of a btch every day of my life and i just wanna say i’m not unhappy i’ve never been more happy in my life this is the happiest i’ve ever been but when you’re with all girls like you have all girls all the time you have to make little compromises you don’t think about it while it’s happening it’s like the rock doesn’t think about the water carving a path through it but eventually that fcking path is gonna get deep and when you’re with all people that are different than you they just go “hmm…” they just start looking at you like little raptors testing the fence  they’ll just start poking at you it’s what people do it’s natural it’s just what people do if you live with people that all are on att and you’re on verizon they’re like “dude look at my bars make the switch come on over what are you a fcking democrat dude libertarian is where it’s at wake up join us” when you’re with all girls they just start… they constantly fck with my manhood it’s like i’ll come home and some new thing is painted pink i’m like “why is this pink” “it looks better pink daddy” “it looks better pink daddy” and my wife’s like “i think they’re right” i’m like “oh… i see what the fck is going on here it’s mutiny” they just chip chip chip away it’s like if my manhood was a mountain of marbles every day they steal two they just walk up to my stack… you can’t say shit you can’t say shit ’cause it’s only two marbles and you’re like “i still got all these marbles everything is gonna be okay i’ll deal with this eventually” but you’re not gonna deal with it every day two more marbles you never get those marbles back you see it comin’ you don’t do anything about it you’re like “i gotta go to sleep all right everybody stop crying i gotta go to sleep” and men don’t want to admit that “not me bro not me bro i’d rather just live in the woods by myself” what are you a fcking coldplay song huh what are you a character in a book you piece of shit no one’s honest no one’s honest about how much we need other people that’s why the characters that we adore so much in the movies are the people that don’t need people the people who just walk away from it all like “wow what a rebel” but in real life we need people so bad that the worst shit you can do to a prisoner is put them in solitary confinement so think about that you’re in a cement box filled with rapists and murderers and the worst shit they can do is leave you alone we’re fcking weird we are weird ’cause what we are really is we’re some weird superorganism that like needs each other in some sort of strange way but we’re all in denial “i’m kind of a loner” oh shut the fck up there’s no such thing it’s not real every person in this room me included all of us we are all a calculation we’re all an ongoing onrunning calculation of all the interactions you’ve ever had with all the people that you’ve ever met and you do a bunch of things that people like and start doing more of that you’re like “i’ll do more of that” you find things that people don’t like you’re like “i’ll keep that shit to myself hmm i don’t like that feeling hmm” that’s what we do that’s what we do it’s weird we don’t want to admit it but that’s who we all are and i’m just telling you this because i’ve never been more of a btch right now i have slowly but surely bent until i’m in this position this is how i’m riding out my days just like this “okay okay okay okay” but i’m also telling you right now that i’m not going out like bruce jenner oh that’s right politically correct san francisco here’s my take on this bruce jenner thing and you know everybody has their own… not really this is what everybody’s take is this is the take that you’re supposed to have “he’s always been a woman trapped in a man’s body” maybe definitely maybe definitely people are like that definitely there are people who were born in the wrong gender and am i saying they should stay their gender no who gives a fck you should do whatever you wanna do you should be happy you should be free i don’t care what you do but… it’s also possible that maybe if you live with crazy btches long enough you become one that’s all i’m saying i don’t see this discussed it is entirely possible if you put a praying mantis on a leaf it becomes the color of the leaf why because it wants to live it wants to survive it wants to be accepted by its environment you show me a man who’s lived with the kardashians for ten years who didn’t come out a chick and then we’ll have some data okay ‘cause right now we lost a fcking american olympian and i want you to have some respect we’re down bruce jenner and i’ve got a close eye on kanye west and i don’t exactly like what i’m seeing  look at kanye west he’s a very talented young heterosexual man who starts a clothing line… he’s clearly jealous about taylor swift and he tweets like a cokedup stripper in the middle of the night you don’t see what i’m seeing we are watching the plot of a fcking stephen king book play out an american athletic hero moves in with a woman who’s made hundreds of millions of dollars through no way anyone can explain to anyone he breaks up with her she turns him into a chick the whole world tells him he’s beautiful you tell me you don’t see what i’m seeing you have to say… you have to say she’s beautiful “she’s beautiful” she’s not beautiful and neither am i look i look like a thumb with two thumbs okay you put me in a dress i’d be even more disgusting “beauty’s unusual” there’s a lot of cool shit that isn’t beautiful sixtyyearold dudes in skirts are on that list jesus fcking christ what kind of games are we playing here why are you lying to children that’s beautiful what are my kids gonna think when they see a mountain or a rose “is that beautiful too daddy explain” ahhh bang i can’t the world’s gone fcking bananas “what you’re saying is horribly transphobic and incredibly regressive you should be embarrassed at what you’re doing you’re doing this just to get laughs at someone else’s expense” maybe or maybe bruce jenner lived with demons maybe they waited by the bed… until they knew he was in heavy rem sleep… so they could assume their true form  climb up and kick off their designer shoes to reveal black raven’s claws clutched the edge of the bed and just… whispered in his ear   “bruce…  we would like you better if you were one of us” “ i can’t i can’t be one of you i was… i was born a man” “nonsense   nonsense bruce… you no longer can be held prisoner by the gender of your birth you’re free bruce…  your lips are too thin… for the cover of vanity fair” “huh what wait wait did you say the cover okay are you fcking with me because… you know the cover’s always been my dream” “it can be real  it can be real all dreams… can be real through surgery sleep”  thank you very much san francisco i had a great fcking time with you savages let’s take a selfie shit we got it putting together one of these fcking specials is stressful as shit i appreciate the fck

            "   ladies and gentlemen welcome joe rogan  what the fck is going on san francisco thanks for coming i appreciate it god damn put your phone down fckface i see you btch put your phone down motherfckers they can’t use their eyes everybody’s gotta live through their goddamn phone whoo i’m high as fck whoo it’s strange i wasn’t sure if i was gonna do this sober i’m like “ugh…” it’s not the move not in san francisco this is… i love pot but the people that are making edibles need to slow the fck down oh my god what are you trying to do to people i had a pot gummy bear the other day i think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldn’t be able to steal your soul right how the fck are these people making these things man they’re not consistent that’s also part of the problem you don’t know what you’re getting ’cause they’re not making them the same place where they make tylenol nah it’s some greasy dude with a grateful dead tshirt on and a gray ponytail he’s got a bowl of ingredients and he can’t remember whether or not he put weed in yet this dude’s time traveling just back and forth he just keeps chucking weed in there until it looks like lawn trimmings you eat it and it’s not what you’re looking for it’s not regulated you gotta ask questions i asked a dude at the pot store i go “hey man how strong are the gummy bears” he goes… that’s not a unit of measurement he’s like “el diablo el diablo” “fck man how much should i take” “just the leg” “just the leg why are you selling whole bears what the fck are you trying to prove man” they just watch you leave with that bear they go “oh shit” they know they know you’re not gonna die you’re gonna think you’re gonna die but everybody lives learn some shit we learn some shit from the scary trips see the thing about edibles one of the problems with it being illegal is that a lot of us don’t have a lot of information that we could use like there’s a difference between smoking it and eating it when you smoke it you get thc but when you eat it it’s processed by your liver and it produces something called  metabolite that’s five times more psychoactive than thc and it lets you talk to dolphins  this is a real moment that changed my life i was in hawaii and we were on a boat and we were fishing we were pulling these lines behind the boat and i was so high i was trying to figure out which way the earth was spinning like the boat’s going this way and the sun’s up there i’m like “um…” for like  minutes i’m paralyzed so while this is all happening these dolphins just show up and if you’ve ever been around wild dolphins they’re very trippy it’s very different than you expect because they look at you they like check you out they like pop out of the water and they like look at you… like a person not like a fcking deer or woodchuck they look at you like another person granted i was so high i thought i was gonna die but… i’m making eye contact with these dolphins and i started thinking “how smart are these fcking things” because we’re fishing dolphins eat fish but you never catch dolphins ever no one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin and all i could think of while these dolphins were like hopping through the water and looking at us and shit… i was thinking “if people lived in the water you’d fcking catch ’em all day” they wouldn’t even have to live in the water if cheeseburgers just floated down geary street… at least once a week a guy would be like “i’m taking a chance” and you see ’em getting yanked up to the clouds “fck we lost billy” the bottom of his sneakers in a puff of cloud you don’t catch dolphins on fishhooks man that’s weird they’re around fishing all the time and like “btch” they’re fcking smart how smart well i watched a dolphin documentary and it said they have a cerebral cortex that’s  larger than a human being’s i don’t know what that means but if you say it right and don’t fck up the words it makes you sound smarter than you really are i think what it means is they have big fcking brains but we don’t think of them as being smart ’cause they don’t do what we do right they don’t send emails they don’t have houses but if you lived in their world you don’t need anything you don’t need your fingers no one’s typing they have a language that’s so complex we can’t understand it all the food’s free they stay where the water’s warm i started thinking “how fcking smart are they what if they’re exactly the same as us what if it’s just some different branch of evolution we went one way they went the other what if consciousness is the same” i was thinking “what if me to me is the same as me to a dolphin” the way you think of yourself when you say the word “me” i was like “what if that’s exactly how a dolphin feels they’re just living life through different biology different genetics different life experiences but if i lived a dolphin’s life i would be him and if he lived my life he would be me” and then i started thinking “what if that’s the case with people what if everyone is exactly the same we’re just living life through different bodies what if that’s the secret of happiness treat everyone as if it’s you living another life”  i mean… and then i thought “god damn how good is this weed i’m getting in california whoo i’m on a fcking floating craft out in the middle of the ocean talking to water people” the problem with treating everybody as if it’s you living another life is you wanna fcking smack yourself half the people you meet you just wanna fcking smack ’em we live in the weirdest time ever i mean it’s the most awesome time ever but it’s the weirdest time ever too we’re like that close to president trump  no boo “no boo” you boo but you won’t vote you fcks all those bernie sanders people “yo bernie’s the shit” “did you vote for him” “voting ain’t real bro it doesn’t even work dude” we are that close to president trump bill cosby’s a rapist and bruce jenner’s a chick we’re in an episode of lost down is up and up is down this is the type of world you get when you give kids participation trophies for getting their ass kicked in soccer games this is the world we get we get a goddamn nerfedup world filled with nonsense nobody wants to be president nobody i hope hillary wins that way we can realize chicks can’t do that fcking job either it’s a stupid job it’s a stupid job invented back when people used to write with feathers it’s dumb it’s just some oldschool shit that we need to get rid of it doesn’t make any sense being president is great if there’s like  people if there’s  people you can figure out which one’s the best three hundred million people i have three kids i don’t know where the fck they are right now how is this one dude in charge of  million people it’s nonsense it’s so old and stupid they make this guy sleep in this fcking white house if trump wins you know his house is cooler than the white house he’s like “i’m not sleeping in that shittyass stupid house” trump’s probably got like a tube at home that he opens up and a chinese girl just pops out of it and sucks his dick and goes right back in that’s what i would do if i had that kind of money we’re down to assholes where’s elon musk when you need him where’s the fcking geniuses where’s mark cuban no we got an old lady trying to get back at her husband for a blowjob he got in the ’ we got an old man who hates money and we got a reality tv star with a plastic set of hair you can’t have a president with environmental concerns when every time this motherfcker does his hair we lose a foot of ozone layer and a polar bear bursts into flames he’s got like a closet full of aqua net at home you can’t pretend you don’t give a fck when you have that thing going on dude stop that the white house got broken into while obama was in office the first time in over  years that someone broke into the white house also the first time a girl was guarding the front door by herself “what are you trying to say that women can’t do everything men can do” exactly that’s exactly what i’m saying that seems sexist right people say “you’re sexist” no it’s not sexist here’s why it’s not sexist ‘cause men can’t even do everything men can do see there’s no physical equality folks that’s why we have the olympics ‘cause there’s people that can do some shit that you and i can’t do one of those things is guarding the fcking white house i know i can’t guard the white house you know how i know because i’ve met shaquille o’neal and his dick is where my face is that’s not equality that’s not white privilege listen if the white house is experiencing a shaq attack i’m the wrong dude to save the world i did fear factor with shaq if we’re holding hands it’d be like a sixyearold at the park with his dad we’re barely the same thing so do i think women should guard the white house no i don’t think i should either it’s not sexist to say that women can’t do big physical labor things as good as giant men can but people will tell you it is well i’m not sexist as a matter of fact my favorite people are all female i have a wife and i have three daughters they’re my favorite people in the world but i could beat the fck out of all of them okay listen… if they’re guarding the door i’m getting in i don’t mean to sound cocky but i’m just real confident i could fck them up if i had the flu okay yeah we’re different we’re different i could beat up my cat too i’m not proud of it i just tell you what’s up if you wanna bet money bet money on me i’ll fck that cat up most likely cats are fcking weird like that man i was petting my cat once and he bit me i was like “whoa are we gonna do this what the fck are you doing here” i got a little nervous got a little nervous “women can do everything men can do this guy’s a piece of shit we’re leaving too much information is going in that i don’t agree with” “what the guy said was total bullshit total bullshit” how’d that girl get that job i’ll tell you how that girl got that job because someone let her have that job which means either there were a bunch of guys that were trying to fck her… or her boss was a chick and she hated her either one’s possible look if there was a bunch of guys that were trying to fck her that makes total sense if there’s one hot girl and she’s working with five guys in an office no work’s getting done in that office that office is now just an audition to see which guy gets to fck her each one of those guys will just slowly start to morph to figure out what this girl likes men become like an octopus that tries to fit its way through a keyhole “there’s gotta be a fcking way there’s gotta be a fcking way” you got this girl who’s like “i could guard the front door” “oh you could definitely guard the door no doubt no doubt” and over time if this woman doesn’t sleep with one of these men and claim him over time these guys will just start morphing and they’ll just start saying ridiculous preposterous shit “debbie wants to guard the front door do you have a problem with that” “no i don’t as a matter of fact i think women are amazing plus i’m vegan” and they will just… they will wear patchouli they will do what the fck they have to do next thing you know poor fcking debbie at the front door… “why am i alone”  the whole story is so bananas and it’s one of my favorite stories so i’m gonna give you the whole story of the breakin at the white house with no edits and no comic exaggerations this is the real story ‘cause a lot of people think there’s some grand conspiracy there’s some cabal of evil geniuses that’s pulling the strings on everyone in america it’s most likely that people are just dumb as fck in all sorts of walks of life this is the story this is the real story about the person who broke into the white house first of all people are always worried “the government’s checking out my emails bro the government’s watching us all the time” they pulled this guy over two months before he broke into the white house he had four handguns two rifles and a machete with him they didn’t even watch him he had a map on the map was washington and it had an “x” where the white house is they’re like “you’re good to go” they let him go two months later this motherfcker broke into the white house and why did he break into the white house why do you break into the white house ever because you want to die you don’t… that’s like a suicide run that’s the only reason why someone runs toward the white house if you had to ask someone “what kind of security do you think they have at the white house” “oh dude… they got snipers on every corner they got lasers in the grass if you get too far they open up a door you drop right into jail” nope turns out they don’t even have a dog you just fcking run the guy who made it into the white house he had  rounds of ammunition in his car left that there took a knife that’s a guy who wants to die he’s just sitting in his fcking car going “fck the government fck my exwife and fck everybody i’m gonna do this fck you” just sprinting “oh my god i’m doing it oh my god i’m doing it” thinking with every step “this is gonna be the last step of my life no this is gonna be the last step of my life no this…” and he gets to the front door it’s unlocked he opens it there’s a girl there by herself smacks her to the ground and just starts running through the hall ah he’s probably going “why am i alive” he’s probably thinking… he was inside for minutes for minutes running around he got tackled by an offduty officer he was probably thinking “i wanted to die i don’t want to go to fcking jail will somebody please shoot me” then he was probably pissed “where are my tax dollars going what kind of security are you fcking people running in this place” \n",
            "imagine when obama found out a girl was guarding him he was probably like “everybody everybody not that much diversity i mean what are you playing fcking fairy tale games here” obama’s got a hard job ’cause he’s the first president that’s ever been around while google was here you know he could google his own name if he gets crazy in the middle of the night right “so let me see what the people have to say” he’d just go “obama is a…”  “i’m none of those fcking things” freakin’ out shit  probably thinking “why the fck did i do this” i think the guy who broke into the white house and obama probably have a lot in common in that… they went for it but they probably never really thought they were getting in there you can’t quit once you’re the president the moment obama actually got into office like “good morning mr president” he was probably like “oh no what the fck did i do this for i didn’t think i was actually gonna get in  i can’t sleep i’m freaking out everybody wants to kill me  who the fck is guarding me” looks out in the hallway there’s a girl taking selfies that’d be the greatest selfie of all time a girl with her ass out duck lips in the background a dude’s breaking into the white house  you know i’m not making this up you’ve all seen this this is recognizable pigeontoed is a good move ’cause you can’t get away that good you just like… like there’s something wrong with your back that’s a recognizable pose when did that start ‘cause if you look at the original pictures back when people first invented pictures everybody just stood there looking hungry like if you saw a photo from the  and in the background a girl was going… she’s a fcking time traveler nobody knew that move back then somebody had to see their face “oh people like that they like what i’m doing” combo a twohole combo attractor it’s all over online it gets you a lot of likes i saw a gal on instagram she has eight million followers all she does is take pictures of her ass that’s it she’s got a winning formula she sticks with it no witty memes there’s no inspirational quotes mnhmnh mnhmnh just a lot of this different ways and she’s just a regular girl man i’m watching this i’m like “this is a different kind of person” she has eight million people that have no idea what her voice sounds like she doesn’t have a job that they like she doesn’t have an occupation that they follow they’re just staring at her ass this is a new kind of human there’s never been a person psychologically that’s had to navigate those kind of waters if you really stop and think about it science should really step in and start looking at this don’t go to south america to study some new frog that nobody gives a fck about there’s a girl in florida with eight million people staring at her ass how does this girl keep a relationship what is her day like how many dick pics does she get sent how many dick pics does that girl receive on a daily basis is it like the national debt counter was just fcking spinning out of control constantly i bet if she turns on the notifications her phone just starts screaming and runs away from her i bet if she deletes all the dick pics from her phone it would be physically lighter this is a new kind of person we really have to understand there’s never been a person like this before and she’s just a person like that kind of influence that kind of attractant that’s a very strong drug to have in the hands of just a girl and as a guy who has daughters i just think of that like that’s kind of fcking… that’s weird because this girl has eight million people staring at her ass eight million creeps and weirdos and perverts objectifying her i mean i follow her but i’m not like those other assholes i’m different i care i care about who she is i’m a nice person i’m a hero or something  “i’m different those other guys are assholes men are noble men are noble and true” mmm if we get to come if men don’t get to come we get real sméagollike real quick just a few months of no dates  “mesus is just so disappointed with all the mens mesus meets mesus is so embarrassed at how other mens talks to you mmm oh” everyone wants to set themselves up as being the noble one everybody wants to be matthew mcconaughey to save the world on a rocket ship there’s people that are signing up to go to mars do you know about this there’s a mission to mars a manned mission to mars where  people have signed up to be amongst the four people to die on mars they’re gonna take a oneway trip to mars that’s some sad shit for a bunch of reasons first of all it’s some sad shit ’cause that’s  people that don’t have any real friends right if it’s someone you love your real friend… if one of my friends is gonna move to florida i’ll be like “btch where the fck are you going you’re gonna go to florida we can’t hang out if you go to florida why the fck are you moving to florida man” but you might be able to deal with it “we can just visit each other every now and then” but if your friend was gonna move to mars you’d be like “oh really get in the fcking car just get in the car dude” take him out to death valley “look around sucks right mars sucks worse get back in the car stupid” jesus christ there’s places in america you can’t live man you don’t wanna live in detroit why the fck are you talking about moving to mars people really consider moving to mars it’s one of the dumbest ideas ever but if you say that people will ecobro you have you ever been ecobroed these people will find an opportunity to virtue signal over you as michael shermer likes to point out like puff their chest out and say that they’re probably better than you “hey dude seriously you think there’s something wrong with going to mars well i don’t know if you’ve paid attention man we maybe should colonize mars ’cause california’s almost out of water” then he’ll nod like “yeah btch” we’re right next to the ocean what the fck are you talking about look at all that water you fly over it it takes a day the world’s blue it’s more water than it is not water we have a salt problem we don’t have a water problem suck the salt out of the water we got a goddamn party instead of pissing and moaning… “too complicated bro we gotta go to neptune” oh my god you’re fcking crazy we’re a crazy race filled with crazy people we’re like a dude with a dirty house like “man i gotta build a new house” no you gotta stop shitting in your kitchen stop piling up newspapers you’re never gonna read in front of your bathroom you fck we’re crazy oneway trip to mars a oneway trip in coach with three other people so fcking stupid they’re willing to die on mars with you great what great conversation you’re gonna have it’s nonsense folks my friend was like “they’re not gonna die on mars man if people are smart enough to figure out how to get to mars they’re smart enough to figure out how to get back” here’s why that doesn’t make any sense people smart enough to get to mars aren’t going see that’s the dirty secret about rocket travel ladies and gentlemen nobody smart enough to make a rocket ever gets in one of those fcking things no no they look at each other right before the launch and they go… they talk german and they get behind giant fcking concrete bunkers they take some squarejawed cornfed dude from the middle of the country tuck a bible under that dude’s arm and strap him into that giant metal dick and shoot it off into the heavens that’s what we do and that is what that is that is a metal dick it’s a robot dick and we’re trying to fck the sky we are literally trying to come people out of the tip of a metal dick onto other planets our ultimate goal is that we get those planets pregnant and they’re too filled up with people and then they gotta make a new metal dick “bro we gotta go to jupiter” then they make another one they shoot that fcking thing and they fill jupiter up we just keep filling the cosmos up with people and we never evolve and we never change we stay perfect like we are right now who’s in you’re gonna all come with me we’re gonna leave here right now and go to the church of scientology right down the street and it’s all gonna make sense when you find out that you are an eternal being that created reality so that you can enjoy it i watched that hbo documentary a couple too many times i went clear i think i think i’m clear i’m back i’m back now if you haven’t seen…  i had to watch going clear a scientology documentary ’cause i have a neighbor who’s a scientologist and i don’t even think he’s gay i don’t know what the fck’s going on  but he sleeps really close to me you know like my bed’s here this fcking dude’s bed’s like over there his house is… i mean if you take away the walls he’s fcking right there it’s like “what does this crazy fck believe” and scientology is a wonderful religion not just because it was written by a science fiction author who wrote more fake shit than anyone that’s ever walked the face of the earth and not by a small amount this dude never made a second draft in his fcking life everything was one draft of nonsense and he wrote more of it than anybody not in his neighborhood not in his state not in a year not in a decade more than anyone that’s ever lived ever and scientology is still like “i don’t see any red flags i think we’re good i think this is legit as fck” if scientology is a good religion it’s because other religions get to make fun of ’em it’s like it’s the one religion that even the mormons are like “btch you believe what hold on i mean at least we don’t have video of joseph smith there’s some fcking shitty black and white footage of l ron hubbard with a captain’s outfit on you wanna explain that  why does he have all those awards on why is tom cruise wearing a gold medal the size of a dinner plate what the fck is going on with you people” i watched it with my mom and it was like… first of all scientology they don’t pay taxes that’s disturbing they’re taxfree which means they’re a recognized religion by the government of the united states which means the government of the united states had to go over what they believe and went “everything seems in order none of this shit seems like a cult” well what the fck is a cult and what’s a religion so i had to look it up turns out… i don’t know who wrote this but it’s a perfect definition a cult is bullshit it’s created by one person that person knows it’s bullshit in a religion that dude’s dead so it’s a religion ’cause l ron hubbard’s dead so i guess they got it on a loophole i watched it with my mom and my mom was like “i can’t believe anybody would fall for that” “you made me go to catholic school the fck are you talking about there was a child molester dressed like a sorcerer sitting on a golden throne and you made me call him father slow your roll lady” imagine if i talked to my mom like that oh my god jokes folks just jokes i don’t have a problem with people being religious because i just think life itself is too openended it’s too confusing and i think we’re evolving and part of our struggle in evolving is unanswered questions we wanna seek these answers but in the meanwhile they just give you so much anxiety and it fcks with you so much there’s nothing wrong with joining a cult i think you gotta just join a nice friendly one like the mormons are a good cult here’s why they don’t get mad at anybody like they never kill anybody like here’s a perfect example matt stone and trey parker the guys who created south park they made a hilarious musical called the book of mormon it’s fantastic if you haven’t seen it it’s so fcking hilarious but it’s also brutal brutal about the mormons you know what the mormons did they went to see it and they took out a fullpage ad in the playbill it said “if you enjoyed this musical and you wanna find out more about being a mormon please visit our website” they just took it right on the chin like champs they didn’t get mad they didn’t get defensive they didn’t kill anybody that’s a good cult they just said “what do you wanna do” “we got nine wives shut the fck up” “everybody just… everybody just chill just chill” that’s a good religion that’s a good cult some cults aren’t that good they get fcking testy you know the one we don’t have to say who you know what i’m talking about there’s that one that will kill you if you draw their guy “come on man i can’t even draw your dude what if i draw a dude drawing your dude” “no loopholes” “fckin’ relax bro” and this isn’t just theoretical people have died ’cause they made cartoons before the most recent paris attacks there was a magazine called charlie hebdo and they were attacked where  cartoonists were killed eleven more were wounded and they killed a cop too fcking crazy over cartoons and when you… when there’s radical crazy people in the world what’s interesting is the reaction to radical crazy people and how everything just sort of kind of balances itself out when things get weird because when these people got killed over a cartoon the whole world was in shock the whole world was outraged but one of the scariest things about it was nobody wanted to print those pictures you couldn’t see ’em in the la times you couldn’t find them in time magazine you had to go online and find them it was a dark moment for free speech because everybody’s like “oh i don’t wanna get killed i don’t wanna show the pictures” it was weird until… the balance because after they got killed and nobody wanted to print the pictures word got back to texas… where they promptly held a “draw muhammad” contest in garland texas i’m not making a word of this up you can google it and i’ll wait they had a “draw muhammad” contest in garland texas two dudes showed up started shooting at the building they were killed almost instantly why because they were at a “draw muhammad” contest in texas how obvious does a trap have to be before you start getting suspicious what are you livin’ in a wile e coyote cartoon motherfcker you ever go to texas that’s not santa monica btch that’s a totally different kind of white people those are some wild west people that have computers and modern guns they’re not supposed to be there people didn’t evolve in texas it’s not like they were monkeys then they became people and they stayed in that spot no no they landed on boats on the east coast the stubborn ones stayed the smart ones made it to california but along the way we lost a bunch of people  and some of them just stuck around “y’all go ahead we’re gonna hang back here i’m gonna draw the biggest dick the world’s ever seen in the sand my wife’s got the biggest titties i’mma try to fck a snake i think it can be done” they just stayed they just gathered cattle stockpiled ammo and they all talk alike and that’s why you gotta be nervous you gotta be nervous in places with accents okay it’s one of the reasons why i can prove that california is the best spot to live ‘cause all the spots that suck they all have to sound like each other ‘cause i grew up in a place like that i grew up in boston it’s not that the people in boston suck but the weather sucks it’s fcking horrible and in the winter everybody gets in their car in the morning and just goes “fck fck fck fck fck fck fck fck fck fck” and everybody’s worried about… it’s a real possibility you might starve to death one day you might freeze trying to walk home  so they all talk in the same way “oh my god how many more months till summer ahhh when is this fcking winter gonna be over we need more firewood”  they have to sound like the people around them so if other people invade like “we stick together we’re all in this together” that’s how they are in texas too they’re like “y’all ain’t from around here are ya” they have a fcking certain way of talking which is proof positive why california is the best spot try making fun of a california accent what are you gonna do speak clear and concise what are you gonna do you gonna mock us you’re gonna say some shit that everybody understands they’re not supposed to be in texas folks it’s not even a state it’s a republic they were like “man we ain’t so sure about this whole united states thing we’re gonna hang back hang back see how this plays out” they don’t have any rules they have like three pages of rule books here’s how i know this i’m gonna tell you a fact a fact about texas that will change the way you think about texas there are more tigers in captivity in texas in private collections than there are in all of the wild of the world i’m gonna repeat it because i know you’re like “oh the fear factor guy is just making shit up to make his jokes work” no there’s more tigers in dudes’ yards in texas than the rest of the fcking planet how is that possible because they can because they went through the rule book…  “it don’t say shit about tigers order it up dude order it up dude” one guy got a tiger and his neighbor’s like “shit i didn’t know we could get tigers” and he got two tigers and the first guy was like “i ain’t about to let this faggot outtiger me” and he opened up tiger world with his oil money we’re gonna need those people folks if the russians invade we can’t make fcking warrior babies with those chicks in marin county with fake asses and rubber lips okay we’re gonna need some real warrior genes we’re gonna need some women who wear nonironic daisy dukes they got cowboy boots with no socks and stinky feet and they yell out “chris kyle rest in peace” when you make ’em come we need those women if the russians come we gotta be ready think about the children think about the children while i get a sip this is super important ladies and gentlemen a lot of people are sleeping on…  imagine if i had real points oh jesus christ  i love you fckers too man so excited to be here  i have kids and i lie to them i get high around ’em too people say you shouldn’t do that but they don’t see it they say you shouldn’t be intoxicated around your children well i’m not i’m high i call it “elevated” it’s a different thing the people who have a problem with that they don’t understand what getting high is like they think you’re gonna be to your kid like “who are you” what do you think what’s the worst thing that can happen if i’m a little high around my kid they’re gonna get extra hugs and daddy’s going to be paranoid about objects “look out don’t go there” that’s it plus i have cool conversations i have a sixyearold daughter man there’s not a lot of  man and  girl have in common other than the fact she’s my daughter and so our conversations are normally pretty boring but when i’m high i’m like “you know you call that thing your baby your doll you call it your baby but you know it’s not a baby right” “yeah i know it’s not a baby” “do you call it a baby because you’re the youngest and you like having someone who is responsible for you” “maybe” “okay that’s cool that’s cool give me a hug i love you”  it’s weird man it’s weird raising little people there’s some things that i didn’t expect one of the things i didn’t expect is you have to lie to them like you don’t have to lie to them about a lot of things but you have to lie to them about santa claus it’s just one of those things man ’cause it’s like a community you have to think about what your kid’s gonna tell other kids because when it comes to santa claus you don’t want your kid to be one of two things you don’t want your kid to be the first kid that tells everyone that santa claus is bullshit ’cause that kid’s an asshole but you don’t want your kid to be the last kid that figures out that santa claus is bullshit ’cause that kid’s a moron so you got… you got a little bit of… you’re like “oh no when do we do this when do we do this” and no one knows when to do it you just let the kids figure it out then they’re like “dad what the fck” you’re like “aw… oh i missed the boat i missed the boat” nobody knows when to do it nobody can be honest about it they have little meetings and shit and i’m like “when do we tell ’em” this lady goes “when they’re ” they’re gonna be fcking by then i told her it was funny she didn’t believe me i’m like “oh i’m sorry i’m off by a year” that’s not as funny but it’s… i didn’t mean it but it’s this thing they want to keep the kids in the dark and they wanna pretend they’re the only one that’s teaching the kid this is a weird thing that people do they’re like “i teach my kids man i teach my kids” “eh… when you see ’em” but unless you’re some freak who homeschools your children in the forest your kid’s gonna go to school they’re gonna go to school and they’re gonna be in a class with  other kids the teacher only makes  bucks a year and she’s thinking about dick that’s all she’s thinking about she’s thinking about getting stuffed she’s a young fertile woman who loves kids and she’s writing on that chalkboard and the kids all huddle up and share information like “yeah what did your dad tell you your dad tell you that yeah my dad says santa claus is fcking bullshit okay you ever go near a chimney it’s that big what the fck teacher’s coming play with blocks act stupid uh how does this work” they play dumb they play dumb they’re like little prisoners trying to figure their way out they make little papiermâché heads and pretend they’re napping they’re little humans they wanna run shit “who is these people telling us what to do are they being straight with us man what the fck is going on” i knew the day my daughter knew that santa claus is bullshit she came home stared me down she was like maddogging me she took her book bag and just goes…  walked right up to the chimney looking at me “how the fck” “dad have you ever met santa claus” “no honey i’ve never met him” “but you let him in the house” and there’s this moment… it was a moment where a sevenyearold has you at checkmate you’re like “oh shit” i don’t know whether to highfive her or to keep lying you wanna go “yeah you got me you got me you got me that’s bullshit no the big bang is real but this is bullshit” the big bang sounds even less real the problem is you have to be consistent if you’re teaching your kids nonsense you gotta teach ’em only nonsense you can’t mix nonsense in with like real stuff like my daughter will go like “how do birds fly” i go “birds have bones that are hollow so they’re really light then they have feathers which cover a large surface area and they use the hollow bones and the feathers to push down on the air see the air looks like it’s nothing right but it’s actually a bunch of gases that’s why the trees move when the wind blows the birds can manipulate that and go through  space” “whoa” “yeah nature is crazy” “yeah how does the fat man get through the little hole” “magic christmas magic now go to bed i’m trying to fck your mom go to bed”  jokes folks just jokes can’t talk like that that’s how you make strippers you gotta be nice they’re little tiny people they’re adorable they don’t know anything yet you gotta teach ’em everything you can’t talk mean  kids are a lot like really fcking stupid people… in that if you get ten really stupid people in a room the most confident one just starts running shit they don’t have to have any more information they just have to be more confident if you get a bunch of dummies together they’re like “i don’t know what’s going on” “i don’t know what’s going on” “i fcking do i fcking do” the guy doesn’t have to have any extra data he just has to be the only one that’s confident and that’s what it’s like in school my daughter’s class has this fcking kid named debbie and every day it’s “debbie says…” oh fcking debbie says debbie says what you don’t think about that before you have kids not only are you gonna have kids but your kids are gonna make friends and then you have to make friends with the fcking parents of your kids and some of ’em are crazy my daughter’s like “debbie says adam and eve are the only two people in the world and all people came from them is that true”  and this is weird like you don’t know what to do right you want to be diplomatic you don’t want to cause problems at school but you gotta be honest and one of the most difficult things to say to a kid is “i don’t know” i’m like “sweetie i don’t know i don’t know if adam and eve is where people came from but nobody knows because no one from today is alive back then so it’s not something you can measure so it’s not something you can see so we don’t know but here’s what we do know you know how some people have big ears and some people have little ears” “yeah” “well some people have brains that are made out of dog shit and they get horny too and what happens is they have to find someone even dumber than them to have sex with it’s like the opposite of evolution and then they have a kid and their kid is fcked their kid is fcked and everybody wants to pretend it’s a level playing field there’s no level anywhere you look is an eagle and a salmon level does the salmon ever get to eat the eagle no the universe does not want even it wants conflict and resolution and constant improvement okay i’m gonna shut this light out and i’m gonna go fck your mom right in the mouth all right” i don’t say these things i don’t say any of these things i was like “i don’t know maybe debbie’s right doesn’t make sense to me how would that work” “how would that work” “it wouldn’t work would it” adam and eve are the only two people they have kids and then where do all the other people come from i guess the kids just start fcking each other is that what happens mom fcks the kids or the… yeah exactly debbie’s parents they were at my house man for a cookout and the dude told me the earth’s  years old they’re young earth christians they’re sweet people by the way before i shit on them… i’m gonna shit on them but before i shit on them they’re sweet they’re really nice people i hug ’em every time i see ’em they’re really kind nice people but they just found a part of their brain they’re like “i have no use for this”  chucked that whole logic discerningreason part “this fcking thing’s confusing” they’re young earth christians which means they follow the strictest interpretation of the bible possible i’m like “how many people believe the earth is less than  years old” uh i looked it up there’s a recent gallup poll that said that  of america believes the earth is less than  years old  here’s why you shouldn’t be scared they can only measure people dumb enough to answer polls and when you factor that in you’re talking about a really small number ‘cause you know what the average response is if you call people up and say “how old’s the earth” number one answer is “older than your mother’s pussy” and then they hang up number two answer is “fck you” after that you start throwing numbers around and only  of those dummies were stupid enough to think the earth is  years old that’s debbie’s fcking parents so out of the people that answer polls… is it even  it might be  only  are that fcking stupid and that’s the  we should really be worried about we’re worried about the wrong  not that we shouldn’t be worried about the really rich greedy people we definitely should we should definitely worry about bankers and people who… they’re just stockpiling resources they could help the world in some really impossible ways for anybody else but they don’t they’d rather just pile up their gold  yeah that  is awful but there’s another  that freaks me the fck out that no one’s talking about that’s the  who leave comments on youtube videos who the fck are those freaks could you imagine people talking to each other like that in real life and not beating the shit out of each other i mean if jesus christ himself came back from the dead and had a youtube page the first comment would be “you ain’t shit without your dad pussy” these are monsters this is not a normal person’s response normal people don’t leave comments what a normal person does they watch a video they like it or they don’t like it that’s it it ends right there but what you’re dealing with is the process of racism and child abuse and neglect and shitty genes and the insane clown posse is playing they know all the words and they’re wafting up their farts and their cheez doodle fingers and like “an open letter to jennifer lopez… let me pause and just jerk off in my shirt real quick here  ugh… dear jennifer don’t you think it’s about time you dress a little more classy what are your children gonna see when they see…” just fcking think of the meanest most biting shit that’s gonna cut it as if jennifer lopez has time in between eating diamonds and fcking all her background dancers in a castle that she built with her ass but you know “let me check the youtube comments to see if my selfesteem’s on point oh” and you know who’s dumber than them me ‘cause i read their shit and i get mad i know they’re stupid i still get upset fck this is the world folks this is the world we’re living in are we happy i’m not sure is this what we wanted i don’t know  no no  no are you sure  no why are you doing this what is this what are you doing are you fighting for freedom what’s happening  no are you white panthers what is this  life sucks what are you saying  life can kind of suck sometimes life can kind of suck maybe it’s how you’re livin’ it btch “life can kind of suck” it’s the greatest time ever to be alive “yeah i’d live in the old days when you could die from crabs” it doesn’t get any better than today man so stupid “make america great again” it’s as good as it’s ever been what the fck are you saying we have  everywhere when has it been better we have netflix when has it been better come on man stop it’s never been better this is as good as it’s ever been it’s just weird it’s just weird you gotta get your shit together btch don’t blame the world god damn it damn it man and listen if you’ve seen any of this show and you said “i think some of the stuff you’re saying is really funny but i sense a lot of like macho posturing from you i sense a lot of like bullshit toughguy stuff” you’re totally correct and what it is is i live with all women okay and i’m becoming more of a btch every day of my life and i just wanna say i’m not unhappy i’ve never been more happy in my life this is the happiest i’ve ever been but when you’re with all girls like you have all girls all the time you have to make little compromises you don’t think about it while it’s happening it’s like the rock doesn’t think about the water carving a path through it but eventually that fcking path is gonna get deep and when you’re with all people that are different than you they just go “hmm…” they just start looking at you like little raptors testing the fence  they’ll just start poking at you it’s what people do it’s natural it’s just what people do if you live with people that all are on att and you’re on verizon they’re like “dude look at my bars make the switch come on over what are you a fcking democrat dude libertarian is where it’s at wake up join us” when you’re with all girls they just start… they constantly fck with my manhood it’s like i’ll come home and some new thing is painted pink i’m like “why is this pink” “it looks better pink daddy” “it looks better pink daddy” and my wife’s like “i think they’re right” i’m like “oh… i see what the fck is going on here it’s mutiny” they just chip chip chip away it’s like if my manhood was a mountain of marbles every day they steal two they just walk up to my stack… you can’t say shit you can’t say shit ’cause it’s only two marbles and you’re like “i still got all these marbles everything is gonna be okay i’ll deal with this eventually” but you’re not gonna deal with it every day two more marbles you never get those marbles back you see it comin’ you don’t do anything about it you’re like “i gotta go to sleep all right everybody stop crying i gotta go to sleep” and men don’t want to admit that “not me bro not me bro i’d rather just live in the woods by myself” what are you a fcking coldplay song huh what are you a character in a book you piece of shit no one’s honest no one’s honest about how much we need other people that’s why the characters that we adore so much in the movies are the people that don’t need people the people who just walk away from it all like “wow what a rebel” but in real life we need people so bad that the worst shit you can do to a prisoner is put them in solitary confinement so think about that you’re in a cement box filled with rapists and murderers and the worst shit they can do is leave you alone we’re fcking weird we are weird ’cause what we are really is we’re some weird superorganism that like needs each other in some sort of strange way but we’re all in denial “i’m kind of a loner” oh shut the fck up there’s no such thing it’s not real every person in this room me included all of us we are all a calculation we’re all an ongoing onrunning calculation of all the interactions you’ve ever had with all the people that you’ve ever met and you do a bunch of things that people like and start doing more of that you’re like “i’ll do more of that” you find things that people don’t like you’re like “i’ll keep that shit to myself hmm i don’t like that feeling hmm” that’s what we do that’s what we do it’s weird we don’t want to admit it but that’s who we all are and i’m just telling you this because i’ve never been more of a btch right now i have slowly but surely bent until i’m in this position this is how i’m riding out my days just like this “okay okay okay okay” but i’m also telling you right now that i’m not going out like bruce jenner oh that’s right politically correct san francisco here’s my take on this bruce jenner thing and you know everybody has their own… not really this is what everybody’s take is this is the take that you’re supposed to have “he’s always been a woman trapped in a man’s body” maybe definitely maybe definitely people are like that definitely there are people who were born in the wrong gender and am i saying they should stay their gender no who gives a fck you should do whatever you wanna do you should be happy you should be free i don’t care what you do but… it’s also possible that maybe if you live with crazy btches long enough you become one that’s all i’m saying i don’t see this discussed it is entirely possible if you put a praying mantis on a leaf it becomes the color of the leaf why because it wants to live it wants to survive it wants to be accepted by its environment you show me a man who’s lived with the kardashians for ten years who didn’t come out a chick and then we’ll have some data okay ‘cause right now we lost a fcking american olympian and i want you to have some respect we’re down bruce jenner and i’ve got a close eye on kanye west and i don’t exactly like what i’m seeing  look at kanye west he’s a very talented young heterosexual man who starts a clothing line… he’s clearly jealous about taylor swift and he tweets like a cokedup stripper in the middle of the night you don’t see what i’m seeing we are watching the plot of a fcking stephen king book play out an american athletic hero moves in with a woman who’s made hundreds of millions of dollars through no way anyone can explain to anyone he breaks up with her she turns him into a chick the whole world tells him he’s beautiful you tell me you don’t see what i’m seeing you have to say… you have to say she’s beautiful “she’s beautiful” she’s not beautiful and neither am i look i look like a thumb with two thumbs okay you put me in a dress i’d be even more disgusting “beauty’s unusual” there’s a lot of cool shit that isn’t beautiful sixtyyearold dudes in skirts are on that list jesus fcking christ what kind of games are we playing here why are you lying to children that’s beautiful what are my kids gonna think when they see a mountain or a rose “is that beautiful too daddy explain” ahhh bang i can’t the world’s gone fcking bananas “what you’re saying is horribly transphobic and incredibly regressive you should be embarrassed at what you’re doing you’re doing this just to get laughs at someone else’s expense” maybe or maybe bruce jenner lived with demons maybe they waited by the bed… until they knew he was in heavy rem sleep… so they could assume their true form  climb up and kick off their designer shoes to reveal black raven’s claws clutched the edge of the bed and just… whispered in his ear   “bruce…  we would like you better if you were one of us” “ i can’t i can’t be one of you i was… i was born a man” “nonsense   nonsense bruce… you no longer can be held prisoner by the gender of your birth you’re free bruce…  your lips are too thin… for the cover of vanity fair” “huh what wait wait did you say the cover okay are you fcking with me because… you know the cover’s always been my dream” “it can be real  it can be real all dreams… can be real through surgery sleep”  thank you very much san francisco i had a great fcking time with you savages let’s take a selfie shit we got it putting together one of these fcking specials is stressful as shit i appreciate the fck out of all you people being here tonight and i love you guys thank you very much   your email address will not be published required fields are marked  \n",

            "armed with boyish charm and a sharp wit, the former “snl” writer john mulaney offers sly takes on marriage, his beef with babies and the time he met bill clinton all right, petunia. wish me luck out there. you will die on august 7th, 2037. that’s pretty good. all right. hello. hello, chicago. nice to see you again. thank you. that was very nice. thank you. look, now, you’re a wonderful crowd, but i need you to keep your energy up the entire show, okay? because… no, no, no. thank you. some crowds… some crowds, they have big energy in the beginning and then they run out of places to go. so… i don’t judge those crowds, by the way, okay? we’ve all gone too big too fast and then run out of room. we’ve all made a “happy birthday” sign… wait. you get that poster board up, and you’re like, “i don’t need to trace it. i know how big letters should be. to begin with, a big-ass ‘h’. followed by a big-ass ‘a’ and… oh, no! oh, god! okay, all right. real skinny ‘p’ with a high hump, and then we’ll put the second ‘p’ below the hump of that first ‘p’, sort of like a motorcycle sidecar situation. and now i have no room for the ‘y’, so i’ll do a kind of curled-up noodle ‘y’. block letters and cursive look good together.” and then you go to write “birthday” and you totally forget the lesson you just learned with “happy.” you’re like, “yeah, but the past is the past. big-ass ‘b’. surely more letters will fit in the same space.” you’re very friendly here in chicago. i mean, we’re all violent here, but you’re very friendly. no, really. and i don’t like confrontation, ’cause i’ve never been in a fight before. though, maybe you could tell that from the first moment i walked out on stage. i don’t give off that vibe. some people give off a vibe of… right away, they’re like, “do not fuck with me.” my vibe is more like, “hey, you could pour soup in my lap and i’ll probably apologize to you.” when i walk, for real, my feet go out like this. i’m so open and vulnerable. i look like a doll that you point out molestation on. “show us on this white comedian where the man touched you.” it’s been a while since i’ve been home to chicago. i got married since then. thank you. i married my wife. i love saying “my wife.” it sounds so adult. “that’s my wife.” it’s great, you sound like a person. i said it even before we were married. we were just dating, and we were once getting on an airplane, and anna’s ticket didn’t say anything and my ticket said “priority access.” it doesn’t matter why. but we were getting on and i said, “uh, can my wife board with me?” and they were like, “yes, of course. right this way.” and i was like, “oh, that is so much better than all those times i was like, ‘can my girlfriend come?'” and, yeah, i shouldn’t have said it that way, but still. “my wife” just has some kick-ass to it, you know? “get away from my wife! no one talk to my wife!” marriage is gonna be very magical. “i didn’t kill my wife!” that’s like, “ooh, who’s that fella? i bet he did kill his wife.” being married is so nice. i never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself. that’s not really a joke, that’s just a little sweet thing i like to say. ‘cause i’d been in relationships where i got cheated on, like, long ones. i don’t know if you’ve ever been in a long relationship where you got cheated on, but it changes your whole worldview. ‘cause when i was a kid, i used to watch america’s most wanted. you know how kids do. and i would always think to myself, “how could another person kill someone? how could a human being kill another human being?” and then i got cheated on, and i was like, “oh, okay.” “i’m not gonna do it, but i totally get it.” and i don’t mean in that way of, like, “no one else can have you.” i don’t care about that. it’s just creepy to have an ex out there after things have ended badly. they have a lot of information. anyone who’s seen my dick and met my parents needs to die. i can’t have them roaming around. i talked to a lot of people before i got engaged, you know. and i heard this expression about whether or not you should get married. this is an old expression. people say this. they say, “why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” you ever heard that before? it’s a bananas insulting expression… to an entire gender. but also, it makes no sense. “why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” you’re not allowed to milk a cow that you don’t own. that’s not even a situation. was that a problem at one point? like, in the dairy community? was that happening a hundred years ago in some village? some dutch prick was sneaking in at night being like, “ah-ha-ha, i take your milk.” and the farmer was like, “well, then, this is your cow now.” and he was like, “no, no proof of purchase.” and he ran off into the night. that sounded dutch, right? you know what that… you know what that expression means? it means, “why would you marry a woman if she’s already having sex with you?” which has nothing to do with what relationships are even like anymore. now, it’s like, “why buy the cow?” uh, maybe because, every day, the cow asks you when you’re gonna buy it. and… … you live in a really small apartment with the cow, so you can’t avoid that question at all. and also, the cow is way better at arguing than you are. and the cow grew up in a family that knows how to argue. “why buy the cow?” uh, maybe because every time another cow gets bought, you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale, and your cow looks over at you the entire time like… and does not enjoy the sale at all… even though she’s the one that wanted to go to the sale. and she’s especially mad because that farmer and cow met, like, eight months after you guys met. “why buy the cow?” well, let’s be real here. you’re very lucky to have the cow that you do have. “roping in cows and getting milk out of them was never anything you were known for, john.” by the most liberal of estimates, there have been about eight cows total, several unmilked, and… a lot of people think that you like bulls, and if you just bought… they assume it. when you search your name, the third thing to come up is like, “john mulaney bull?” and if you just bought the cow, nobody would say that anymore. they’ll still say it. ‘cause there are those guys who, they buy a cow, and then on the side, total matador, but… but, for real, chicago, why buy the cow? let’s be real. why buy the cow? because you love her. you really do. and, yeah, yeah… sure, she’s a bossy little jew, but… … she takes care of you. and you don’t wanna be some old man stumbling around, like, “hey, you seen any loose milk?” my wife is jewish. she’s a new york jew. i did it! now, i was raised catholic. i don’t know if you can tell that from the everything about me. my wife is jewish, i grew up catholic, so we got married by a friend. being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families’ religions, while confusing the elderly people at the wedding. “what’s the name of the bishop?” “that’s actually stand-up comedian dan levy. he was the host of mtv’s your face or mine?” i saw a lot of catholic weddings, though, because i was an altar boy… and a hush falls over the room. isn’t it weird how that became a scandalous thing? that was just some boring shit i had to do on weekends. but now, it’s like saying, “i was a french maid for a period of time. i was treated well in my day. i worked for a variety of sirs.” no, being an altar boy was just a boring gig, you know? you’d serve mass and then you’d serve weddings sometimes. my brother was once an altar boy at a wedding, and he was standing there with another altar boy in this big, packed church in chicago where we grew up. and the bride was coming down the aisle, and the organ was playing, and all the pews were filled, and the bride got all the way to the altar, and the groom lifted the veil off of the bride, and right at that moment the other altar boy said, “aw, she’s ugly.” and then they looked, and they were right next to the video camera. and i know that’s awful, but wouldn’t you give a million dollars to see that wedding video? it was the best moment of this stupid woman’s life, and she’s walking down the aisle, and the organ’s like… and she gets all the way to the altar to her betrothed, and he unveils her to the world and to the eyes of god. and right at that second, for no reason at all, some cheeto-fingered, rat-mustached, 13-year-old prick decides to go, “aw, she’s ugly!” hopefully the videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it to be like, “aw, she’s beautiful. she’s enchanting.” i grew up catholic. i don’t go to church anymore. but i went on christmas eve with my parents, ’cause you know how you lie to your parents. so… we go into the church and i was like, “i got this under control.” and then i got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit. no, i was going through mass and i was batting, like, .400. and then in the middle of mass, the priest said, “peace be with you.” and everyone said, “and with your spirit.” and i was the one pre-y2k asshole going, “and also with you. what? huh? what? huh? what? when? when?” for those of you that aren’t catholic, i don’t mean to exclude you, even though we love to exclude you, but… there’s a part in church where the priest says, “peace be with you.” and for many, many years, we all said… – “and also with you.” – very good. but they changed it to “and with your spirit.” because that’s what needed revamping in the catholic church. that was the squeaky wheel that needed the grease. in rome, they were like, “let’s see. what problems can we solve? problem one. no.” i’m actually glad they changed that, though. i never liked “and also with you.” i always found that clunky. “and also with you.” that’s not how you talk. – “have a nice day.” – “and also you having one.” it’s just a little bit wrong, isn’t it? it’s just a little off. like, when someone’s like, “how are you?” and you’re like, “nothing much.” and it sort of makes sense. never begin a sentence with “and also.” you just immediately sound caught off-guard. it sounds like if at the first church ever, like, they weren’t expecting it. like, the priest was like, “hey, this is the first time we’ve ever had church. i just wanna say, ‘peace be with you.'” and they were like… “what? oh. uh, yeah. and also you should have some.” “hey, that’s good. let’s keep that for 2,000 years. and then change it to trick john.” my wife and i don’t have any children, we have a dog. we have a little puppy named petunia. she’s a tiny little french bulldog puppy. i like having a puppy that’s a bulldog, ’cause it’s like having a baby that is also a grandma. her body is young, her face is as old as time. she definitely saw the nazis march into paris. she always gives me this look of like, “oh, the things i have seen, you cocksucker. you have no idea. the gestapo threw my printing press into a river. but, go, tell your fucking jokes. bring me my dish.” she said that. petunia… petunia is my best friend in the world. i give her a million kisses a day. she does not like me, and barks at me and bites me all day long. we had to get a dog trainer into the apartment because petunia is a bad dog. we tell her that every day. we go, “hey, you’re bad at being a dog.” so, the trainer came into the apartment. sorry, didn’t even walk into the apartment, walked into the threshold and went, “oh, okay.” like she was an exorcist or something. she said, “i see what the problem is.” she said, “petunia has become the alpha of the house.” and then she pointed at me, she said, “you are no longer the alpha of the house.” and in the back of my head, i was like, “i was never the alpha of the house.” i turned to my wife, i was like, “let’s pretend. it’ll be fun. yes… my title of alpha, which i once had, how can i reclaim it? because that was a thing that existed at one time.” she said, “you need to show dominance over your puppy.” these are things people say to me. i said, “how do i do that?” she said, “well, let me ask you this. who eats dinner first, you or petunia?” i was like, “petunia eats dinner first. she eats dinner at 5:00 p.m., ’cause she’s a foot long and two years old.” she said, “no, you need to eat dinner first. because the king eats before anyone else eats.” oh, yes, and what a mighty king i will be, eating dinner at 4:45 in the afternoon. “look upon your sovereign, petunia, and tremble. my lands stretch across this entire one bedroom, and i eat dinner whenever i choose, as long as it works for the schedule of a dog.” she said, “now, you don’t actually have to eat dinner before petunia. you just have to convince petunia that you’ve already eaten.” so… for the past month, i shit you not… before my wife and i give petunia her dish, we take down empty bowls and spoons, and in front of her, we go, “mmm, dinner. mmm, good dinner.” like we’re space aliens in a play about human beings that they wrote, but they didn’t work that hard on. “mmm, we’re eating dinner.” meanwhile, petunia’s just staring at us with her paul giamatti face, like… “you’re not eating dinner, cocksucker. dish, now.” i have a wife and a dog, and we just bought a house. we have a new house. it was built in the ’20s, but it was flipped in 2014. which means it’s haunted, but it has a lovely kitchen backsplash. actually, we didn’t buy a house. a bank bought a house, and i’m allowed to keep my shirts and pants there while i pay it off for 30 years. the woman from the bank came over and she showed me my mortgage broken down month by month for 30 years. and she said, “so, for instance, this is what you’ll pay in july of 2029.” and i burst out laughing. i was like, “2029? that’s not a real year. by 2029, i’ll be drinking moon juice with president jonathan taylor thomas. i’m not gonna be writing you a paper check.” i like having a house, but i loved looking for a house, ’cause i love real estate agents. i mean, they are the true heroes. they really are. have you ever watched hgtv? real estate agents have to deal with the dumbest people in the world making the biggest decisions of their lives. every episode of hgtv is like, “craig and stacia are looking for a two-story a-frame that’s near craig’s job in the downtown, but also satisfies stacia’s need to be near the beach which is nowhere near craig’s job. with three children and nine on the way, and a max budget of $7… let’s see what lori jo can do on this week’s episode of you don’t deserve a beach house.” i loved our real estate agent. it was so fun to hang out with her. it was like hanging out with my mom. ‘cause, you know, real estate agents always look like your mom. and they have various chico’s accoutrements. they always have kind of fun mom energy. and they’re always, “so excited to see you two.” we would have little conferences before we walked into a house. she’d go, “let’s talk. let’s talk before we go in.” we’re, like, two feet from the door. “so, there’s no toilets. and i know that was on your list. but i think i can get him to budge. let’s go.” so, we’d have a real estate agent, and then, like, the house would have a real estate agent who’s just some guy sitting in a big chair. and these two always hated each other. they’d be like, “hi, tony.” “hi, kim.” it’s like, “jesus christ! what, were you two in the eagles together? what is the animosity about?” our real estate agent wanted us to have a baby more than anyone else in our lives, more than anyone in our family. she hinted about it constantly. every room she walked into, she’d be like, “so, this could be an office.” “or maybe a nursery.” “yeah. no, like we said, we don’t know if we’re gonna have… ” “no, no. i know, i know, you know. you don’t know if you’re gonna have ’em, but you know. you know, you never know. sometimes you don’t know what’s gonna happen, and then… you know, something happens.” “well, yeah, that’s how all of life works.” “okay, all right. okay. uh-huh. mmm. this is an on-fire garbage can. could be a nursery.” she showed me a backyard once. she goes, “i don’t even like this backyard for you.” i was like, “oh, do tell.” she said, “it’s all pavement. i think you should have some grass out there. you know, in case you have a couple… little guys… running around in the grass.” and i got offended on behalf of my imaginary kids. i was like, “hey, lady. i went outside about as much as powder from the movie powder. my children are not gonna be playing out on grass. they will be up in their rooms playing violent video games and catfishing pedophiles. these are my children. and that’s my wife!” i didn’t mean to make it sound like we don’t want children. we don’t, but i didn’t mean to make it sound like that. see, i just don’t think babies like me very much. sometimes babies will point at me, and i don’t care for that shit at all. like, i’ll be on an elevator, and a baby will be there in its big, like, stroller activity tray, just, like, working on one cheerio with bobby fischer-like intensity. and it’ll look up at me and go… i like to lean in and go, “stop snitchin’, motherfucker.” and then walk off. ‘cause you’re never too young to learn our national no-snitching policy. my friends have babies and i don’t do so well with them. i had a run-in with a two-year-old girl. i know there are better ways to start that story, but… my friend, jeremy, has this two-year-old girl, and i really like her. she’s a sweet kid. i really like his daughter a lot. but i was over at his family’s house for the fourth of july, and he had his daughter on his knee. and it was a very lovely day. his whole extended family was there. and he was bouncing his two-year-old up and down, and he pointed at me and he said to his two-year-old, “do you know who that is? that’s your uncle john.” and i was like, “oh, my god. that’s so sweet. i’m her uncle john.” and then the baby pointed at me and said, “uncle john has a penis.” i thank you for laughing, because no one did that day! fell deadly silent, is what they all did. hey, do you know what you’re supposed to say when a baby points at you and knowingly says, “he has a penis”? no, i’m asking, ’cause i don’t know what to say in that situation. here’s what i went with that day. i said, “oh, come on!” i don’t know. i thought that’d be good. but then it just made it worse, ’cause it sounded like the baby and i had an arrangement not to talk about it, and she had violated my trust. like, the baby had been like, “do you have a penis?” and i was like, “yes, i do, but you’re a baby, so discretion is key.” and then the next day she goes, “he has a penis,” and i go, “oh, come on! someone can’t keep a secret!” luckily, jeremy’s wife saved the day. the baby’s mom saved the day. she came in and she picked up the baby, and she was like, “it’s okay. she’s just going through that phase where she says penis and vagina a lot.” aren’t we all? and, by the way, it would’ve been a totally different situation if the baby had said vagina. like, if a grown woman had walked in the room, and the baby had been like, “she has a vagina,” the woman could be like, “yes, i do, and it’s magnificent.” and we would all be like, “hooray! you are brave!” no one wants to applaud the penis of a 32-year-old weirdo. it’s fun to be married. i’ve never been supervised before. i’m supervised. she studies what i do. like an anthropologist. she’ll be like, “sometimes, he will watch a movie on tv even though he already owns that movie on dvd. pointing this out to him confuses and upsets him.” i had no supervision when i was a kid. we were free to do what we wanted. but also, with that, no one cared about kids. i grew up before children were special. i did. very early ’80s, right before children became special. like, i remember when milk carton kids became a thing. when they were like, “hey, we should start looking for some of these guys. i don’t think they’re just blowing off steam.” no one cared about my opinion when i was a little kid. no one cared what i thought. sometimes, people would say, “what do you think you’re doing?” but that just meant “stop.” they didn’t actually wanna know my thought process. they didn’t want me to be like, “well, i was gonna put this bottle rocket into this carton of eggs, so that when i lit off the bottle rocket, the eggs would explode everywhere.” “oh, well, that’s very interesting. and what brought you to this experiment?” “oh, well, thank you for asking. well… you know how i’m filled with rage? i’m so horny and angry all the time… and i have no outlet for it. so… eggs.” your opinion doesn’t matter in elementary school either. it matters in college. college is just your opinion. just you raising your hand and being like, “i think emily dickinson’s a lesbian.” and they’re like, “partial credit.” and that’s a whole thing. but in elementary school, it doesn’t matter what you think, it just matters what you know. you have to have answers to questions. and if you say, “i don’t know,” you get an x on your test, and you get it wrong and that’s not fair, ’cause your brain has never been smaller. also, that’s not how life works. i’m in my 30s now. if you came to me now and you were like, “hey, john, name three things that the stamp act of 1775 accomplished.” i’d go, “i don’t know. get out of my apartment,” you know? but when you’re a little kid, you can’t say, “i don’t know.” you should be able to. that should be an acceptable answer on a test. you should be able to write in, “i don’t know. i know you told me. but i have had a very long day. i am very small. and i have no money. so you can imagine the kind of stress that i am under.” or if it’s one of those true or false questions, you should be able to add a third option which is, “who’s to say?” kids are much more supervised now, but also, they have a lot of rights. like, that’s the biggest civil rights increase i’ve seen in my lifetime. the rights of children have gone through the roof. i had no rights when i was a little kid. i remember, one time, i walked into a supermarket by myself, and i walked in through the double doors, and the woman behind the register just looked at me and she went, “no!” and i went, “all right.” and i turned around and left. that’s how broken i was. and there weren’t special things for kids the way there are now. like, we would just go see movies. any movie. like back to the future. that was a movie everyone could see. kids could kinda see it. great movie, right? i rewatched it recently. it’s a very weird movie. marty mcfly is a 17-year-old high school student whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist. and, i shit you not, they never explain how they became friends. they never explain it. not even in a lazy way, like, “hey, remember when we met in the science building?” they don’t even do that. and we were all fine with it. we were just like, “what, who’s his best friend? a disgraced nuclear physicist? all right, proceed.” what a strange movie to sell to be a family movie. two guys had to go in and do that. they had to be like, “okay… we got an idea… for the next big family-action-comedy. all right, it’s about a guy named marty, and he’s very lazy. he’s always sleeping late.” “okay. is he cool like ferris bueller?” “no. but he does have this best friend who’s, you know, a disgraced… nuclear physicist.” “i’m confused here. this best friend, this is another student?” “no, no, no. no, this guy’s either, like, 40 or 80. even we don’t know how old this guy’s supposed to be. but one day, the boy and the scientist, they go back in time and they build a time machine. whoa!” “okay. i think i see where you’re going here. they build a time machine, and they go back in time, and they stop the kennedy assassination.” “ah! oh, wow, that’s a really good idea, i mean, we didn’t even think of that.” “all right, well, what do they do with the time machine?” “well, now i’m embarrassed to say. ah, well, all right, all right, all right. we thought… we thought it would be funny, you know, if the boy, if he went back in time and, you know, he tried to fuck his mom.” “i don’t know. we thought that’d be fun for people. but, no, good point. no, he doesn’t get to, he doesn’t get to. ‘cause this family friend named biff, he comes in and he tries to rape the mom in front of the son. the dad’s gotta beat the rapist off of her. and also, we’re gonna imply that a white man wrote ‘johnny b. goode.’ so, we’re gonna take that away from ’em.” “well, this is the best movie idea i have ever heard in my life. we’re gonna make three of them. now, you say they go to the past. how about we call it back to the past?” “no, no, no. back to the future.” “right, but they go to the past.” “yeah.” kids have it very good now. my friend’s a teacher. she told me that, uh… the parents will take the kids’ side over the teacher now. that’s insane. that never happened. my parents trusted every grown-up… more than they trusted me. i don’t mean coaches and teachers. any human adult’s word… was better than mine. any hobo or drifter could have taken me by the ear up to my front door and been like, “excuse me! your kid bit my dick.” and my mom would be like, “john edmund mulaney, did you bite this nice man’s dick?” and i would be the only one who’s like, “hey, doesn’t anyone wanna know why… his dick was near my biters… in the first place? isn’t anyone curious… as to how i had access?” don’t get me wrong, my parents love us. they just didn’t like us. we weren’t friends. people are now like, “my mom’s my best friend.” i was like, “oh, is she a super bad mom?” my parents didn’t trust us, and they shouldn’t have trusted us. we were little goblins. we were terrible. i remember, one time, we were going to this resort for a vacation when we were little kids. three weeks before we went to the resort, my dad sat us down and he said, “all right, we’re going to a resort, and i’ve just been informed that the man who owns the resort only has one arm.” and we were like, “oh, yes! yay! yes!” “now, i’m telling you three weeks in advance, so that you will not freak out when you see that he only has one arm.” “oh, we’re gonna freak out so bad!” “yes, john, you have a question?” “how did he lose his arm?” “that’s exactly what you won’t ask.” and then i did ask. i went into the kitchen one day, and i was like, “so, how’d you lose your arm?” and he was like, “well, i was born with only one arm.” and i was like, “nah.” no, my parents loved us. it’s just, like, they were the cops, you know? and we were criminals. so, we didn’t get along. we only got along in that way that, like, cops will sometimes be chummy with criminals. like, when my dad and i would talk, it was like that scene in the movie heat, when robert de niro and al pacino sit down in that diner. we kind of had that rapport of, like, “hmm, we’re not so different, you and i. you have your law practice, and me, i have all these fucking markers.” “i guess we both have responsibilities when you look at it that way.” my dad would respect it if i could get away with breaking a rule. we had a rule in our house, you were not allowed to watch tv on a school night. so, every school night, i would 100% be watching tv. and i would hear my dad coming, i would immediately turn the tv off and grab any book, magazine, periodical, anything. and i’d open it and pretend to be doing homework. my dad would walk in the room and he would go, “what are you doing? are you watching tv?” and i’d go, “no, man. i’m not watching tv.” and the tv wouldn’t even be dark yet. it would still have, like, a neon green halo around it. it’d be sizzling like a glass of pepsi. and i would look my dad in the eyes and go, “no, i’m just reading this yellow pages.” my dad loved us. he just didn’t care about our general happiness or self-esteem. i remember, one time, we were really little kids. i have two sisters and a brother, and all four of us were in our family car ride for three hours going to wisconsin. my dad was driving, going down the highway in our white van with wood around the side. ‘cause you remember when you wanted your car to be made of wood? you remember that era? where we were like, “how much wood can we get on this car… without it catching on fire?” but then the big announcement. “we here at plymouth-chrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood safely on the outside of your car, for all those times you’ve looked at your minivan and thought, ‘huh! it needs a belt.'” so, we’re going on the highway. we’ve been on the road for three hours. and in the distance, we see a mcdonald’s. we see the golden arches. and we got so excited. we started chanting, “mcdonald’s! mcdonald’s! mcdonald’s! mcdonald’s!” and my dad pulled into the drive-thru, and we started cheering. and then, he ordered one black coffee for himself. and kept driving. and, you know, as mad as that made me as a little kid, in retrospect, that is the funniest thing i have ever seen in my entire life. how perfect is that? he had a vanload of little kids, and he got black coffee. the one thing from mcdonald’s no child could enjoy. my dad is cold-blooded. he once shushed a kid during lion king on broadway. that actually happened. we were at lion king on broadway, and there was a five-year-old behind us going, “look, it’s pumbaa! look, it’s timon!” and my dad turned around and said, “are you going to talk the entire time?” he’s my hero. the weirdest thing when i was a kid was how much they scared us about smoking weed. they scared us about it constantly. and i’ve been on tour this year… marijuana is legal in 18 or 19 states in some form or another. it’s insane. yeah, well… all right, don’t “whoo” if you’re white. it’s always been legal for us. come on, sir. we don’t go to jail for marijuana, you silly billy. when i was arrested with a one-hitter at a rusted root concert, i did not serve hard time. i think i got an award. eighteen or 19 states. and, by the way, i agree, it’s a very good thing. but it’s also a really weird thing, because this is the first time i’ve ever seen a law change because the government is just like, “fine.” you know? i’ve never seen it before. like, gay marriage and healthcare, we have to battle it out in the supreme court, and be like, “gay people are humans.” and they’re like, “we’ll think about it.” but with weed, it was just something we wanted really badly, and we kept asking them for 40 years, like, “excuse me.” and then suddenly the government became like cool parents, and they’re just like, “okay, here. take a little. we’d rather you do it in the house than go somewhere else… blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.” those stupid parents. and that’s a big deal because they scared us about weed constantly. it would be on our sitcoms. we’d be watching saved by the bell, we’d be having a great old time. and then, suddenly, a character we had not seen before would show up with some weed and the episode would stop cold in its tracks. and they’d always hold the joint… the bad guy would hold the joint in a villainous way. they’d always offer the joint in a way that no one ever holds a joint. like it’s a skull in a shakespeare play. and now it’s legal, and that is great news. unless you’re a weed dealer, and then it is terrible news. and i don’t just mean because they’re about to lose out to amazon.com. i more feel bad for weed dealers ’cause they’re about to find out that we only showed them a certain amount of politeness because they had an illegal product. and we don’t show that same politeness to people who deliver legal products. like, when the chinese food delivery guy comes, we don’t let him hang out after he’s delivered the chinese food. and we don’t look the other way when he says weird shit to the girls we’re hanging out with… to try to preserve the relationship. and we definitely don’t give him some of the chinese food. he’s never like, “hey, can i get in on those dumplings?” and we’re like, “yeah, we’re all friends.” what are you, on your phone? hey, v-neck. hey! – what’s your name? – sam. sam? cool! what do you do to afford v-necks, sam? typing numbers. ah… numbers, the letters of math. i’m sorry to bother you. i don’t mean to single you out. i hate when people get pulled out of the audience. like, are you familiar with the cirque du soleil, sam? they’re a group of french assholes that are slowly taking over america by humiliating audience members one by one. we once went to see cirque du soleil at navy pier when i was a kid, and my brother came, and he was 12 years old. you remember being 12, when you’re like, “no one look at me or i’ll kill myself.” and these french bastards come into the crowd, being like, “le volunteer!” and they pulled my brother up on stage, and i was like, “no!” and they brought him up, and they reached into his sweatshirt, and they were like… and they had planted a bra, and they pulled out a bra and they were like… and everyone at navy pier was like “ah, ha, ha, ha, ha!” and my brother was like, “that’s great!” i have had other jobs besides comedy. i was an office temp for a while. i really miss that. i loved being a temp, because i would just go from office to office and be terrible at a different job for a week. and then you just get to retire like lou gehrig. you’re like, “thank you. no one will ever see me again.” and they’re like, “goodbye!” i worked at an office once on 57th street in new york city. i was there for a couple weeks. i was in a cubicle next to this other cubicle. this woman named mischa sat in the other cubicle. i want to get the number right. i think mischa had… about 900,000 photos of her daughter up in her cubicle. almost like she was trying to solve a conspiracy about her daughter, a beautiful mind-style. i think about mischa two times a week… because of a phone call she had next to me one day. it was one of my first days, and i was sitting next to her. and her phone rang, and this was her call, and i’m quoting. her phone rang and she said, “hello? hush!” and then she hung up. think about that two times a week. and i didn’t know her well enough by then to be like, “hey, what kind of a person are you?” you know? who could she have been talking to? “hello? hush!” this was a place of business. my only thought was that it was the ceo of the company being like, “mischa, help. i’m doing a crossword puzzle. i need a four-letter word for ‘be quiet’ right now.” – “hush!” – “you’re promoted.” i temped at a little web company on 25th street in new york city. it was a small web company owned by this old man who was old, old, old money new york. his name was henry j. finch iv. like old, old, old money. like, his money was in molasses or something. he owned this web company. i have no idea why he owned this web company. i think he won it in a rich man’s game of dice and small binoculars, or something. mr. finch wore linen suits. he had suspenders, he had a bow tie, he had a hat, he had a cane with an ivory handle. i’m giving you more description than you need, ’cause i need you to believe me. this was a real person i knew in the 21st century. mr. finch was in his 70s. he had an assistant named mary. she was in her 50s, she was korean. i don’t know why he had an assistant. he did not need one. unless he needed someone to be like, “remember, mr. finch, at five o’clock, you need to keep looking like a hard-boiled egg.” one day, mr. finch came into the office. it had been raining. everything i’m about to say to you was said in front of me on that afternoon. mr. finch walked into the office, and he was wearing a raincoat, he was wearing a rain hat, and he had his cane. and he walked in and he said, and i’m quoting, “ah! one feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet! and when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” and then mary yelled, “ooh, ducklings!” to which mr. finch replied, “too old to be a duckling. quack, quack.” and then walked into his office. i think about that every goddamn day. i mean, imagine you’re me. you’re a 22-year-old temp, and you’re so hungover, and you just wanna die every day. and then that happens in front of you, and i don’t know, gives you hope? and i did that a little fast. let me break that conversation down for you. mr. finch walked in, and he began a conversation the way anyone would. “ah!” “one feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet!” the rain. “and when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” now, that’s debatable. but rather than debate that point, mary brought up a new, separate, but interesting point… which was, “ducklings!” but mr. finch, ever the realist about his own age and mortality… said, “ah, too old to be a duckling!” as if to say, “my duckling days are behind me. mary, don’t you see? i’m a duck now. and to prove it… well, i’ll say just about the most famous catchphrase a duck has… ‘quack, quack.'” and i knew right at that moment, by the way, that it meant nothing to mr. finch, what he had said. crazy people are like that. they have unlimited crazy currency. like, if i had gone into his office a couple weeks later and been like, “hey, finch, you remember that time you were like, ‘too old to be a duckling. quack, quack’?” he would just be like, “ah, perhaps i did quack! but such is life for an old knickerbocker like me.” like, he’d say something else crazy. that’s the wonderful thing about crazy people, you know? is that they just have unlimited currency. the things they say mean nothing to them, but they mean everything to me. i was once walking into penn station in new york. i was walking down 31st street towards eighth avenue. i’m walking down 31st, there’s this woman standing at eighth and 31st. i have my little roller suitcase. you can all imagine. i’m walking towards her. she’s smoking a cigarette that is not lit anymore. she’s watching me walk, kind of scanning me up and down, as if she had terminator vision… where she could see little bits of data, like, “little honky ass,” and could read information. as i walked past her, she said this to me. i walked past her and she said, and i’m quoting, “eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” very dirty, yes? a very upsetting thing to hear, yes? i’m sorry you all had to hear that, but at least you all got to hear it as a group. i was alone out there that afternoon. and she said this totally unprompted. “eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” it wasn’t like i had paused in front of her and been like, “what should i do with my life?” so, i walk away from her with this to-do list. and i like structure, i like a to-do list. it did dawn on me that that list of things does get better as it goes along, when you really think about it. ‘cause it starts in a pretty rough place. it starts with just about the worst task a to-do list can start with. but by the end, you have your own small business. and isn’t that the american dream when all’s said and done? that if you eat enough ass and suck enough dick, one day you can sell drugs. imagine you did all that to sell drugs and then they legalize drugs, and you were like, “but i…” this has been a real thrill to perform here, by the way. i just wanna say that in all sincerity. thanks for coming to this. really, really appreciate it. i wanna tell you one more story before i get out of here, about the night i met a guy named bill clinton. now, i don’t… some of you know who that is? for those of you that don’t, he was president of the united states from 1993 until 2001, and he is a smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declared emperor of the united states of america. now, i know you know who bill clinton is. but i was doing a show at a college, and i mentioned bill clinton, and, like, they kind of didn’t know who he was. like, sorry, they knew the name, right? but they only knew this 2015 bill clinton, who’s a very different bill clinton. have you seen his ass lately? what the hell is he trying to pull? he’s all thin now, and he wears these little tight suits, and he’s got these grandpa reading glasses, like, “hey, i can’t do nothing to nobody no more.” “oh, me? i’m just an old, old man. i don’t have the appetites.” you know? and he’s always flying around the world with bill gates trying to cure aids. that is not the bill clinton that we all signed up for 20 years ago. our bill clinton was like a big, fat buddy garrity from friday night lights-looking guy, who played the saxophone on arsenio, and his work in the std community was not in curing anything at that time. that was the man we all elected president. that was the bill clinton that i met. i got to meet bill clinton when he was governor clinton in 1992, when he was first running for president. and i got to meet bill clinton because my parents had gone to the same college as bill clinton. they’re a little younger, but they went to the same college. so, when he was first running for president, he would have all these big, like, alumni fundraisers, and everyone who went was invited to go. now, this was really cool for a couple reasons. one, i got to meet bill clinton. but two, i got to watch my parents watch someone they went to school with become the president. and that is super funny to see, ’cause think about some of the people you went to school with. now imagine they’re becoming the president. imagine sam was becoming the president. it would stir up strong emotions. and my parents had very different opinions on bill clinton. my mom loved bill clinton, ’cause bill clinton was always a really charismatic, handsome guy. i mean, think about how many women he got in the 1990s when he looked like frank caliendo doing john madden. now… imagine him as a college student. and my mom tells me that there was this sort of chivalrous policy on campus back then, where, late at night, if female students were leaving the library unaccompanied, male students were encouraged to wait out in front and offer to walk them home. that sounds good, right? so, my mom tells me that bill clinton would be out in front of the library every single night… just being like, “hey, can i walk ya home? hey, can i walk ya home? hey, can i walk ya home? hey, can i walk ya home?” and one night, my mom was leaving the library, and bill clinton was like, “hey, can i walk ya home?” and my mom was like, “hell, yes.” so… this is absolutely true. my mom, little ellen stanton, walked arm-in-arm with bill clinton to her dorm. and she was like, “you know, i wanted to invite him up for a beer.” and i was like, “thanks, i’m nine.” but… her roommate was upstairs, so she lost her chance with bill clinton. now, my dad, on the other hand, hated bill clinton, because my parents were dating during this time. and also, my dad’s a much more morally-upright, conservative kind of guy. he always told me that he hated it in college that bill clinton could, quote, “get away with anything.” can you imagine how he felt later? so, one day, this invitation arrives for a fundraiser where you could meet bill clinton. my mom opens it first and she goes, “oh, we have to go. we have to go see bill.” and without looking up at her, my dad just says, “why? it’s not like he’s gonna remember you.” one black coffee. same motherfucker. so, my mom says, “fine! i’ll go and i’ll take john.” and i was like, “hell, yeah.” and i slid in the room in my first communion suit, ready to go. ‘cause i loved bill clinton. i was ten years old. if you were a kid when bill clinton was first released, it was the most exciting thing ever. we’d never seen a cool politician before. and he would go on mtv, and he’d have cool answers to kids’ questions. they’d be like, “governor, what’s your favorite food?” and he’d be like, “i don’t know, fries?” and we’d be like, “yay, we eat fries!” i learned to play his campaign song on the piano. it was “don’t stop” by fleetwood mac… from rumours, an album written by and for people cheating on each other. he let us know who he was right away. so, i went with my mom, as her date… to reconnect with governor bill clinton. we walked into the ballroom. it was a big hotel ballroom. it was the palmer house hilton, big hilton hotel ballroom. walked into the ballroom, it was packed with people. it’s actually the ballroom from the end of the movie the fugitive, remember? so, that ballroom. so, my mom and i walk in, it’s packed with people, the… sorry, the end where harrison ford, as dr. richard kimble, bursts in to confront dr. charles nichols, right? okay. so, that ballroom. so, my mom and i walk in, it’s packed with people. why does kimble confront nichols? well, i know we all know this, but… no, no. but, but, but… kimble, he found out that nichols, along with devlin macgregor and lentz, who has mysteriously died, they had hired frederick sykes, the one-armed man, to kill kimble. kimble’s wife wasn’t even the target. i know we all know this. but they were gonna kill kimble because he wasn’t gonna approve certain liver samples to pass rud-90. so, kimble finds out about all of this, and, of course, he’s furious. and he bursts into the ballroom and he goes, “you switched the samples!” and dr. nichols is like, “ladies and gentlemen, my friend, dr. richard kimble.” what accent did that guy have, by the way? he goes, “you switched the samples! and you doctored your research! so that you could have provasic!” anyway, so it’s that ballroom. so, we walk into that ballroom. it was packed with people. it was packed with people. a real who’s not of chicago celebrities. walter jacobson was there. walter jacobson was the local fox anchor. he’d do fun things where he’d go undercover as a homeless person. and he’d be like, “oh, what time is the soup?” and they’d be like, “man, you’re walter jacobson.” he was there. everybody. and on the far side of the ballroom, under a spotlight, we saw a little bit of silver hair. and it was him… bill clinton. the comeback kid. but he was surrounded by reporters, and photographers, and secret service. so, what are you gonna do? well, if you’re my mom, you ball up the back of my sport coat, and you push me forward like a human shield. and then you start jogging while yelling, “this ten-year-old boy has to meet the next president of the united states!” kind of implying that i might be dying. my feet were not on the ground. she was swinging me like a snowplow. i was just mowing down fat chicago democrats. i pushed past all the reporters, i pushed past all the photographers. we pushed past all the secret service. we land at bill clinton’s feet. bill clinton turns, looks at my mom and says, “hey, ellen,” ’cause he never forgets a bitch, ever. my mom melts. she goes, “hi, bill.” then it is revealed that she has no plan. so… she pushes me towards clinton and she goes, “this is my son, john, and he’s also going to be president.” and i was like, “what the hell are you talking about? i’m not gonna be president.” and i know now that i’m definitely never gonna be president. not unless everyone gets real cool about a bunch of stuff really quickly. based on my ten-year-old memory, bill clinton is about 13 feet tall. and he leaned down, because, well, i was wearing this button that i bought outside the fundraiser. it was a cartoon button of george h. w. bush, and it had a quail flying over his head, and it was shitting on his head. and it said, “bird-brained.” and i thought it was very funny. and bill clinton leaned down so that only i could hear and he said, “hey, man, i like your button.” and i said, “you can do whatever you want forever.” and he took my advice. and… it was the best night of my entire life. and i got home that night… i got home that night, and my dad was still awake, like, reading angry under one lamp, just like… and i went up to him and i went, “hey! i’m gonna be a democrat.” “and i’m gonna vote for bill clinton.” and without looking up at me, my dad just said, “you have the moral backbone of a chocolate éclair.” you know, how you talk to a child. so, here’s the end of that story. that was 1992. let’s flash forward five years to 1997. it is now 1997. i am a sophomore in high school, bill clinton is in his second term as president. and on the morning that the monica lewinsky scandal breaks on the cover of the new york times. it had been on the drudge report, and then it was on the cover of the new york times. that morning, i wake up to the newspaper hitting me in the face. i am a teenager asleep in bed, and the newspaper hits me in the face and falls open on my stomach. and i open my eyes to see my dad standing there dressed for work, and he says, “the other shoe just dropped.” and then my dad went in to work to find out that his law firm had been hired to defend bill clinton. good night, chicago. your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * \n",

            "armed with boyish charm and a sharp wit, the former “snl” writer john mulaney offers sly takes on marriage, his beef with babies and the time he met bill clinton all right, petunia. wish me luck out there. you will die on august 7th, 2037. that’s pretty good. all right. hello. hello, chicago. nice to see you again. thank you. that was very nice. thank you. look, now, you’re a wonderful crowd, but i need you to keep your energy up the entire show, okay? because… no, no, no. thank you. some crowds… some crowds, they have big energy in the beginning and then they run out of places to go. so… i don’t judge those crowds, by the way, okay? we’ve all gone too big too fast and then run out of room. we’ve all made a “happy birthday” sign… wait. you get that poster board up, and you’re like, “i don’t need to trace it. i know how big letters should be. to begin with, a big-ass ‘h’. followed by a big-ass ‘a’ and… oh, no! oh, god! okay, all right. real skinny ‘p’ with a high hump, and then we’ll put the second ‘p’ below the hump of that first ‘p’, sort of like a motorcycle sidecar situation. and now i have no room for the ‘y’, so i’ll do a kind of curled-up noodle ‘y’. block letters and cursive look good together.” and then you go to write “birthday” and you totally forget the lesson you just learned with “happy.” you’re like, “yeah, but the past is the past. big-ass ‘b’. surely more letters will fit in the same space.” you’re very friendly here in chicago. i mean, we’re all violent here, but you’re very friendly. no, really. and i don’t like confrontation, ’cause i’ve never been in a fight before. though, maybe you could tell that from the first moment i walked out on stage. i don’t give off that vibe. some people give off a vibe of… right away, they’re like, “do not fuck with me.” my vibe is more like, “hey, you could pour soup in my lap and i’ll probably apologize to you.” when i walk, for real, my feet go out like this. i’m so open and vulnerable. i look like a doll that you point out molestation on. “show us on this white comedian where the man touched you.” it’s been a while since i’ve been home to chicago. i got married since then. thank you. i married my wife. i love saying “my wife.” it sounds so adult. “that’s my wife.” it’s great, you sound like a person. i said it even before we were married. we were just dating, and we were once getting on an airplane, and anna’s ticket didn’t say anything and my ticket said “priority access.” it doesn’t matter why. but we were getting on and i said, “uh, can my wife board with me?” and they were like, “yes, of course. right this way.” and i was like, “oh, that is so much better than all those times i was like, ‘can my girlfriend come?'” and, yeah, i shouldn’t have said it that way, but still. “my wife” just has some kick-ass to it, you know? “get away from my wife! no one talk to my wife!” marriage is gonna be very magical. “i didn’t kill my wife!” that’s like, “ooh, who’s that fella? i bet he did kill his wife.” being married is so nice. i never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself. that’s not really a joke, that’s just a little sweet thing i like to say. ‘cause i’d been in relationships where i got cheated on, like, long ones. i don’t know if you’ve ever been in a long relationship where you got cheated on, but it changes your whole worldview. ‘cause when i was a kid, i used to watch america’s most wanted. you know how kids do. and i would always think to myself, “how could another person kill someone? how could a human being kill another human being?” and then i got cheated on, and i was like, “oh, okay.” “i’m not gonna do it, but i totally get it.” and i don’t mean in that way of, like, “no one else can have you.” i don’t care about that. it’s just creepy to have an ex out there after things have ended badly. they have a lot of information. anyone who’s seen my dick and met my parents needs to die. i can’t have them roaming around. i talked to a lot of people before i got engaged, you know. and i heard this expression about whether or not you should get married. this is an old expression. people say this. they say, “why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” you ever heard that before? it’s a bananas insulting expression… to an entire gender. but also, it makes no sense. “why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” you’re not allowed to milk a cow that you don’t own. that’s not even a situation. was that a problem at one point? like, in the dairy community? was that happening a hundred years ago in some village? some dutch prick was sneaking in at night being like, “ah-ha-ha, i take your milk.” and the farmer was like, “well, then, this is your cow now.” and he was like, “no, no proof of purchase.” and he ran off into the night. that sounded dutch, right? you know what that… you know what that expression means? it means, “why would you marry a woman if she’s already having sex with you?” which has nothing to do with what relationships are even like anymore. now, it’s like, “why buy the cow?” uh, maybe because, every day, the cow asks you when you’re gonna buy it. and… … you live in a really small apartment with the cow, so you can’t avoid that question at all. and also, the cow is way better at arguing than you are. and the cow grew up in a family that knows how to argue. “why buy the cow?” uh, maybe because every time another cow gets bought, you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale, and your cow looks over at you the entire time like… and does not enjoy the sale at all… even though she’s the one that wanted to go to the sale. and she’s especially mad because that farmer and cow met, like, eight months after you guys met. “why buy the cow?” well, let’s be real here. you’re very lucky to have the cow that you do have. “roping in cows and getting milk out of them was never anything you were known for, john.” by the most liberal of estimates, there have been about eight cows total, several unmilked, and… a lot of people think that you like bulls, and if you just bought… they assume it. when you search your name, the third thing to come up is like, “john mulaney bull?” and if you just bought the cow, nobody would say that anymore. they’ll still say it. ‘cause there are those guys who, they buy a cow, and then on the side, total matador, but… but, for real, chicago, why buy the cow? let’s be real. why buy the cow? because you love her. you really do. and, yeah, yeah… sure, she’s a bossy little jew, but… … she takes care of you. and you don’t wanna be some old man stumbling around, like, “hey, you seen any loose milk?” my wife is jewish. she’s a new york jew. i did it! now, i was raised catholic. i don’t know if you can tell that from the everything about me. my wife is jewish, i grew up catholic, so we got married by a friend. being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families’ religions, while confusing the elderly people at the wedding. “what’s the name of the bishop?” “that’s actually stand-up comedian dan levy. he was the host of mtv’s your face or mine?” i saw a lot of catholic weddings, though, because i was an altar boy… and a hush falls over the room. isn’t it weird how that became a scandalous thing? that was just some boring shit i had to do on weekends. but now, it’s like saying, “i was a french maid for a period of time. i was treated well in my day. i worked for a variety of sirs.” no, being an altar boy was just a boring gig, you know? you’d serve mass and then you’d serve weddings sometimes. my brother was once an altar boy at a wedding, and he was standing there with another altar boy in this big, packed church in chicago where we grew up. and the bride was coming down the aisle, and the organ was playing, and all the pews were filled, and the bride got all the way to the altar, and the groom lifted the veil off of the bride, and right at that moment the other altar boy said, “aw, she’s ugly.” and then they looked, and they were right next to the video camera. and i know that’s awful, but wouldn’t you give a million dollars to see that wedding video? it was the best moment of this stupid woman’s life, and she’s walking down the aisle, and the organ’s like… and she gets all the way to the altar to her betrothed, and he unveils her to the world and to the eyes of god. and right at that second, for no reason at all, some cheeto-fingered, rat-mustached, 13-year-old prick decides to go, “aw, she’s ugly!” hopefully the videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it to be like, “aw, she’s beautiful. she’s enchanting.” i grew up catholic. i don’t go to church anymore. but i went on christmas eve with my parents, ’cause you know how you lie to your parents. so… we go into the church and i was like, “i got this under control.” and then i got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit. no, i was going through mass and i was batting, like, .400. and then in the middle of mass, the priest said, “peace be with you.” and everyone said, “and with your spirit.” and i was the one pre-y2k asshole going, “and also with you. what? huh? what? huh? what? when? when?” for those of you that aren’t catholic, i don’t mean to exclude you, even though we love to exclude you, but… there’s a part in church where the priest says, “peace be with you.” and for many, many years, we all said… – “and also with you.” – very good. but they changed it to “and with your spirit.” because that’s what needed revamping in the catholic church. that was the squeaky wheel that needed the grease. in rome, they were like, “let’s see. what problems can we solve? problem one. no.” i’m actually glad they changed that, though. i never liked “and also with you.” i always found that clunky. “and also with you.” that’s not how you talk. – “have a nice day.” – “and also you having one.” it’s just a little bit wrong, isn’t it? it’s just a little off. like, when someone’s like, “how are you?” and you’re like, “nothing much.” and it sort of makes sense. never begin a sentence with “and also.” you just immediately sound caught off-guard. it sounds like if at the first church ever, like, they weren’t expecting it. like, the priest was like, “hey, this is the first time we’ve ever had church. i just wanna say, ‘peace be with you.'” and they were like… “what? oh. uh, yeah. and also you should have some.” “hey, that’s good. let’s keep that for 2,000 years. and then change it to trick john.” my wife and i don’t have any children, we have a dog. we have a little puppy named petunia. she’s a tiny little french bulldog puppy. i like having a puppy that’s a bulldog, ’cause it’s like having a baby that is also a grandma. her body is young, her face is as old as time. she definitely saw the nazis march into paris. she always gives me this look of like, “oh, the things i have seen, you cocksucker. you have no idea. the gestapo threw my printing press into a river. but, go, tell your fucking jokes. bring me my dish.” she said that. petunia… petunia is my best friend in the world. i give her a million kisses a day. she does not like me, and barks at me and bites me all day long. we had to get a dog trainer into the apartment because petunia is a bad dog. we tell her that every day. we go, “hey, you’re bad at being a dog.” so, the trainer came into the apartment. sorry, didn’t even walk into the apartment, walked into the threshold and went, “oh, okay.” like she was an exorcist or something. she said, “i see what the problem is.” she said, “petunia has become the alpha of the house.” and then she pointed at me, she said, “you are no longer the alpha of the house.” and in the back of my head, i was like, “i was never the alpha of the house.” i turned to my wife, i was like, “let’s pretend. it’ll be fun. yes… my title of alpha, which i once had, how can i reclaim it? because that was a thing that existed at one time.” she said, “you need to show dominance over your puppy.” these are things people say to me. i said, “how do i do that?” she said, “well, let me ask you this. who eats dinner first, you or petunia?” i was like, “petunia eats dinner first. she eats dinner at 5:00 p.m., ’cause she’s a foot long and two years old.” she said, “no, you need to eat dinner first. because the king eats before anyone else eats.” oh, yes, and what a mighty king i will be, eating dinner at 4:45 in the afternoon. “look upon your sovereign, petunia, and tremble. my lands stretch across this entire one bedroom, and i eat dinner whenever i choose, as long as it works for the schedule of a dog.” she said, “now, you don’t actually have to eat dinner before petunia. you just have to convince petunia that you’ve already eaten.” so… for the past month, i shit you not… before my wife and i give petunia her dish, we take down empty bowls and spoons, and in front of her, we go, “mmm, dinner. mmm, good dinner.” like we’re space aliens in a play about human beings that they wrote, but they didn’t work that hard on. “mmm, we’re eating dinner.” meanwhile, petunia’s just staring at us with her paul giamatti face, like… “you’re not eating dinner, cocksucker. dish, now.” i have a wife and a dog, and we just bought a house. we have a new house. it was built in the ’20s, but it was flipped in 2014. which means it’s haunted, but it has a lovely kitchen backsplash. actually, we didn’t buy a house. a bank bought a house, and i’m allowed to keep my shirts and pants there while i pay it off for 30 years. the woman from the bank came over and she showed me my mortgage broken down month by month for 30 years. and she said, “so, for instance, this is what you’ll pay in july of 2029.” and i burst out laughing. i was like, “2029? that’s not a real year. by 2029, i’ll be drinking moon juice with president jonathan taylor thomas. i’m not gonna be writing you a paper check.” i like having a house, but i loved looking for a house, ’cause i love real estate agents. i mean, they are the true heroes. they really are. have you ever watched hgtv? real estate agents have to deal with the dumbest people in the world making the biggest decisions of their lives. every episode of hgtv is like, “craig and stacia are looking for a two-story a-frame that’s near craig’s job in the downtown, but also satisfies stacia’s need to be near the beach which is nowhere near craig’s job. with three children and nine on the way, and a max budget of $7… let’s see what lori jo can do on this week’s episode of you don’t deserve a beach house.” i loved our real estate agent. it was so fun to hang out with her. it was like hanging out with my mom. ‘cause, you know, real estate agents always look like your mom. and they have various chico’s accoutrements. they always have kind of fun mom energy. and they’re always, “so excited to see you two.” we would have little conferences before we walked into a house. she’d go, “let’s talk. let’s talk before we go in.” we’re, like, two feet from the door. “so, there’s no toilets. and i know that was on your list. but i think i can get him to budge. let’s go.” so, we’d have a real estate agent, and then, like, the house would have a real estate agent who’s just some guy sitting in a big chair. and these two always hated each other. they’d be like, “hi, tony.” “hi, kim.” it’s like, “jesus christ! what, were you two in the eagles together? what is the animosity about?” our real estate agent wanted us to have a baby more than anyone else in our lives, more than anyone in our family. she hinted about it constantly. every room she walked into, she’d be like, “so, this could be an office.” “or maybe a nursery.” “yeah. no, like we said, we don’t know if we’re gonna have… ” “no, no. i know, i know, you know. you don’t know if you’re gonna have ’em, but you know. you know, you never know. sometimes you don’t know what’s gonna happen, and then… you know, something happens.” “well, yeah, that’s how all of life works.” “okay, all right. okay. uh-huh. mmm. this is an on-fire garbage can. could be a nursery.” she showed me a backyard once. she goes, “i don’t even like this backyard for you.” i was like, “oh, do tell.” she said, “it’s all pavement. i think you should have some grass out there. you know, in case you have a couple… little guys… running around in the grass.” and i got offended on behalf of my imaginary kids. i was like, “hey, lady. i went outside about as much as powder from the movie powder. my children are not gonna be playing out on grass. they will be up in their rooms playing violent video games and catfishing pedophiles. these are my children. and that’s my wife!” i didn’t mean to make it sound like we don’t want children. we don’t, but i didn’t mean to make it sound like that. see, i just don’t think babies like me very much. sometimes babies will point at me, and i don’t care for that shit at all. like, i’ll be on an elevator, and a baby will be there in its big, like, stroller activity tray, just, like, working on one cheerio with bobby fischer-like intensity. and it’ll look up at me and go… i like to lean in and go, “stop snitchin’, motherfucker.” and then walk off. ‘cause you’re never too young to learn our national no-snitching policy. my friends have babies and i don’t do so well with them. i had a run-in with a two-year-old girl. i know there are better ways to start that story, but… my friend, jeremy, has this two-year-old girl, and i really like her. she’s a sweet kid. i really like his daughter a lot. but i was over at his family’s house for the fourth of july, and he had his daughter on his knee. and it was a very lovely day. his whole extended family was there. and he was bouncing his two-year-old up and down, and he pointed at me and he said to his two-year-old, “do you know who that is? that’s your uncle john.” and i was like, “oh, my god. that’s so sweet. i’m her uncle john.” and then the baby pointed at me and said, “uncle john has a penis.” i thank you for laughing, because no one did that day! fell deadly silent, is what they all did. hey, do you know what you’re supposed to say when a baby points at you and knowingly says, “he has a penis”? no, i’m asking, ’cause i don’t know what to say in that situation. here’s what i went with that day. i said, “oh, come on!” i don’t know. i thought that’d be good. but then it just made it worse, ’cause it sounded like the baby and i had an arrangement not to talk about it, and she had violated my trust. like, the baby had been like, “do you have a penis?” and i was like, “yes, i do, but you’re a baby, so discretion is key.” and then the next day she goes, “he has a penis,” and i go, “oh, come on! someone can’t keep a secret!” luckily, jeremy’s wife saved the day. the baby’s mom saved the day. she came in and she picked up the baby, and she was like, “it’s okay. she’s just going through that phase where she says penis and vagina a lot.” aren’t we all? and, by the way, it would’ve been a totally different situation if the baby had said vagina. like, if a grown woman had walked in the room, and the baby had been like, “she has a vagina,” the woman could be like, “yes, i do, and it’s magnificent.” and we would all be like, “hooray! you are brave!” no one wants to applaud the penis of a 32-year-old weirdo. it’s fun to be married. i’ve never been supervised before. i’m supervised. she studies what i do. like an anthropologist. she’ll be like, “sometimes, he will watch a movie on tv even though he already owns that movie on dvd. pointing this out to him confuses and upsets him.” i had no supervision when i was a kid. we were free to do what we wanted. but also, with that, no one cared about kids. i grew up before children were special. i did. very early ’80s, right before children became special. like, i remember when milk carton kids became a thing. when they were like, “hey, we should start looking for some of these guys. i don’t think they’re just blowing off steam.” no one cared about my opinion when i was a little kid. no one cared what i thought. sometimes, people would say, “what do you think you’re doing?” but that just meant “stop.” they didn’t actually wanna know my thought process. they didn’t want me to be like, “well, i was gonna put this bottle rocket into this carton of eggs, so that when i lit off the bottle rocket, the eggs would explode everywhere.” “oh, well, that’s very interesting. and what brought you to this experiment?” “oh, well, thank you for asking. well… you know how i’m filled with rage? i’m so horny and angry all the time… and i have no outlet for it. so… eggs.” your opinion doesn’t matter in elementary school either. it matters in college. college is just your opinion. just you raising your hand and being like, “i think emily dickinson’s a lesbian.” and they’re like, “partial credit.” and that’s a whole thing. but in elementary school, it doesn’t matter what you think, it just matters what you know. you have to have answers to questions. and if you say, “i don’t know,” you get an x on your test, and you get it wrong and that’s not fair, ’cause your brain has never been smaller. also, that’s not how life works. i’m in my 30s now. if you came to me now and you were like, “hey, john, name three things that the stamp act of 1775 accomplished.” i’d go, “i don’t know. get out of my apartment,” you know? but when you’re a little kid, you can’t say, “i don’t know.” you should be able to. that should be an acceptable answer on a test. you should be able to write in, “i don’t know. i know you told me. but i have had a very long day. i am very small. and i have no money. so you can imagine the kind of stress that i am under.” or if it’s one of those true or false questions, you should be able to add a third option which is, “who’s to say?” kids are much more supervised now, but also, they have a lot of rights. like, that’s the biggest civil rights increase i’ve seen in my lifetime. the rights of children have gone through the roof. i had no rights when i was a little kid. i remember, one time, i walked into a supermarket by myself, and i walked in through the double doors, and the woman behind the register just looked at me and she went, “no!” and i went, “all right.” and i turned around and left. that’s how broken i was. and there weren’t special things for kids the way there are now. like, we would just go see movies. any movie. like back to the future. that was a movie everyone could see. kids could kinda see it. great movie, right? i rewatched it recently. it’s a very weird movie. marty mcfly is a 17-year-old high school student whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist. and, i shit you not, they never explain how they became friends. they never explain it. not even in a lazy way, like, “hey, remember when we met in the science building?” they don’t even do that. and we were all fine with it. we were just like, “what, who’s his best friend? a disgraced nuclear physicist? all right, proceed.” what a strange movie to sell to be a family movie. two guys had to go in and do that. they had to be like, “okay… we got an idea… for the next big family-action-comedy. all right, it’s about a guy named marty, and he’s very lazy. he’s always sleeping late.” “okay. is he cool like ferris bueller?” “no. but he does have this best friend who’s, you know, a disgraced… nuclear physicist.” “i’m confused here. this best friend, this is another student?” “no, no, no. no, this guy’s either, like, 40 or 80. even we don’t know how old this guy’s supposed to be. but one day, the boy and the scientist, they go back in time and they build a time machine. whoa!” “okay. i think i see where you’re going here. they build a time machine, and they go back in time, and they stop the kennedy assassination.” “ah! oh, wow, that’s a really good idea, i mean, we didn’t even think of that.” “all right, well, what do they do with the time machine?” “well, now i’m embarrassed to say. ah, well, all right, all right, all right. we thought… we thought it would be funny, you know, if the boy, if he went back in time and, you know, he tried to fuck his mom.” “i don’t know. we thought that’d be fun for people. but, no, good point. no, he doesn’t get to, he doesn’t get to. ‘cause this family friend named biff, he comes in and he tries to rape the mom in front of the son. the dad’s gotta beat the rapist off of her. and also, we’re gonna imply that a white man wrote ‘johnny b. goode.’ so, we’re gonna take that away from ’em.” “well, this is the best movie idea i have ever heard in my life. we’re gonna make three of them. now, you say they go to the past. how about we call it back to the past?” “no, no, no. back to the future.” “right, but they go to the past.” “yeah.” kids have it very good now. my friend’s a teacher. she told me that, uh… the parents will take the kids’ side over the teacher now. that’s insane. that never happened. my parents trusted every grown-up… more than they trusted me. i don’t mean coaches and teachers. any human adult’s word… was better than mine. any hobo or drifter could have taken me by the ear up to my front door and been like, “excuse me! your kid bit my dick.” and my mom would be like, “john edmund mulaney, did you bite this nice man’s dick?” and i would be the only one who’s like, “hey, doesn’t anyone wanna know why… his dick was near my biters… in the first place? isn’t anyone curious… as to how i had access?” don’t get me wrong, my parents love us. they just didn’t like us. we weren’t friends. people are now like, “my mom’s my best friend.” i was like, “oh, is she a super bad mom?” my parents didn’t trust us, and they shouldn’t have trusted us. we were little goblins. we were terrible. i remember, one time, we were going to this resort for a vacation when we were little kids. three weeks before we went to the resort, my dad sat us down and he said, “all right, we’re going to a resort, and i’ve just been informed that the man who owns the resort only has one arm.” and we were like, “oh, yes! yay! yes!” “now, i’m telling you three weeks in advance, so that you will not freak out when you see that he only has one arm.” “oh, we’re gonna freak out so bad!” “yes, john, you have a question?” “how did he lose his arm?” “that’s exactly what you won’t ask.” and then i did ask. i went into the kitchen one day, and i was like, “so, how’d you lose your arm?” and he was like, “well, i was born with only one arm.” and i was like, “nah.” no, my parents loved us. it’s just, like, they were the cops, you know? and we were criminals. so, we didn’t get along. we only got along in that way that, like, cops will sometimes be chummy with criminals. like, when my dad and i would talk, it was like that scene in the movie heat, when robert de niro and al pacino sit down in that diner. we kind of had that rapport of, like, “hmm, we’re not so different, you and i. you have your law practice, and me, i have all these fucking markers.” “i guess we both have responsibilities when you look at it that way.” my dad would respect it if i could get away with breaking a rule. we had a rule in our house, you were not allowed to watch tv on a school night. so, every school night, i would 100% be watching tv. and i would hear my dad coming, i would immediately turn the tv off and grab any book, magazine, periodical, anything. and i’d open it and pretend to be doing homework. my dad would walk in the room and he would go, “what are you doing? are you watching tv?” and i’d go, “no, man. i’m not watching tv.” and the tv wouldn’t even be dark yet. it would still have, like, a neon green halo around it. it’d be sizzling like a glass of pepsi. and i would look my dad in the eyes and go, “no, i’m just reading this yellow pages.” my dad loved us. he just didn’t care about our general happiness or self-esteem. i remember, one time, we were really little kids. i have two sisters and a brother, and all four of us were in our family car ride for three hours going to wisconsin. my dad was driving, going down the highway in our white van with wood around the side. ‘cause you remember when you wanted your car to be made of wood? you remember that era? where we were like, “how much wood can we get on this car… without it catching on fire?” but then the big announcement. “we here at plymouth-chrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood safely on the outside of your car, for all those times you’ve looked at your minivan and thought, ‘huh! it needs a belt.'” so, we’re going on the highway. we’ve been on the road for three hours. and in the distance, we see a mcdonald’s. we see the golden arches. and we got so excited. we started chanting, “mcdonald’s! mcdonald’s! mcdonald’s! mcdonald’s!” and my dad pulled into the drive-thru, and we started cheering. and then, he ordered one black coffee for himself. and kept driving. and, you know, as mad as that made me as a little kid, in retrospect, that is the funniest thing i have ever seen in my entire life. how perfect is that? he had a vanload of little kids, and he got black coffee. the one thing from mcdonald’s no child could enjoy. my dad is cold-blooded. he once shushed a kid during lion king on broadway. that actually happened. we were at lion king on broadway, and there was a five-year-old behind us going, “look, it’s pumbaa! look, it’s timon!” and my dad turned around and said, “are you going to talk the entire time?” he’s my hero. the weirdest thing when i was a kid was how much they scared us about smoking weed. they scared us about it constantly. and i’ve been on tour this year… marijuana is legal in 18 or 19 states in some form or another. it’s insane. yeah, well… all right, don’t “whoo” if you’re white. it’s always been legal for us. come on, sir. we don’t go to jail for marijuana, you silly billy. when i was arrested with a one-hitter at a rusted root concert, i did not serve hard time. i think i got an award. eighteen or 19 states. and, by the way, i agree, it’s a very good thing. but it’s also a really weird thing, because this is the first time i’ve ever seen a law change because the government is just like, “fine.” you know? i’ve never seen it before. like, gay marriage and healthcare, we have to battle it out in the supreme court, and be like, “gay people are humans.” and they’re like, “we’ll think about it.” but with weed, it was just something we wanted really badly, and we kept asking them for 40 years, like, “excuse me.” and then suddenly the government became like cool parents, and they’re just like, “okay, here. take a little. we’d rather you do it in the house than go somewhere else… blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.” those stupid parents. and that’s a big deal because they scared us about weed constantly. it would be on our sitcoms. we’d be watching saved by the bell, we’d be having a great old time. and then, suddenly, a character we had not seen before would show up with some weed and the episode would stop cold in its tracks. and they’d always hold the joint… the bad guy would hold the joint in a villainous way. they’d always offer the joint in a way that no one ever holds a joint. like it’s a skull in a shakespeare play. and now it’s legal, and that is great news. unless you’re a weed dealer, and then it is terrible news. and i don’t just mean because they’re about to lose out to amazon.com. i more feel bad for weed dealers ’cause they’re about to find out that we only showed them a certain amount of politeness because they had an illegal product. and we don’t show that same politeness to people who deliver legal products. like, when the chinese food delivery guy comes, we don’t let him hang out after he’s delivered the chinese food. and we don’t look the other way when he says weird shit to the girls we’re hanging out with… to try to preserve the relationship. and we definitely don’t give him some of the chinese food. he’s never like, “hey, can i get in on those dumplings?” and we’re like, “yeah, we’re all friends.” what are you, on your phone? hey, v-neck. hey! – what’s your name? – sam. sam? cool! what do you do to afford v-necks, sam? typing numbers. ah… numbers, the letters of math. i’m sorry to bother you. i don’t mean to single you out. i hate when people get pulled out of the audience. like, are you familiar with the cirque du soleil, sam? they’re a group of french assholes that are slowly taking over america by humiliating audience members one by one. we once went to see cirque du soleil at navy pier when i was a kid, and my brother came, and he was 12 years old. you remember being 12, when you’re like, “no one look at me or i’ll kill myself.” and these french bastards come into the crowd, being like, “le volunteer!” and they pulled my brother up on stage, and i was like, “no!” and they brought him up, and they reached into his sweatshirt, and they were like… and they had planted a bra, and they pulled out a bra and they were like… and everyone at navy pier was like “ah, ha, ha, ha, ha!” and my brother was like, “that’s great!” i have had other jobs besides comedy. i was an office temp for a while. i really miss that. i loved being a temp, because i would just go from office to office and be terrible at a different job for a week. and then you just get to retire like lou gehrig. you’re like, “thank you. no one will ever see me again.” and they’re like, “goodbye!” i worked at an office once on 57th street in new york city. i was there for a couple weeks. i was in a cubicle next to this other cubicle. this woman named mischa sat in the other cubicle. i want to get the number right. i think mischa had… about 900,000 photos of her daughter up in her cubicle. almost like she was trying to solve a conspiracy about her daughter, a beautiful mind-style. i think about mischa two times a week… because of a phone call she had next to me one day. it was one of my first days, and i was sitting next to her. and her phone rang, and this was her call, and i’m quoting. her phone rang and she said, “hello? hush!” and then she hung up. think about that two times a week. and i didn’t know her well enough by then to be like, “hey, what kind of a person are you?” you know? who could she have been talking to? “hello? hush!” this was a place of business. my only thought was that it was the ceo of the company being like, “mischa, help. i’m doing a crossword puzzle. i need a four-letter word for ‘be quiet’ right now.” – “hush!” – “you’re promoted.” i temped at a little web company on 25th street in new york city. it was a small web company owned by this old man who was old, old, old money new york. his name was henry j. finch iv. like old, old, old money. like, his money was in molasses or something. he owned this web company. i have no idea why he owned this web company. i think he won it in a rich man’s game of dice and small binoculars, or something. mr. finch wore linen suits. he had suspenders, he had a bow tie, he had a hat, he had a cane with an ivory handle. i’m giving you more description than you need, ’cause i need you to believe me. this was a real person i knew in the 21st century. mr. finch was in his 70s. he had an assistant named mary. she was in her 50s, she was korean. i don’t know why he had an assistant. he did not need one. unless he needed someone to be like, “remember, mr. finch, at five o’clock, you need to keep looking like a hard-boiled egg.” one day, mr. finch came into the office. it had been raining. everything i’m about to say to you was said in front of me on that afternoon. mr. finch walked into the office, and he was wearing a raincoat, he was wearing a rain hat, and he had his cane. and he walked in and he said, and i’m quoting, “ah! one feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet! and when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” and then mary yelled, “ooh, ducklings!” to which mr. finch replied, “too old to be a duckling. quack, quack.” and then walked into his office. i think about that every goddamn day. i mean, imagine you’re me. you’re a 22-year-old temp, and you’re so hungover, and you just wanna die every day. and then that happens in front of you, and i don’t know, gives you hope? and i did that a little fast. let me break that conversation down for you. mr. finch walked in, and he began a conversation the way anyone would. “ah!” “one feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet!” the rain. “and when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” now, that’s debatable. but rather than debate that point, mary brought up a new, separate, but interesting point… which was, “ducklings!” but mr. finch, ever the realist about his own age and mortality… said, “ah, too old to be a duckling!” as if to say, “my duckling days are behind me. mary, don’t you see? i’m a duck now. and to prove it… well, i’ll say just about the most famous catchphrase a duck has… ‘quack, quack.'” and i knew right at that moment, by the way, that it meant nothing to mr. finch, what he had said. crazy people are like that. they have unlimited crazy currency. like, if i had gone into his office a couple weeks later and been like, “hey, finch, you remember that time you were like, ‘too old to be a duckling. quack, quack’?” he would just be like, “ah, perhaps i did quack! but such is life for an old knickerbocker like me.” like, he’d say something else crazy. that’s the wonderful thing about crazy people, you know? is that they just have unlimited currency. the things they say mean nothing to them, but they mean everything to me. i was once walking into penn station in new york. i was walking down 31st street towards eighth avenue. i’m walking down 31st, there’s this woman standing at eighth and 31st. i have my little roller suitcase. you can all imagine. i’m walking towards her. she’s smoking a cigarette that is not lit anymore. she’s watching me walk, kind of scanning me up and down, as if she had terminator vision… where she could see little bits of data, like, “little honky ass,” and could read information. as i walked past her, she said this to me. i walked past her and she said, and i’m quoting, “eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” very dirty, yes? a very upsetting thing to hear, yes? i’m sorry you all had to hear that, but at least you all got to hear it as a group. i was alone out there that afternoon. and she said this totally unprompted. “eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” it wasn’t like i had paused in front of her and been like, “what should i do with my life?” so, i walk away from her with this to-do list. and i like structure, i like a to-do list. it did dawn on me that that list of things does get better as it goes along, when you really think about it. ‘cause it starts in a pretty rough place. it starts with just about the worst task a to-do list can start with. but by the end, you have your own small business. and isn’t that the american dream when all’s said and done? that if you eat enough ass and suck enough dick, one day you can sell drugs. imagine you did all that to sell drugs and then they legalize drugs, and you were like, “but i…” this has been a real thrill to perform here, by the way. i just wanna say that in all sincerity. thanks for coming to this. really, really appreciate it. i wanna tell you one more story before i get out of here, about the night i met a guy named bill clinton. now, i don’t… some of you know who that is? for those of you that don’t, he was president of the united states from 1993 until 2001, and he is a smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declared emperor of the united states of america. now, i know you know who bill clinton is. but i was doing a show at a college, and i mentioned bill clinton, and, like, they kind of didn’t know who he was. like, sorry, they knew the name, right? but they only knew this 2015 bill clinton, who’s a very different bill clinton. have you seen his ass lately? what the hell is he trying to pull? he’s all thin now, and he wears these little tight suits, and he’s got these grandpa reading glasses, like, “hey, i can’t do nothing to nobody no more.” “oh, me? i’m just an old, old man. i don’t have the appetites.” you know? and he’s always flying around the world with bill gates trying to cure aids. that is not the bill clinton that we all signed up for 20 years ago. our bill clinton was like a big, fat buddy garrity from friday night lights-looking guy, who played the saxophone on arsenio, and his work in the std community was not in curing anything at that time. that was the man we all elected president. that was the bill clinton that i met. i got to meet bill clinton when he was governor clinton in 1992, when he was first running for president. and i got to meet bill clinton because my parents had gone to the same college as bill clinton. they’re a little younger, but they went to the same college. so, when he was first running for president, he would have all these big, like, alumni fundraisers, and everyone who went was invited to go. now, this was really cool for a couple reasons. one, i got to meet bill clinton. but two, i got to watch my parents watch someone they went to school with become the president. and that is super funny to see, ’cause think about some of the people you went to school with. now imagine they’re becoming the president. imagine sam was becoming the president. it would stir up strong emotions. and my parents had very different opinions on bill clinton. my mom loved bill clinton, ’cause bill clinton was always a really charismatic, handsome guy. i mean, think about how many women he got in the 1990s when he looked like frank caliendo doing john madden. now… imagine him as a college student. and my mom tells me that there was this sort of chivalrous policy on campus back then, where, late at night, if female students were leaving the library unaccompanied, male students were encouraged to wait out in front and offer to walk them home. that sounds good, right? so, my mom tells me that bill clinton would be out in front of the library every single night… just being like, “hey, can i walk ya home? hey, can i walk ya home? hey, can i walk ya home? hey, can i walk ya home?” and one night, my mom was leaving the library, and bill clinton was like, “hey, can i walk ya home?” and my mom was like, “hell, yes.” so… this is absolutely true. my mom, little ellen stanton, walked arm-in-arm with bill clinton to her dorm. and she was like, “you know, i wanted to invite him up for a beer.” and i was like, “thanks, i’m nine.” but… her roommate was upstairs, so she lost her chance with bill clinton. now, my dad, on the other hand, hated bill clinton, because my parents were dating during this time. and also, my dad’s a much more morally-upright, conservative kind of guy. he always told me that he hated it in college that bill clinton could, quote, “get away with anything.” can you imagine how he felt later? so, one day, this invitation arrives for a fundraiser where you could meet bill clinton. my mom opens it first and she goes, “oh, we have to go. we have to go see bill.” and without looking up at her, my dad just says, “why? it’s not like he’s gonna remember you.” one black coffee. same motherfucker. so, my mom says, “fine! i’ll go and i’ll take john.” and i was like, “hell, yeah.” and i slid in the room in my first communion suit, ready to go. ‘cause i loved bill clinton. i was ten years old. if you were a kid when bill clinton was first released, it was the most exciting thing ever. we’d never seen a cool politician before. and he would go on mtv, and he’d have cool answers to kids’ questions. they’d be like, “governor, what’s your favorite food?” and he’d be like, “i don’t know, fries?” and we’d be like, “yay, we eat fries!” i learned to play his campaign song on the piano. it was “don’t stop” by fleetwood mac… from rumours, an album written by and for people cheating on each other. he let us know who he was right away. so, i went with my mom, as her date… to reconnect with governor bill clinton. we walked into the ballroom. it was a big hotel ballroom. it was the palmer house hilton, big hilton hotel ballroom. walked into the ballroom, it was packed with people. it’s actually the ballroom from the end of the movie the fugitive, remember? so, that ballroom. so, my mom and i walk in, it’s packed with people, the… sorry, the end where harrison ford, as dr. richard kimble, bursts in to confront dr. charles nichols, right? okay. so, that ballroom. so, my mom and i walk in, it’s packed with people. why does kimble confront nichols? well, i know we all know this, but… no, no. but, but, but… kimble, he found out that nichols, along with devlin macgregor and lentz, who has mysteriously died, they had hired frederick sykes, the one-armed man, to kill kimble. kimble’s wife wasn’t even the target. i know we all know this. but they were gonna kill kimble because he wasn’t gonna approve certain liver samples to pass rud-90. so, kimble finds out about all of this, and, of course, he’s furious. and he bursts into the ballroom and he goes, “you switched the samples!” and dr. nichols is like, “ladies and gentlemen, my friend, dr. richard kimble.” what accent did that guy have, by the way? he goes, “you switched the samples! and you doctored your research! so that you could have provasic!” anyway, so it’s that ballroom. so, we walk into that ballroom. it was packed with people. it was packed with people. a real who’s not of chicago celebrities. walter jacobson was there. walter jacobson was the local fox anchor. he’d do fun things where he’d go undercover as a homeless person. and he’d be like, “oh, what time is the soup?” and they’d be like, “man, you’re walter jacobson.” he was there. everybody. and on the far side of the ballroom, under a spotlight, we saw a little bit of silver hair. and it was him… bill clinton. the comeback kid. but he was surrounded by reporters, and photographers, and secret service. so, what are you gonna do? well, if you’re my mom, you ball up the back of my sport coat, and you push me forward like a human shield. and then you start jogging while yelling, “this ten-year-old boy has to meet the next president of the united states!” kind of implying that i might be dying. my feet were not on the ground. she was swinging me like a snowplow. i was just mowing down fat chicago democrats. i pushed past all the reporters, i pushed past all the photographers. we pushed past all the secret service. we land at bill clinton’s feet. bill clinton turns, looks at my mom and says, “hey, ellen,” ’cause he never forgets a bitch, ever. my mom melts. she goes, “hi, bill.” then it is revealed that she has no plan. so… she pushes me towards clinton and she goes, “this is my son, john, and he’s also going to be president.” and i was like, “what the hell are you talking about? i’m not gonna be president.” and i know now that i’m definitely never gonna be president. not unless everyone gets real cool about a bunch of stuff really quickly. based on my ten-year-old memory, bill clinton is about 13 feet tall. and he leaned down, because, well, i was wearing this button that i bought outside the fundraiser. it was a cartoon button of george h. w. bush, and it had a quail flying over his head, and it was shitting on his head. and it said, “bird-brained.” and i thought it was very funny. and bill clinton leaned down so that only i could hear and he said, “hey, man, i like your button.” and i said, “you can do whatever you want forever.” and he took my advice. and… it was the best night of my entire life. and i got home that night… i got home that night, and my dad was still awake, like, reading angry under one lamp, just like… and i went up to him and i went, “hey! i’m gonna be a democrat.” “and i’m gonna vote for bill clinton.” and without looking up at me, my dad just said, “you have the moral backbone of a chocolate éclair.” you know, how you talk to a child. so, here’s the end of that story. that was 1992. let’s flash forward five years to 1997. it is now 1997. i am a sophomore in high school, bill clinton is in his second term as president. and on the morning that the monica lewinsky scandal breaks on the cover of the new york times. it had been on the drudge report, and then it was on the cover of the new york times. that morning, i wake up to the newspaper hitting me in the face. i am a teenager asleep in bed, and the newspaper hits me in the face and falls open on my stomach. and i open my eyes to see my dad standing there dressed for work, and he says, “the other shoe just dropped.” and then my dad went in to work to find out that his law firm had been hired to defend bill clinton. good night, chicago. your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * \n",

            "armed with boyish charm and a sharp wit the former “snl” writer john mulaney offers sly takes on marriage his beef with babies and the time he met bill clinton all right petunia wish me luck out there you will die on august 7th 2037 that’s pretty good all right hello hello chicago nice to see you again thank you that was very nice thank you look now you’re a wonderful crowd but i need you to keep your energy up the entire show okay because… no no no thank you some crowds… some crowds they have big energy in the beginning and then they run out of places to go so… i don’t judge those crowds by the way okay we’ve all gone too big too fast and then run out of room we’ve all made a “happy birthday” sign… wait you get that poster board up and you’re like “i don’t need to trace it i know how big letters should be to begin with a bigass ‘h’ followed by a bigass ‘a’ and… oh no oh god okay all right real skinny ‘p’ with a high hump and then we’ll put the second ‘p’ below the hump of that first ‘p’ sort of like a motorcycle sidecar situation and now i have no room for the ‘y’ so i’ll do a kind of curledup noodle ‘y’ block letters and cursive look good together” and then you go to write “birthday” and you totally forget the lesson you just learned with “happy” you’re like “yeah but the past is the past bigass ‘b’ surely more letters will fit in the same space” you’re very friendly here in chicago i mean we’re all violent here but you’re very friendly no really and i don’t like confrontation ’cause i’ve never been in a fight before though maybe you could tell that from the first moment i walked out on stage i don’t give off that vibe some people give off a vibe of… right away they’re like “do not fuck with me” my vibe is more like “hey you could pour soup in my lap and i’ll probably apologize to you” when i walk for real my feet go out like this i’m so open and vulnerable i look like a doll that you point out molestation on “show us on this white comedian where the man touched you” it’s been a while since i’ve been home to chicago i got married since then thank you i married my wife i love saying “my wife” it sounds so adult “that’s my wife” it’s great you sound like a person i said it even before we were married we were just dating and we were once getting on an airplane and anna’s ticket didn’t say anything and my ticket said “priority access” it doesn’t matter why but we were getting on and i said “uh can my wife board with me” and they were like “yes of course right this way” and i was like “oh that is so much better than all those times i was like ‘can my girlfriend come” and yeah i shouldn’t have said it that way but still “my wife” just has some kickass to it you know “get away from my wife no one talk to my wife” marriage is gonna be very magical “i didn’t kill my wife” that’s like “ooh who’s that fella i bet he did kill his wife” being married is so nice i never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself that’s not really a joke that’s just a little sweet thing i like to say ‘cause i’d been in relationships where i got cheated on like long ones i don’t know if you’ve ever been in a long relationship where you got cheated on but it changes your whole worldview ‘cause when i was a kid i used to watch america’s most wanted you know how kids do and i would always think to myself “how could another person kill someone how could a human being kill another human being” and then i got cheated on and i was like “oh okay” “i’m not gonna do it but i totally get it” and i don’t mean in that way of like “no one else can have you” i don’t care about that it’s just creepy to have an ex out there after things have ended badly they have a lot of information anyone who’s seen my dick and met my parents needs to die i can’t have them roaming around i talked to a lot of people before i got engaged you know and i heard this expression about whether or not you should get married this is an old expression people say this they say “why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free” you ever heard that before it’s a bananas insulting expression… to an entire gender but also it makes no sense “why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free” you’re not allowed to milk a cow that you don’t own that’s not even a situation was that a problem at one point like in the dairy community was that happening a hundred years ago in some village some dutch prick was sneaking in at night being like “ahhaha i take your milk” and the farmer was like “well then this is your cow now” and he was like “no no proof of purchase” and he ran off into the night that sounded dutch right you know what that… you know what that expression means it means “why would you marry a woman if she’s already having sex with you” which has nothing to do with what relationships are even like anymore now it’s like “why buy the cow” uh maybe because every day the cow asks you when you’re gonna buy it and… … you live in a really small apartment with the cow so you can’t avoid that question at all and also the cow is way better at arguing than you are and the cow grew up in a family that knows how to argue “why buy the cow” uh maybe because every time another cow gets bought you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale and your cow looks over at you the entire time like… and does not enjoy the sale at all… even though she’s the one that wanted to go to the sale and she’s especially mad because that farmer and cow met like eight months after you guys met “why buy the cow” well let’s be real here you’re very lucky to have the cow that you do have “roping in cows and getting milk out of them was never anything you were known for john” by the most liberal of estimates there have been about eight cows total several unmilked and… a lot of people think that you like bulls and if you just bought… they assume it when you search your name the third thing to come up is like “john mulaney bull” and if you just bought the cow nobody would say that anymore they’ll still say it ‘cause there are those guys who they buy a cow and then on the side total matador but… but for real chicago why buy the cow let’s be real why buy the cow because you love her you really do and yeah yeah… sure she’s a bossy little jew but… … she takes care of you and you don’t wanna be some old man stumbling around like “hey you seen any loose milk” my wife is jewish she’s a new york jew i did it now i was raised catholic i don’t know if you can tell that from the everything about me my wife is jewish i grew up catholic so we got married by a friend being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families’ religions while confusing the elderly people at the wedding “what’s the name of the bishop” “that’s actually standup comedian dan levy he was the host of mtv’s your face or mine” i saw a lot of catholic weddings though because i was an altar boy… and a hush falls over the room isn’t it weird how that became a scandalous thing that was just some boring shit i had to do on weekends but now it’s like saying “i was a french maid for a period of time i was treated well in my day i worked for a variety of sirs” no being an altar boy was just a boring gig you know you’d serve mass and then you’d serve weddings sometimes my brother was once an altar boy at a wedding and he was standing there with another altar boy in this big packed church in chicago where we grew up and the bride was coming down the aisle and the organ was playing and all the pews were filled and the bride got all the way to the altar and the groom lifted the veil off of the bride and right at that moment the other altar boy said “aw she’s ugly” and then they looked and they were right next to the video camera and i know that’s awful but wouldn’t you give a million dollars to see that wedding video it was the best moment of this stupid woman’s life and she’s walking down the aisle and the organ’s like… and she gets all the way to the altar to her betrothed and he unveils her to the world and to the eyes of god and right at that second for no reason at all some cheetofingered ratmustached 13yearold prick decides to go “aw she’s ugly” hopefully the videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it to be like “aw she’s beautiful she’s enchanting” i grew up catholic i don’t go to church anymore but i went on christmas eve with my parents ’cause you know how you lie to your parents so… we go into the church and i was like “i got this under control” and then i got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit no i was going through mass and i was batting like 400 and then in the middle of mass the priest said “peace be with you” and everyone said “and with your spirit” and i was the one prey2k asshole going “and also with you what huh what huh what when when” for those of you that aren’t catholic i don’t mean to exclude you even though we love to exclude you but… there’s a part in church where the priest says “peace be with you” and for many many years we all said… – “and also with you” – very good but they changed it to “and with your spirit” because that’s what needed revamping in the catholic church that was the squeaky wheel that needed the grease in rome they were like “let’s see what problems can we solve problem one no” i’m actually glad they changed that though i never liked “and also with you” i always found that clunky “and also with you” that’s not how you talk – “have a nice day” – “and also you having one” it’s just a little bit wrong isn’t it it’s just a little off like when someone’s like “how are you” and you’re like “nothing much” and it sort of makes sense never begin a sentence with “and also” you just immediately sound caught offguard it sounds like if at the first church ever like they weren’t expecting it like the priest was like “hey this is the first time we’ve ever had church i just wanna say ‘peace be with you” and they were like… “what oh uh yeah and also you should have some” “hey that’s good let’s keep that for 2000 years and then change it to trick john” my wife and i don’t have any children we have a dog we have a little puppy named petunia she’s a tiny little french bulldog puppy i like having a puppy that’s a bulldog ’cause it’s like having a baby that is also a grandma her body is young her face is as old as time she definitely saw the nazis march into paris she always gives me this look of like “oh the things i have seen you cocksucker you have no idea the gestapo threw my printing press into a river but go tell your fucking jokes bring me my dish” she said that petunia… petunia is my best friend in the world i give her a million kisses a day she does not like me and barks at me and bites me all day long we had to get a dog trainer into the apartment because petunia is a bad dog we tell her that every day we go “hey you’re bad at being a dog” so the trainer came into the apartment sorry didn’t even walk into the apartment walked into the threshold and went “oh okay” like she was an exorcist or something she said “i see what the problem is” she said “petunia has become the alpha of the house” and then she pointed at me she said “you are no longer the alpha of the house” and in the back of my head i was like “i was never the alpha of the house” i turned to my wife i was like “let’s pretend it’ll be fun yes… my title of alpha which i once had how can i reclaim it because that was a thing that existed at one time” she said “you need to show dominance over your puppy” these are things people say to me i said “how do i do that” she said “well let me ask you this who eats dinner first you or petunia” i was like “petunia eats dinner first she eats dinner at 500 pm ’cause she’s a foot long and two years old” she said “no you need to eat dinner first because the king eats before anyone else eats” oh yes and what a mighty king i will be eating dinner at 445 in the afternoon “look upon your sovereign petunia and tremble my lands stretch across this entire one bedroom and i eat dinner whenever i choose as long as it works for the schedule of a dog” she said “now you don’t actually have to eat dinner before petunia you just have to convince petunia that you’ve already eaten” so… for the past month i shit you not… before my wife and i give petunia her dish we take down empty bowls and spoons and in front of her we go “mmm dinner mmm good dinner” like we’re space aliens in a play about human beings that they wrote but they didn’t work that hard on “mmm we’re eating dinner” meanwhile petunia’s just staring at us with her paul giamatti face like… “you’re not eating dinner cocksucker dish now” i have a wife and a dog and we just bought a house we have a new house it was built in the ’20s but it was flipped in 2014 which means it’s haunted but it has a lovely kitchen backsplash actually we didn’t buy a house a bank bought a house and i’m allowed to keep my shirts and pants there while i pay it off for 30 years the woman from the bank came over and she showed me my mortgage broken down month by month for 30 years and she said “so for instance this is what you’ll pay in july of 2029” and i burst out laughing i was like “2029 that’s not a real year by 2029 i’ll be drinking moon juice with president jonathan taylor thomas i’m not gonna be writing you a paper check” i like having a house but i loved looking for a house ’cause i love real estate agents i mean they are the true heroes they really are have you ever watched hgtv real estate agents have to deal with the dumbest people in the world making the biggest decisions of their lives every episode of hgtv is like “craig and stacia are looking for a twostory aframe that’s near craig’s job in the downtown but also satisfies stacia’s need to be near the beach which is nowhere near craig’s job with three children and nine on the way and a max budget of 7… let’s see what lori jo can do on this week’s episode of you don’t deserve a beach house” i loved our real estate agent it was so fun to hang out with her it was like hanging out with my mom ‘cause you know real estate agents always look like your mom and they have various chico’s accoutrements they always have kind of fun mom energy and they’re always “so excited to see you two” we would have little conferences before we walked into a house she’d go “let’s talk let’s talk before we go in” we’re like two feet from the door “so there’s no toilets and i know that was on your list but i think i can get him to budge let’s go” so we’d have a real estate agent and then like the house would have a real estate agent who’s just some guy sitting in a big chair and these two always hated each other they’d be like “hi tony” “hi kim” it’s like “jesus christ what were you two in the eagles together what is the animosity about” our real estate agent wanted us to have a baby more than anyone else in our lives more than anyone in our family she hinted about it constantly every room she walked into she’d be like “so this could be an office” “or maybe a nursery” “yeah no like we said we don’t know if we’re gonna have… ” “no no i know i know you know you don’t know if you’re gonna have ’em but you know you know you never know sometimes you don’t know what’s gonna happen and then… you know something happens” “well yeah that’s how all of life works” “okay all right okay uhhuh mmm this is an onfire garbage can could be a nursery” she showed me a backyard once she goes “i don’t even like this backyard for you” i was like “oh do tell” she said “it’s all pavement i think you should have some grass out there you know in case you have a couple… little guys… running around in the grass” and i got offended on behalf of my imaginary kids i was like “hey lady i went outside about as much as powder from the movie powder my children are not gonna be playing out on grass they will be up in their rooms playing violent video games and catfishing pedophiles these are my children and that’s my wife” i didn’t mean to make it sound like we don’t want children we don’t but i didn’t mean to make it sound like that see i just don’t think babies like me very much sometimes babies will point at me and i don’t care for that shit at all like i’ll be on an elevator and a baby will be there in its big like stroller activity tray just like working on one cheerio with bobby fischerlike intensity and it’ll look up at me and go… i like to lean in and go “stop snitchin’ motherfucker” and then walk off ‘cause you’re never too young to learn our national nosnitching policy my friends have babies and i don’t do so well with them i had a runin with a twoyearold girl i know there are better ways to start that story but… my friend jeremy has this twoyearold girl and i really like her she’s a sweet kid i really like his daughter a lot but i was over at his family’s house for the fourth of july and he had his daughter on his knee and it was a very lovely day his whole extended family was there and he was bouncing his twoyearold up and down and he pointed at me and he said to his twoyearold “do you know who that is that’s your uncle john” and i was like “oh my god that’s so sweet i’m her uncle john” and then the baby pointed at me and said “uncle john has a penis” i thank you for laughing because no one did that day fell deadly silent is what they all did hey do you know what you’re supposed to say when a baby points at you and knowingly says “he has a penis” no i’m asking ’cause i don’t know what to say in that situation here’s what i went with that day i said “oh come on” i don’t know i thought that’d be good but then it just made it worse ’cause it sounded like the baby and i had an arrangement not to talk about it and she had violated my trust like the baby had been like “do you have a penis” and i was like “yes i do but you’re a baby so discretion is key” and then the next day she goes “he has a penis” and i go “oh come on someone can’t keep a secret” luckily jeremy’s wife saved the day the baby’s mom saved the day she came in and she picked up the baby and she was like “it’s okay she’s just going through that phase where she says penis and vagina a lot” aren’t we all and by the way it would’ve been a totally different situation if the baby had said vagina like if a grown woman had walked in the room and the baby had been like “she has a vagina” the woman could be like “yes i do and it’s magnificent” and we would all be like “hooray you are brave” no one wants to applaud the penis of a 32yearold weirdo it’s fun to be married i’ve never been supervised before i’m supervised she studies what i do like an anthropologist she’ll be like “sometimes he will watch a movie on tv even though he already owns that movie on dvd pointing this out to him confuses and upsets him” i had no supervision when i was a kid we were free to do what we wanted but also with that no one cared about kids i grew up before children were special i did very early ’80s right before children became special like i remember when milk carton kids became a thing when they were like “hey we should start looking for some of these guys i don’t think they’re just blowing off steam” no one cared about my opinion when i was a little kid no one cared what i thought sometimes people would say “what do you think you’re doing” but that just meant “stop” they didn’t actually wanna know my thought process they didn’t want me to be like “well i was gonna put this bottle rocket into this carton of eggs so that when i lit off the bottle rocket the eggs would explode everywhere” “oh well that’s very interesting and what brought you to this experiment” “oh well thank you for asking well… you know how i’m filled with rage i’m so horny and angry all the time… and i have no outlet for it so… eggs” your opinion doesn’t matter in elementary school either it matters in college college is just your opinion just you raising your hand and being like “i think emily dickinson’s a lesbian” and they’re like “partial credit” and that’s a whole thing but in elementary school it doesn’t matter what you think it just matters what you know you have to have answers to questions and if you say “i don’t know” you get an x on your test and you get it wrong and that’s not fair ’cause your brain has never been smaller also that’s not how life works i’m in my 30s now if you came to me now and you were like “hey john name three things that the stamp act of 1775 accomplished” i’d go “i don’t know get out of my apartment” you know but when you’re a little kid you can’t say “i don’t know” you should be able to that should be an acceptable answer on a test you should be able to write in “i don’t know i know you told me but i have had a very long day i am very small and i have no money so you can imagine the kind of stress that i am under” or if it’s one of those true or false questions you should be able to add a third option which is “who’s to say” kids are much more supervised now but also they have a lot of rights like that’s the biggest civil rights increase i’ve seen in my lifetime the rights of children have gone through the roof i had no rights when i was a little kid i remember one time i walked into a supermarket by myself and i walked in through the double doors and the woman behind the register just looked at me and she went “no” and i went “all right” and i turned around and left that’s how broken i was and there weren’t special things for kids the way there are now like we would just go see movies any movie like back to the future that was a movie everyone could see kids could kinda see it great movie right i rewatched it recently it’s a very weird movie marty mcfly is a 17yearold high school student whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist and i shit you not they never explain how they became friends they never explain it not even in a lazy way like “hey remember when we met in the science building” they don’t even do that and we were all fine with it we were just like “what who’s his best friend a disgraced nuclear physicist all right proceed” what a strange movie to sell to be a family movie two guys had to go in and do that they had to be like “okay… we got an idea… for the next big familyactioncomedy all right it’s about a guy named marty and he’s very lazy he’s always sleeping late” “okay is he cool like ferris bueller” “no but he does have this best friend who’s you know a disgraced… nuclear physicist” “i’m confused here this best friend this is another student” “no no no no this guy’s either like 40 or 80 even we don’t know how old this guy’s supposed to be but one day the boy and the scientist they go back in time and they build a time machine whoa” “okay i think i see where you’re going here they build a time machine and they go back in time and they stop the kennedy assassination” “ah oh wow that’s a really good idea i mean we didn’t even think of that” “all right well what do they do with the time machine” “well now i’m embarrassed to say ah well all right all right all right we thought… we thought it would be funny you know if the boy if he went back in time and you know he tried to fuck his mom” “i don’t know we thought that’d be fun for people but no good point no he doesn’t get to he doesn’t get to ‘cause this family friend named biff he comes in and he tries to rape the mom in front of the son the dad’s gotta beat the rapist off of her and also we’re gonna imply that a white man wrote ‘johnny b goode’ so we’re gonna take that away from ’em” “well this is the best movie idea i have ever heard in my life we’re gonna make three of them now you say they go to the past how about we call it back to the past” “no no no back to the future” “right but they go to the past” “yeah” kids have it very good now my friend’s a teacher she told me that uh… the parents will take the kids’ side over the teacher now that’s insane that never happened my parents trusted every grownup… more than they trusted me i don’t mean coaches and teachers any human adult’s word… was better than mine any hobo or drifter could have taken me by the ear up to my front door and been like “excuse me your kid bit my dick” and my mom would be like “john edmund mulaney did you bite this nice man’s dick” and i would be the only one who’s like “hey doesn’t anyone wanna know why… his dick was near my biters… in the first place isn’t anyone curious… as to how i had access” don’t get me wrong my parents love us they just didn’t like us we weren’t friends people are now like “my mom’s my best friend” i was like “oh is she a super bad mom” my parents didn’t trust us and they shouldn’t have trusted us we were little goblins we were terrible i remember one time we were going to this resort for a vacation when we were little kids three weeks before we went to the resort my dad sat us down and he said “all right we’re going to a resort and i’ve just been informed that the man who owns the resort only has one arm” and we were like “oh yes yay yes” “now i’m telling you three weeks in advance so that you will not freak out when you see that he only has one arm” “oh we’re gonna freak out so bad” “yes john you have a question” “how did he lose his arm” “that’s exactly what you won’t ask” and then i did ask i went into the kitchen one day and i was like “so how’d you lose your arm” and he was like “well i was born with only one arm” and i was like “nah” no my parents loved us it’s just like they were the cops you know and we were criminals so we didn’t get along we only got along in that way that like cops will sometimes be chummy with criminals like when my dad and i would talk it was like that scene in the movie heat when robert de niro and al pacino sit down in that diner we kind of had that rapport of like “hmm we’re not so different you and i you have your law practice and me i have all these fucking markers” “i guess we both have responsibilities when you look at it that way” my dad would respect it if i could get away with breaking a rule we had a rule in our house you were not allowed to watch tv on a school night so every school night i would 100 be watching tv and i would hear my dad coming i would immediately turn the tv off and grab any book magazine periodical anything and i’d open it and pretend to be doing homework my dad would walk in the room and he would go “what are you doing are you watching tv” and i’d go “no man i’m not watching tv” and the tv wouldn’t even be dark yet it would still have like a neon green halo around it it’d be sizzling like a glass of pepsi and i would look my dad in the eyes and go “no i’m just reading this yellow pages” my dad loved us he just didn’t care about our general happiness or selfesteem i remember one time we were really little kids i have two sisters and a brother and all four of us were in our family car ride for three hours going to wisconsin my dad was driving going down the highway in our white van with wood around the side ‘cause you remember when you wanted your car to be made of wood you remember that era where we were like “how much wood can we get on this car… without it catching on fire” but then the big announcement “we here at plymouthchrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood safely on the outside of your car for all those times you’ve looked at your minivan and thought ‘huh it needs a belt” so we’re going on the highway we’ve been on the road for three hours and in the distance we see a mcdonald’s we see the golden arches and we got so excited we started chanting “mcdonald’s mcdonald’s mcdonald’s mcdonald’s” and my dad pulled into the drivethru and we started cheering and then he ordered one black coffee for himself and kept driving and you know as mad as that made me as a little kid in retrospect that is the funniest thing i have ever seen in my entire life how perfect is that he had a vanload of little kids and he got black coffee the one thing from mcdonald’s no child could enjoy my dad is coldblooded he once shushed a kid during lion king on broadway that actually happened we were at lion king on broadway and there was a fiveyearold behind us going “look it’s pumbaa look it’s timon” and my dad turned around and said “are you going to talk the entire time” he’s my hero the weirdest thing when i was a kid was how much they scared us about smoking weed they scared us about it constantly and i’ve been on tour this year… marijuana is legal in 18 or 19 states in some form or another it’s insane yeah well… all right don’t “whoo” if you’re white it’s always been legal for us come on sir we don’t go to jail for marijuana you silly billy when i was arrested with a onehitter at a rusted root concert i did not serve hard time i think i got an award eighteen or 19 states and by the way i agree it’s a very good thing but it’s also a really weird thing because this is the first time i’ve ever seen a law change because the government is just like “fine” you know i’ve never seen it before like gay marriage and healthcare we have to battle it out in the supreme court and be like “gay people are humans” and they’re like “we’ll think about it” but with weed it was just something we wanted really badly and we kept asking them for 40 years like “excuse me” and then suddenly the government became like cool parents and they’re just like “okay here take a little we’d rather you do it in the house than go somewhere else… blah blah blah blah blah” those stupid parents and that’s a big deal because they scared us about weed constantly it would be on our sitcoms we’d be watching saved by the bell we’d be having a great old time and then suddenly a character we had not seen before would show up with some weed and the episode would stop cold in its tracks and they’d always hold the joint… the bad guy would hold the joint in a villainous way they’d always offer the joint in a way that no one ever holds a joint like it’s a skull in a shakespeare play and now it’s legal and that is great news unless you’re a weed dealer and then it is terrible news and i don’t just mean because they’re about to lose out to amazoncom i more feel bad for weed dealers ’cause they’re about to find out that we only showed them a certain amount of politeness because they had an illegal product and we don’t show that same politeness to people who deliver legal products like when the chinese food delivery guy comes we don’t let him hang out after he’s delivered the chinese food and we don’t look the other way when he says weird shit to the girls we’re hanging out with… to try to preserve the relationship and we definitely don’t give him some of the chinese food he’s never like “hey can i get in on those dumplings” and we’re like “yeah we’re all friends” what are you on your phone hey vneck hey – what’s your name – sam sam cool what do you do to afford vnecks sam typing numbers ah… numbers the letters of math i’m sorry to bother you i don’t mean to single you out i hate when people get pulled out of the audience like are you familiar with the cirque du soleil sam they’re a group of french assholes that are slowly taking over america by humiliating audience members one by one we once went to see cirque du soleil at navy pier when i was a kid and my brother came and he was 12 years old you remember being 12 when you’re like “no one look at me or i’ll kill myself” and these french bastards come into the crowd being like “le volunteer” and they pulled my brother up on stage and i was like “no” and they brought him up and they reached into his sweatshirt and they were like… and they had planted a bra and they pulled out a bra and they were like… and everyone at navy pier was like “ah ha ha ha ha” and my brother was like “that’s great” i have had other jobs besides comedy i was an office temp for a while i really miss that i loved being a temp because i would just go from office to office and be terrible at a different job for a week and then you just get to retire like lou gehrig you’re like “thank you no one will ever see me again” and they’re like “goodbye” i worked at an office once on 57th street in new york city i was there for a couple weeks i was in a cubicle next to this other cubicle this woman named mischa sat in the other cubicle i want to get the number right i think mischa had… about 900000 photos of her daughter up in her cubicle almost like she was trying to solve a conspiracy about her daughter a beautiful mindstyle i think about mischa two times a week… because of a phone call she had next to me one day it was one of my first days and i was sitting next to her and her phone rang and this was her call and i’m quoting her phone rang and she said “hello hush” and then she hung up think about that two times a week and i didn’t know her well enough by then to be like “hey what kind of a person are you” you know who could she have been talking to “hello hush” this was a place of business my only thought was that it was the ceo of the company being like “mischa help i’m doing a crossword puzzle i need a fourletter word for ‘be quiet’ right now” – “hush” – “you’re promoted” i temped at a little web company on 25th street in new york city it was a small web company owned by this old man who was old old old money new york his name was henry j finch iv like old old old money like his money was in molasses or something he owned this web company i have no idea why he owned this web company i think he won it in a rich man’s game of dice and small binoculars or something mr finch wore linen suits he had suspenders he had a bow tie he had a hat he had a cane with an ivory handle i’m giving you more description than you need ’cause i need you to believe me this was a real person i knew in the 21st century mr finch was in his 70s he had an assistant named mary she was in her 50s she was korean i don’t know why he had an assistant he did not need one unless he needed someone to be like “remember mr finch at five o’clock you need to keep looking like a hardboiled egg” one day mr finch came into the office it had been raining everything i’m about to say to you was said in front of me on that afternoon mr finch walked into the office and he was wearing a raincoat he was wearing a rain hat and he had his cane and he walked in and he said and i’m quoting “ah one feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet and when one feels like a duck one is happy” and then mary yelled “ooh ducklings” to which mr finch replied “too old to be a duckling quack quack” and then walked into his office i think about that every goddamn day i mean imagine you’re me you’re a 22yearold temp and you’re so hungover and you just wanna die every day and then that happens in front of you and i don’t know gives you hope and i did that a little fast let me break that conversation down for you mr finch walked in and he began a conversation the way anyone would “ah” “one feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet” the rain “and when one feels like a duck one is happy” now that’s debatable but rather than debate that point mary brought up a new separate but interesting point… which was “ducklings” but mr finch ever the realist about his own age and mortality… said “ah too old to be a duckling” as if to say “my duckling days are behind me mary don’t you see i’m a duck now and to prove it… well i’ll say just about the most famous catchphrase a duck has… ‘quack quack” and i knew right at that moment by the way that it meant nothing to mr finch what he had said crazy people are like that they have unlimited crazy currency like if i had gone into his office a couple weeks later and been like “hey finch you remember that time you were like ‘too old to be a duckling quack quack’” he would just be like “ah perhaps i did quack but such is life for an old knickerbocker like me” like he’d say something else crazy that’s the wonderful thing about crazy people you know is that they just have unlimited currency the things they say mean nothing to them but they mean everything to me i was once walking into penn station in new york i was walking down 31st street towards eighth avenue i’m walking down 31st there’s this woman standing at eighth and 31st i have my little roller suitcase you can all imagine i’m walking towards her she’s smoking a cigarette that is not lit anymore she’s watching me walk kind of scanning me up and down as if she had terminator vision… where she could see little bits of data like “little honky ass” and could read information as i walked past her she said this to me i walked past her and she said and i’m quoting “eat ass suck a dick and sell drugs” very dirty yes a very upsetting thing to hear yes i’m sorry you all had to hear that but at least you all got to hear it as a group i was alone out there that afternoon and she said this totally unprompted “eat ass suck a dick and sell drugs” it wasn’t like i had paused in front of her and been like “what should i do with my life” so i walk away from her with this todo list and i like structure i like a todo list it did dawn on me that that list of things does get better as it goes along when you really think about it ‘cause it starts in a pretty rough place it starts with just about the worst task a todo list can start with but by the end you have your own small business and isn’t that the american dream when all’s said and done that if you eat enough ass and suck enough dick one day you can sell drugs imagine you did all that to sell drugs and then they legalize drugs and you were like “but i…” this has been a real thrill to perform here by the way i just wanna say that in all sincerity thanks for coming to this really really appreciate it i wanna tell you one more story before i get out of here about the night i met a guy named bill clinton now i don’t… some of you know who that is for those of you that don’t he was president of the united states from 1993 until 2001 and he is a smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declared emperor of the united states of america now i know you know who bill clinton is but i was doing a show at a college and i mentioned bill clinton and like they kind of didn’t know who he was like sorry they knew the name right but they only knew this 2015 bill clinton who’s a very different bill clinton have you seen his ass lately what the hell is he trying to pull he’s all thin now and he wears these little tight suits and he’s got these grandpa reading glasses like “hey i can’t do nothing to nobody no more” “oh me i’m just an old old man i don’t have the appetites” you know and he’s always flying around the world with bill gates trying to cure aids that is not the bill clinton that we all signed up for 20 years ago our bill clinton was like a big fat buddy garrity from friday night lightslooking guy who played the saxophone on arsenio and his work in the std community was not in curing anything at that time that was the man we all elected president that was the bill clinton that i met i got to meet bill clinton when he was governor clinton in 1992 when he was first running for president and i got to meet bill clinton because my parents had gone to the same college as bill clinton they’re a little younger but they went to the same college so when he was first running for president he would have all these big like alumni fundraisers and everyone who went was invited to go now this was really cool for a couple reasons one i got to meet bill clinton but two i got to watch my parents watch someone they went to school with become the president and that is super funny to see ’cause think about some of the people you went to school with now imagine they’re becoming the president imagine sam was becoming the president it would stir up strong emotions and my parents had very different opinions on bill clinton my mom loved bill clinton ’cause bill clinton was always a really charismatic handsome guy i mean think about how many women he got in the 1990s when he looked like frank caliendo doing john madden now… imagine him as a college student and my mom tells me that there was this sort of chivalrous policy on campus back then where late at night if female students were leaving the library unaccompanied male students were encouraged to wait out in front and offer to walk them home that sounds good right so my mom tells me that bill clinton would be out in front of the library every single night… just being like “hey can i walk ya home hey can i walk ya home hey can i walk ya home hey can i walk ya home” and one night my mom was leaving the library and bill clinton was like “hey can i walk ya home” and my mom was like “hell yes” so… this is absolutely true my mom little ellen stanton walked arminarm with bill clinton to her dorm and she was like “you know i wanted to invite him up for a beer” and i was like “thanks i’m nine” but… her roommate was upstairs so she lost her chance with bill clinton now my dad on the other hand hated bill clinton because my parents were dating during this time and also my dad’s a much more morallyupright conservative kind of guy he always told me that he hated it in college that bill clinton could quote “get away with anything” can you imagine how he felt later so one day this invitation arrives for a fundraiser where you could meet bill clinton my mom opens it first and she goes “oh we have to go we have to go see bill” and without looking up at her my dad just says “why it’s not like he’s gonna remember you” one black coffee same motherfucker so my mom says “fine i’ll go and i’ll take john” and i was like “hell yeah” and i slid in the room in my first communion suit ready to go ‘cause i loved bill clinton i was ten years old if you were a kid when bill clinton was first released it was the most exciting thing ever we’d never seen a cool politician before and he would go on mtv and he’d have cool answers to kids’ questions they’d be like “governor what’s your favorite food” and he’d be like “i don’t know fries” and we’d be like “yay we eat fries” i learned to play his campaign song on the piano it was “don’t stop” by fleetwood mac… from rumours an album written by and for people cheating on each other he let us know who he was right away so i went with my mom as her date… to reconnect with governor bill clinton we walked into the ballroom it was a big hotel ballroom it was the palmer house hilton big hilton hotel ballroom walked into the ballroom it was packed with people it’s actually the ballroom from the end of the movie the fugitive remember so that ballroom so my mom and i walk in it’s packed with people the… sorry the end where harrison ford as dr richard kimble bursts in to confront dr charles nichols right okay so that ballroom so my mom and i walk in it’s packed with people why does kimble confront nichols well i know we all know this but… no no but but but… kimble he found out that nichols along with devlin macgregor and lentz who has mysteriously died they had hired frederick sykes the onearmed man to kill kimble kimble’s wife wasn’t even the target i know we all know this but they were gonna kill kimble because he wasn’t gonna approve certain liver samples to pass rud90 so kimble finds out about all of this and of course he’s furious and he bursts into the ballroom and he goes “you switched the samples” and dr nichols is like “ladies and gentlemen my friend dr richard kimble” what accent did that guy have by the way he goes “you switched the samples and you doctored your research so that you could have provasic” anyway so it’s that ballroom so we walk into that ballroom it was packed with people it was packed with people a real who’s not of chicago celebrities walter jacobson was there walter jacobson was the local fox anchor he’d do fun things where he’d go undercover as a homeless person and he’d be like “oh what time is the soup” and they’d be like “man you’re walter jacobson” he was there everybody and on the far side of the ballroom under a spotlight we saw a little bit of silver hair and it was him… bill clinton the comeback kid but he was surrounded by reporters and photographers and secret service so what are you gonna do well if you’re my mom you ball up the back of my sport coat and you push me forward like a human shield and then you start jogging while yelling “this tenyearold boy has to meet the next president of the united states” kind of implying that i might be dying my feet were not on the ground she was swinging me like a snowplow i was just mowing down fat chicago democrats i pushed past all the reporters i pushed past all the photographers we pushed past all the secret service we land at bill clinton’s feet bill clinton turns looks at my mom and says “hey ellen” ’cause he never forgets a bitch ever my mom melts she goes “hi bill” then it is revealed that she has no plan so… she pushes me towards clinton and she goes “this is my son john and he’s also going to be president” and i was like “what the hell are you talking about i’m not gonna be president” and i know now that i’m definitely never gonna be president not unless everyone gets real cool about a bunch of stuff really quickly based on my tenyearold memory bill clinton is about 13 feet tall and he leaned down because well i was wearing this button that i bought outside the fundraiser it was a cartoon button of george h w bush and it had a quail flying over his head and it was shitting on his head and it said “birdbrained” and i thought it was very funny and bill clinton leaned down so that only i could hear and he said “hey man i like your button” and i said “you can do whatever you want forever” and he took my advice and… it was the best night of my entire life and i got home that night… i got home that night and my dad was still awake like reading angry under one lamp just like… and i went up to him and i went “hey i’m gonna be a democrat” “and i’m gonna vote for bill clinton” and without looking up at me my dad just said “you have the moral backbone of a chocolate éclair” you know how you talk to a child so here’s the end of that story that was 1992 let’s flash forward five years to 1997 it is now 1997 i am a sophomore in high school bill clinton is in his second term as president and on the morning that the monica lewinsky scandal breaks on the cover of the new york times it had been on the drudge report and then it was on the cover of the new york times that morning i wake up to the newspaper hitting me in the face i am a teenager asleep in bed and the newspaper hits me in the face and falls open on my stomach and i open my eyes to see my dad standing there dressed for work and he says “the other shoe just dropped” and then my dad went in to work to find out that his law firm had been hired to defend bill clinton good night chicago your email address

            "armed with boyish charm and a sharp wit the former “snl” writer john mulaney offers sly takes on marriage his beef with babies and the time he met bill clinton all right petunia wish me luck out there you will die on august   that’s pretty good all right hello hello chicago nice to see you again thank you that was very nice thank you look now you’re a wonderful crowd but i need you to keep your energy up the entire show okay because… no no no thank you some crowds… some crowds they have big energy in the beginning and then they run out of places to go so… i don’t judge those crowds by the way okay we’ve all gone too big too fast and then run out of room we’ve all made a “happy birthday” sign… wait you get that poster board up and you’re like “i don’t need to trace it i know how big letters should be to begin with a bigass ‘h’ followed by a bigass ‘a’ and… oh no oh god okay all right real skinny ‘p’ with a high hump and then we’ll put the second ‘p’ below the hump of that first ‘p’ sort of like a motorcycle sidecar situation and now i have no room for the ‘y’ so i’ll do a kind of curledup noodle ‘y’ block letters and cursive look good together” and then you go to write “birthday” and you totally forget the lesson you just learned with “happy” you’re like “yeah but the past is the past bigass ‘b’ surely more letters will fit in the same space” you’re very friendly here in chicago i mean we’re all violent here but you’re very friendly no really and i don’t like confrontation ’cause i’ve never been in a fight before though maybe you could tell that from the first moment i walked out on stage i don’t give off that vibe some people give off a vibe of… right away they’re like “do not fuck with me” my vibe is more like “hey you could pour soup in my lap and i’ll probably apologize to you” when i walk for real my feet go out like this i’m so open and vulnerable i look like a doll that you point out molestation on “show us on this white comedian where the man touched you” it’s been a while since i’ve been home to chicago i got married since then thank you i married my wife i love saying “my wife” it sounds so adult “that’s my wife” it’s great you sound like a person i said it even before we were married we were just dating and we were once getting on an airplane and anna’s ticket didn’t say anything and my ticket said “priority access” it doesn’t matter why but we were getting on and i said “uh can my wife board with me” and they were like “yes of course right this way” and i was like “oh that is so much better than all those times i was like ‘can my girlfriend come” and yeah i shouldn’t have said it that way but still “my wife” just has some kickass to it you know “get away from my wife no one talk to my wife” marriage is gonna be very magical “i didn’t kill my wife” that’s like “ooh who’s that fella i bet he did kill his wife” being married is so nice i never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself that’s not really a joke that’s just a little sweet thing i like to say ‘cause i’d been in relationships where i got cheated on like long ones i don’t know if you’ve ever been in a long relationship where you got cheated on but it changes your whole worldview ‘cause when i was a kid i used to watch america’s most wanted you know how kids do and i would always think to myself “how could another person kill someone how could a human being kill another human being” and then i got cheated on and i was like “oh okay” “i’m not gonna do it but i totally get it” and i don’t mean in that way of like “no one else can have you” i don’t care about that it’s just creepy to have an ex out there after things have ended badly they have a lot of information anyone who’s seen my dick and met my parents needs to die i can’t have them roaming around i talked to a lot of people before i got engaged you know and i heard this expression about whether or not you should get married this is an old expression people say this they say “why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free” you ever heard that before it’s a bananas insulting expression… to an entire gender but also it makes no sense “why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free” you’re not allowed to milk a cow that you don’t own that’s not even a situation was that a problem at one point like in the dairy community was that happening a hundred years ago in some village some dutch prick was sneaking in at night being like “ahhaha i take your milk” and the farmer was like “well then this is your cow now” and he was like “no no proof of purchase” and he ran off into the night that sounded dutch right you know what that… you know what that expression means it means “why would you marry a woman if she’s already having sex with you” which has nothing to do with what relationships are even like anymore now it’s like “why buy the cow” uh maybe because every day the cow asks you when you’re gonna buy it and… … you live in a really small apartment with the cow so you can’t avoid that question at all and also the cow is way better at arguing than you are and the cow grew up in a family that knows how to argue “why buy the cow” uh maybe because every time another cow gets bought you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale and your cow looks over at you the entire time like… and does not enjoy the sale at all… even though she’s the one that wanted to go to the sale and she’s especially mad because that farmer and cow met like eight months after you guys met “why buy the cow” well let’s be real here you’re very lucky to have the cow that you do have “roping in cows and getting milk out of them was never anything you were known for john” by the most liberal of estimates there have been about eight cows total several unmilked and… a lot of people think that you like bulls and if you just bought… they assume it when you search your name the third thing to come up is like “john mulaney bull” and if you just bought the cow nobody would say that anymore they’ll still say it ‘cause there are those guys who they buy a cow and then on the side total matador but… but for real chicago why buy the cow let’s be real why buy the cow because you love her you really do and yeah yeah… sure she’s a bossy little jew but… … she takes care of you and you don’t wanna be some old man stumbling around like “hey you seen any loose milk” my wife is jewish she’s a new york jew i did it now i was raised catholic i don’t know if you can tell that from the everything about me my wife is jewish i grew up catholic so we got married by a friend being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families’ religions while confusing the elderly people at the wedding “what’s the name of the bishop” “that’s actually standup comedian dan levy he was the host of mtv’s your face or mine” i saw a lot of catholic weddings though because i was an altar boy… and a hush falls over the room isn’t it weird how that became a scandalous thing that was just some boring shit i had to do on weekends but now it’s like saying “i was a french maid for a period of time i was treated well in my day i worked for a variety of sirs” no being an altar boy was just a boring gig you know you’d serve mass and then you’d serve weddings sometimes my brother was once an altar boy at a wedding and he was standing there with another altar boy in this big packed church in chicago where we grew up and the bride was coming down the aisle and the organ was playing and all the pews were filled and the bride got all the way to the altar and the groom lifted the veil off of the bride and right at that moment the other altar boy said “aw she’s ugly” and then they looked and they were right next to the video camera and i know that’s awful but wouldn’t you give a million dollars to see that wedding video it was the best moment of this stupid woman’s life and she’s walking down the aisle and the organ’s like… and she gets all the way to the altar to her betrothed and he unveils her to the world and to the eyes of god and right at that second for no reason at all some cheetofingered ratmustached  prick decides to go “aw she’s ugly” hopefully the videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it to be like “aw she’s beautiful she’s enchanting” i grew up catholic i don’t go to church anymore but i went on christmas eve with my parents ’cause you know how you lie to your parents so… we go into the church and i was like “i got this under control” and then i got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit no i was going through mass and i was batting like  and then in the middle of mass the priest said “peace be with you” and everyone said “and with your spirit” and i was the one  asshole going “and also with you what huh what huh what when when” for those of you that aren’t catholic i don’t mean to exclude you even though we love to exclude you but… there’s a part in church where the priest says “peace be with you” and for many many years we all said… – “and also with you” – very good but they changed it to “and with your spirit” because that’s what needed revamping in the catholic church that was the squeaky wheel that needed the grease in rome they were like “let’s see what problems can we solve problem one no” i’m actually glad they changed that though i never liked “and also with you” i always found that clunky “and also with you” that’s not how you talk – “have a nice day” – “and also you having one” it’s just a little bit wrong isn’t it it’s just a little off like when someone’s like “how are you” and you’re like “nothing much” and it sort of makes sense never begin a sentence with “and also” you just immediately sound caught offguard it sounds like if at the first church ever like they weren’t expecting it like the priest was like “hey this is the first time we’ve ever had church i just wanna say ‘peace be with you” and they were like… “what oh uh yeah and also you should have some” “hey that’s good let’s keep that for  years and then change it to trick john” my wife and i don’t have any children we have a dog we have a little puppy named petunia she’s a tiny little french bulldog puppy i like having a puppy that’s a bulldog ’cause it’s like having a baby that is also a grandma her body is young her face is as old as time she definitely saw the nazis march into paris she always gives me this look of like “oh the things i have seen you cocksucker you have no idea the gestapo threw my printing press into a river but go tell your fucking jokes bring me my dish” she said that petunia… petunia is my best friend in the world i give her a million kisses a day she does not like me and barks at me and bites me all day long we had to get a dog trainer into the apartment because petunia is a bad dog we tell her that every day we go “hey you’re bad at being a dog” so the trainer came into the apartment sorry didn’t even walk into the apartment walked into the threshold and went “oh okay” like she was an exorcist or something she said “i see what the problem is” she said “petunia has become the alpha of the house” and then she pointed at me she said “you are no longer the alpha of the house” and in the back of my head i was like “i was never the alpha of the house” i turned to my wife i was like “let’s pretend it’ll be fun yes… my title of alpha which i once had how can i reclaim it because that was a thing that existed at one time” she said “you need to show dominance over your puppy” these are things people say to me i said “how do i do that” she said “well let me ask you this who eats dinner first you or petunia” i was like “petunia eats dinner first she eats dinner at  pm ’cause she’s a foot long and two years old” she said “no you need to eat dinner first because the king eats before anyone else eats” oh yes and what a mighty king i will be eating dinner at  in the afternoon “look upon your sovereign petunia and tremble my lands stretch across this entire one bedroom and i eat dinner whenever i choose as long as it works for the schedule of a dog” she said “now you don’t actually have to eat dinner before petunia you just have to convince petunia that you’ve already eaten” so… for the past month i shit you not… before my wife and i give petunia her dish we take down empty bowls and spoons and in front of her we go “mmm dinner mmm good dinner” like we’re space aliens in a play about human beings that they wrote but they didn’t work that hard on “mmm we’re eating dinner” meanwhile petunia’s just staring at us with her paul giamatti face like… “you’re not eating dinner cocksucker dish now” i have a wife and a dog and we just bought a house we have a new house it was built in the ’ but it was flipped in  which means it’s haunted but it has a lovely kitchen backsplash actually we didn’t buy a house a bank bought a house and i’m allowed to keep my shirts and pants there while i pay it off for  years the woman from the bank came over and she showed me my mortgage broken down month by month for  years and she said “so for instance this is what you’ll pay in july of ” and i burst out laughing i was like “ that’s not a real year by  i’ll be drinking moon juice with president jonathan taylor thomas i’m not gonna be writing you a paper check” i like having a house but i loved looking for a house ’cause i love real estate agents i mean they are the true heroes they really are have you ever watched hgtv real estate agents have to deal with the dumbest people in the world making the biggest decisions of their lives every episode of hgtv is like “craig and stacia are looking for a twostory aframe that’s near craig’s job in the downtown but also satisfies stacia’s need to be near the beach which is nowhere near craig’s job with three children and nine on the way and a max budget of … let’s see what lori jo can do on this week’s episode of you don’t deserve a beach house” i loved our real estate agent it was so fun to hang out with her it was like hanging out with my mom ‘cause you know real estate agents always look like your mom and they have various chico’s accoutrements they always have kind of fun mom energy and they’re always “so excited to see you two” we would have little conferences before we walked into a house she’d go “let’s talk let’s talk before we go in” we’re like two feet from the door “so there’s no toilets and i know that was on your list but i think i can get him to budge let’s go” so we’d have a real estate agent and then like the house would have a real estate agent who’s just some guy sitting in a big chair and these two always hated each other they’d be like “hi tony” “hi kim” it’s like “jesus christ what were you two in the eagles together what is the animosity about” our real estate agent wanted us to have a baby more than anyone else in our lives more than anyone in our family she hinted about it constantly every room she walked into she’d be like “so this could be an office” “or maybe a nursery” “yeah no like we said we don’t know if we’re gonna have… ” “no no i know i know you know you don’t know if you’re gonna have ’em but you know you know you never know sometimes you don’t know what’s gonna happen and then… you know something happens” “well yeah that’s how all of life works” “okay all right okay uhhuh mmm this is an onfire garbage can could be a nursery” she showed me a backyard once she goes “i don’t even like this backyard for you” i was like “oh do tell” she said “it’s all pavement i think you should have some grass out there you know in case you have a couple… little guys… running around in the grass” and i got offended on behalf of my imaginary kids i was like “hey lady i went outside about as much as powder from the movie powder my children are not gonna be playing out on grass they will be up in their rooms playing violent video games and catfishing pedophiles these are my children and that’s my wife” i didn’t mean to make it sound like we don’t want children we don’t but i didn’t mean to make it sound like that see i just don’t think babies like me very much sometimes babies will point at me and i don’t care for that shit at all like i’ll be on an elevator and a baby will be there in its big like stroller activity tray just like working on one cheerio with bobby fischerlike intensity and it’ll look up at me and go… i like to lean in and go “stop snitchin’ motherfucker” and then walk off ‘cause you’re never too young to learn our national nosnitching policy my friends have babies and i don’t do so well with them i had a runin with a twoyearold girl i know there are better ways to start that story but… my friend jeremy has this twoyearold girl and i really like her she’s a sweet kid i really like his daughter a lot but i was over at his family’s house for the fourth of july and he had his daughter on his knee and it was a very lovely day his whole extended family was there and he was bouncing his twoyearold up and down and he pointed at me and he said to his twoyearold “do you know who that is that’s your uncle john” and i was like “oh my god that’s so sweet i’m her uncle john” and then the baby pointed at me and said “uncle john has a penis” i thank you for laughing because no one did that day fell deadly silent is what they all did hey do you know what you’re supposed to say when a baby points at you and knowingly says “he has a penis” no i’m asking ’cause i don’t know what to say in that situation here’s what i went with that day i said “oh come on” i don’t know i thought that’d be good but then it just made it worse ’cause it sounded like the baby and i had an arrangement not to talk about it and she had violated my trust like the baby had been like “do you have a penis” and i was like “yes i do but you’re a baby so discretion is key” and then the next day she goes “he has a penis” and i go “oh come on someone can’t keep a secret” luckily jeremy’s wife saved the day the baby’s mom saved the day she came in and she picked up the baby and she was like “it’s okay she’s just going through that phase where she says penis and vagina a lot” aren’t we all and by the way it would’ve been a totally different situation if the baby had said vagina like if a grown woman had walked in the room and the baby had been like “she has a vagina” the woman could be like “yes i do and it’s magnificent” and we would all be like “hooray you are brave” no one wants to applaud the penis of a  weirdo it’s fun to be married i’ve never been supervised before i’m supervised she studies what i do like an anthropologist she’ll be like “sometimes he will watch a movie on tv even though he already owns that movie on dvd pointing this out to him confuses and upsets him” i had no supervision when i was a kid we were free to do what we wanted but also with that no one cared about kids i grew up before children were special i did very early ’ right before children became special like i remember when milk carton kids became a thing when they were like “hey we should start looking for some of these guys i don’t think they’re just blowing off steam” no one cared about my opinion when i was a little kid no one cared what i thought sometimes people would say “what do you think you’re doing” but that just meant “stop” they didn’t actually wanna know my thought process they didn’t want me to be like “well i was gonna put this bottle rocket into this carton of eggs so that when i lit off the bottle rocket the eggs would explode everywhere” “oh well that’s very interesting and what brought you to this experiment” “oh well thank you for asking well… you know how i’m filled with rage i’m so horny and angry all the time… and i have no outlet for it so… eggs” your opinion doesn’t matter in elementary school either it matters in college college is just your opinion just you raising your hand and being like “i think emily dickinson’s a lesbian” and they’re like “partial credit” and that’s a whole thing but in elementary school it doesn’t matter what you think it just matters what you know you have to have answers to questions and if you say “i don’t know” you get an x on your test and you get it wrong and that’s not fair ’cause your brain has never been smaller also that’s not how life works i’m in my  now if you came to me now and you were like “hey john name three things that the stamp act of  accomplished” i’d go “i don’t know get out of my apartment” you know but when you’re a little kid you can’t say “i don’t know” you should be able to that should be an acceptable answer on a test you should be able to write in “i don’t know i know you told me but i have had a very long day i am very small and i have no money so you can imagine the kind of stress that i am under” or if it’s one of those true or false questions you should be able to add a third option which is “who’s to say” kids are much more supervised now but also they have a lot of rights like that’s the biggest civil rights increase i’ve seen in my lifetime the rights of children have gone through the roof i had no rights when i was a little kid i remember one time i walked into a supermarket by myself and i walked in through the double doors and the woman behind the register just looked at me and she went “no” and i went “all right” and i turned around and left that’s how broken i was and there weren’t special things for kids the way there are now like we would just go see movies any movie like back to the future that was a movie everyone could see kids could kinda see it great movie right i rewatched it recently it’s a very weird movie marty mcfly is a  high school student whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist and i shit you not they never explain how they became friends they never explain it not even in a lazy way like “hey remember when we met in the science building” they don’t even do that and we were all fine with it we were just like “what who’s his best friend a disgraced nuclear physicist all right proceed” what a strange movie to sell to be a family movie two guys had to go in and do that they had to be like “okay… we got an idea… for the next big familyactioncomedy all right it’s about a guy named marty and he’s very lazy he’s always sleeping late” “okay is he cool like ferris bueller” “no but he does have this best friend who’s you know a disgraced… nuclear physicist” “i’m confused here this best friend this is another student” “no no no no this guy’s either like  or  even we don’t know how old this guy’s supposed to be but one day the boy and the scientist they go back in time and they build a time machine whoa” “okay i think i see where you’re going here they build a time machine and they go back in time and they stop the kennedy assassination” “ah oh wow that’s a really good idea i mean we didn’t even think of that” “all right well what do they do with the time machine” “well now i’m embarrassed to say ah well all right all right all right we thought… we thought it would be funny you know if the boy if he went back in time and you know he tried to fuck his mom” “i don’t know we thought that’d be fun for people but no good point no he doesn’t get to he doesn’t get to ‘cause this family friend named biff he comes in and he tries to rape the mom in front of the son the dad’s gotta beat the rapist off of her and also we’re gonna imply that a white man wrote ‘johnny b goode’ so we’re gonna take that away from ’em” “well this is the best movie idea i have ever heard in my life we’re gonna make three of them now you say they go to the past how about we call it back to the past” “no no no back to the future” “right but they go to the past” “yeah” kids have it very good now my friend’s a teacher she told me that uh… the parents will take the kids’ side over the teacher now that’s insane that never happened my parents trusted every grownup… more than they trusted me i don’t mean coaches and teachers any human adult’s word… was better than mine any hobo or drifter could have taken me by the ear up to my front door and been like “excuse me your kid bit my dick” and my mom would be like “john edmund mulaney did you bite this nice man’s dick” and i would be the only one who’s like “hey doesn’t anyone wanna know why… his dick was near my biters… in the first place isn’t anyone curious… as to how i had access” don’t get me wrong my parents love us they just didn’t like us we weren’t friends people are now like “my mom’s my best friend” i was like “oh is she a super bad mom” my parents didn’t trust us and they shouldn’t have trusted us we were little goblins we were terrible i remember one time we were going to this resort for a vacation when we were little kids three weeks before we went to the resort my dad sat us down and he said “all right we’re going to a resort and i’ve just been informed that the man who owns the resort only has one arm” and we were like “oh yes yay yes” “now i’m telling you three weeks in advance so that you will not freak out when you see that he only has one arm” “oh we’re gonna freak out so bad” “yes john you have a question” “how did he lose his arm” “that’s exactly what you won’t ask” and then i did ask i went into the kitchen one day and i was like “so how’d you lose your arm” and he was like “well i was born with only one arm” and i was like “nah” no my parents loved us it’s just like they were the cops you know and we were criminals so we didn’t get along we only got along in that way that like cops will sometimes be chummy with criminals like when my dad and i would talk it was like that scene in the movie heat when robert de niro and al pacino sit down in that diner we kind of had that rapport of like “hmm we’re not so different you and i you have your law practice and me i have all these fucking markers” “i guess we both have responsibilities when you look at it that way” my dad would respect it if i could get away with breaking a rule we had a rule in our house you were not allowed to watch tv on a school night so every school night i would  be watching tv and i would hear my dad coming i would immediately turn the tv off and grab any book magazine periodical anything and i’d open it and pretend to be doing homework my dad would walk in the room and he would go “what are you doing are you watching tv” and i’d go “no man i’m not watching tv” and the tv wouldn’t even be dark yet it would still have like a neon green halo around it it’d be sizzling like a glass of pepsi and i would look my dad in the eyes and go “no i’m just reading this yellow pages” my dad loved us he just didn’t care about our general happiness or selfesteem i remember one time we were really little kids i have two sisters and a brother and all four of us were in our family car ride for three hours going to wisconsin my dad was driving going down the highway in our white van with wood around the side ‘cause you remember when you wanted your car to be made of wood you remember that era where we were like “how much wood can we get on this car… without it catching on fire” but then the big announcement “we here at plymouthchrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood safely on the outside of your car for all those times you’ve looked at your minivan and thought ‘huh it needs a belt” so we’re going on the highway we’ve been on the road for three hours and in the distance we see a mcdonald’s we see the golden arches and we got so excited we started chanting “mcdonald’s mcdonald’s mcdonald’s mcdonald’s” and my dad pulled into the drivethru and we started cheering and then he ordered one black coffee for himself and kept driving and you know as mad as that made me as a little kid in retrospect that is the funniest thing i have ever seen in my entire life how perfect is that he had a vanload of little kids and he got black coffee the one thing from mcdonald’s no child could enjoy my dad is coldblooded he once shushed a kid during lion king on broadway that actually happened we were at lion king on broadway and there was a fiveyearold behind us going “look it’s pumbaa look it’s timon” and my dad turned around and said “are you going to talk the entire time” he’s my hero the weirdest thing when i was a kid was how much they scared us about smoking weed they scared us about it constantly and i’ve been on tour this year… marijuana is legal in  or  states in some form or another it’s insane yeah well… all right don’t “whoo” if you’re white it’s always been legal for us come on sir we don’t go to jail for marijuana you silly billy when i was arrested with a onehitter at a rusted root concert i did not serve hard time i think i got an award eighteen or  states and by the way i agree it’s a very good thing but it’s also a really weird thing because this is the first time i’ve ever seen a law change because the government is just like “fine” you know i’ve never seen it before like gay marriage and healthcare we have to battle it out in the supreme court and be like “gay people are humans” and they’re like “we’ll think about it” but with weed it was just something we wanted really badly and we kept asking them for  years like “excuse me” and then suddenly the government became like cool parents and they’re just like “okay here take a little we’d rather you do it in the house than go somewhere else… blah blah blah blah blah” those stupid parents and that’s a big deal because they scared us about weed constantly it would be on our sitcoms we’d be watching saved by the bell we’d be having a great old time and then suddenly a character we had not seen before would show up with some weed and the episode would stop cold in its tracks and they’d always hold the joint… the bad guy would hold the joint in a villainous way they’d always offer the joint in a way that no one ever holds a joint like it’s a skull in a shakespeare play and now it’s legal and that is great news unless you’re a weed dealer and then it is terrible news and i don’t just mean because they’re about to lose out to amazoncom i more feel bad for weed dealers ’cause they’re about to find out that we only showed them a certain amount of politeness because they had an illegal product and we don’t show that same politeness to people who deliver legal products like when the chinese food delivery guy comes we don’t let him hang out after he’s delivered the chinese food and we don’t look the other way when he says weird shit to the girls we’re hanging out with… to try to preserve the relationship and we definitely don’t give him some of the chinese food he’s never like “hey can i get in on those dumplings” and we’re like “yeah we’re all friends” what are you on your phone hey vneck hey – what’s your name – sam sam cool what do you do to afford vnecks sam typing numbers ah… numbers the letters of math i’m sorry to bother you i don’t mean to single you out i hate when people get pulled out of the audience like are you familiar with the cirque du soleil sam they’re a group of french assholes that are slowly taking over america by humiliating audience members one by one we once went to see cirque du soleil at navy pier when i was a kid and my brother came and he was  years old you remember being  when you’re like “no one look at me or i’ll kill myself” and these french bastards come into the crowd being like “le volunteer” and they pulled my brother up on stage and i was like “no” and they brought him up and they reached into his sweatshirt and they were like… and they had planted a bra and they pulled out a bra and they were like… and everyone at navy pier was like “ah ha ha ha ha” and my brother was like “that’s great” i have had other jobs besides comedy i was an office temp for a while i really miss that i loved being a temp because i would just go from office to office and be terrible at a different job for a week and then you just get to retire like lou gehrig you’re like “thank you no one will ever see me again” and they’re like “goodbye” i worked at an office once on  street in new york city i was there for a couple weeks i was in a cubicle next to this other cubicle this woman named mischa sat in the other cubicle i want to get the number right i think mischa had… about  photos of her daughter up in her cubicle almost like she was trying to solve a conspiracy about her daughter a beautiful mindstyle i think about mischa two times a week… because of a phone call she had next to me one day it was one of my first days and i was sitting next to her and her phone rang and this was her call and i’m quoting her phone rang and she said “hello hush” and then she hung up think about that two times a week and i didn’t know her well enough by then to be like “hey what kind of a person are you” you know who could she have been talking to “hello hush” this was a place of business my only thought was that it was the ceo of the company being like “mischa help i’m doing a crossword puzzle i need a fourletter word for ‘be quiet’ right now” – “hush” – “you’re promoted” i temped at a little web company on  street in new york city it was a small web company owned by this old man who was old old old money new york his name was henry j finch iv like old old old money like his money was in molasses or something he owned this web company i have no idea why he owned this web company i think he won it in a rich man’s game of dice and small binoculars or something mr finch wore linen suits he had suspenders he had a bow tie he had a hat he had a cane with an ivory handle i’m giving you more description than you need ’cause i need you to believe me this was a real person i knew in the  century mr finch was in his  he had an assistant named mary she was in her  she was korean i don’t know why he had an assistant he did not need one unless he needed someone to be like “remember mr finch at five o’clock you need to keep looking like a hardboiled egg” one day mr finch came into the office it had been raining everything i’m about to say to you was said in front of me on that afternoon mr finch walked into the office and he was wearing a raincoat he was wearing a rain hat and he had his cane and he walked in and he said and i’m quoting “ah one feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet and when one feels like a duck one is happy” and then mary yelled “ooh ducklings” to which mr finch replied “too old to be a duckling quack quack” and then walked into his office i think about that every goddamn day i mean imagine you’re me you’re a  temp and you’re so hungover and you just wanna die every day and then that happens in front of you and i don’t know gives you hope and i did that a little fast let me break that conversation down for you mr finch walked in and he began a conversation the way anyone would “ah” “one feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet” the rain “and when one feels like a duck one is happy” now that’s debatable but rather than debate that point mary brought up a new separate but interesting point… which was “ducklings” but mr finch ever the realist about his own age and mortality… said “ah too old to be a duckling” as if to say “my duckling days are behind me mary don’t you see i’m a duck now and to prove it… well i’ll say just about the most famous catchphrase a duck has… ‘quack quack” and i knew right at that moment by the way that it meant nothing to mr finch what he had said crazy people are like that they have unlimited crazy currency like if i had gone into his office a couple weeks later and been like “hey finch you remember that time you were like ‘too old to be a duckling quack quack’” he would just be like “ah perhaps i did quack but such is life for an old knickerbocker like me” like he’d say something else crazy that’s the wonderful thing about crazy people you know is that they just have unlimited currency the things they say mean nothing to them but they mean everything to me i was once walking into penn station in new york i was walking down  street towards eighth avenue i’m walking down  there’s this woman standing at eighth and  i have my little roller suitcase you can all imagine i’m walking towards her she’s smoking a cigarette that is not lit anymore she’s watching me walk kind of scanning me up and down as if she had terminator vision… where she could see little bits of data like “little honky ass” and could read information as i walked past her she said this to me i walked past her and she said and i’m quoting “eat ass suck a dick and sell drugs” very dirty yes a very upsetting thing to hear yes i’m sorry you all had to hear that but at least you all got to hear it as a group i was alone out there that afternoon and she said this totally unprompted “eat ass suck a dick and sell drugs” it wasn’t like i had paused in front of her and been like “what should i do with my life” so i walk away from her with this todo list and i like structure i like a todo list it did dawn on me that that list of things does get better as it goes along when you really think about it ‘cause it starts in a pretty rough place it starts with just about the worst task a todo list can start with but by the end you have your own small business and isn’t that the american dream when all’s said and done that if you eat enough ass and suck enough dick one day you can sell drugs imagine you did all that to sell drugs and then they legalize drugs and you were like “but i…” this has been a real thrill to perform here by the way i just wanna say that in all sincerity thanks for coming to this really really appreciate it i wanna tell you one more story before i get out of here about the night i met a guy named bill clinton now i don’t… some of you know who that is for those of you that don’t he was president of the united states from  until  and he is a smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declared emperor of the united states of america now i know you know who bill clinton is but i was doing a show at a college and i mentioned bill clinton and like they kind of didn’t know who he was like sorry they knew the name right but they only knew this  bill clinton who’s a very different bill clinton have you seen his ass lately what the hell is he trying to pull he’s all thin now and he wears these little tight suits and he’s got these grandpa reading glasses like “hey i can’t do nothing to nobody no more” “oh me i’m just an old old man i don’t have the appetites” you know and he’s always flying around the world with bill gates trying to cure aids that is not the bill clinton that we all signed up for  years ago our bill clinton was like a big fat buddy garrity from friday night lightslooking guy who played the saxophone on arsenio and his work in the std community was not in curing anything at that time that was the man we all elected president that was the bill clinton that i met i got to meet bill clinton when he was governor clinton in  when he was first running for president and i got to meet bill clinton because my parents had gone to the same college as bill clinton they’re a little younger but they went to the same college so when he was first running for president he would have all these big like alumni fundraisers and everyone who went was invited to go now this was really cool for a couple reasons one i got to meet bill clinton but two i got to watch my parents watch someone they went to school with become the president and that is super funny to see ’cause think about some of the people you went to school with now imagine they’re becoming the president imagine sam was becoming the president it would stir up strong emotions and my parents had very different opinions on bill clinton my mom loved bill clinton ’cause bill clinton was always a really charismatic handsome guy i mean think about how many women he got in the  when he looked like frank caliendo doing john madden now… imagine him as a college student and my mom tells me that there was this sort of chivalrous policy on campus back then where late at night if female students were leaving the library unaccompanied male students were encouraged to wait out in front and offer to walk them home that sounds good right so my mom tells me that bill clinton would be out in front of the library every single night… just being like “hey can i walk ya home hey can i walk ya home hey can i walk ya home hey can i walk ya home” and one night my mom was leaving the library and bill clinton was like “hey can i walk ya home” and my mom was like “hell yes” so… this is absolutely true my mom little ellen stanton walked arminarm with bill clinton to her dorm and she was like “you know i wanted to invite him up for a beer” and i was like “thanks i’m nine” but… her roommate was upstairs so she lost her chance with bill clinton now my dad on the other hand hated bill clinton because my parents were dating during this time and also my dad’s a much more morallyupright conservative kind of guy he always told me that he hated it in college that bill clinton could quote “get away with anything” can you imagine how he felt later so one day this invitation arrives for a fundraiser where you could meet bill clinton my mom opens it first and she goes “oh we have to go we have to go see bill” and without looking up at her my dad just says “why it’s not like he’s gonna remember you” one black coffee same motherfucker so my mom says “fine i’ll go and i’ll take john” and i was like “hell yeah” and i slid in the room in my first communion suit ready to go ‘cause i loved bill clinton i was ten years old if you were a kid when bill clinton was first released it was the most exciting thing ever we’d never seen a cool politician before and he would go on mtv and he’d have cool answers to kids’ questions they’d be like “governor what’s your favorite food” and he’d be like “i don’t know fries” and we’d be like “yay we eat fries” i learned to play his campaign song on the piano it was “don’t stop” by fleetwood mac… from rumours an album written by and for people cheating on each other he let us know who he was right away so i went with my mom as her date… to reconnect with governor bill clinton we walked into the ballroom it was a big hotel ballroom it was the palmer house hilton big hilton hotel ballroom walked into the ballroom it was packed with people it’s actually the ballroom from the end of the movie the fugitive remember so that ballroom so my mom and i walk in it’s packed with people the… sorry the end where harrison ford as dr richard kimble bursts in to confront dr charles nichols right okay so that ballroom so my mom and i walk in it’s packed with people why does kimble confront nichols well i know we all know this but… no no but but but… kimble he found out that nichols along with devlin macgregor and lentz who has mysteriously died they had hired frederick sykes the onearmed man to kill kimble kimble’s wife wasn’t even the target i know we all know this but they were gonna kill kimble because he wasn’t gonna approve certain liver samples to pass  so kimble finds out about all of this and of course he’s furious and he bursts into the ballroom and he goes “you switched the samples” and dr nichols is like “ladies and gentlemen my friend dr richard kimble” what accent did that guy have by the way he goes “you switched the samples and you doctored your research so that you could have provasic” anyway so it’s that ballroom so we walk into that ballroom it was packed with people it was packed with people a real who’s not of chicago celebrities walter jacobson was there walter jacobson was the local fox anchor he’d do fun things where he’d go undercover as a homeless person and he’d be like “oh what time is the soup” and they’d be like “man you’re walter jacobson” he was there everybody and on the far side of the ballroom under a spotlight we saw a little bit of silver hair and it was him… bill clinton the comeback kid but he was surrounded by reporters and photographers and secret service so what are you gonna do well if you’re my mom you ball up the back of my sport coat and you push me forward like a human shield and then you start jogging while yelling “this tenyearold boy has to meet the next president of the united states” kind of implying that i might be dying my feet were not on the ground she was swinging me like a snowplow i was just mowing down fat chicago democrats i pushed past all the reporters i pushed past all the photographers we pushed past all the secret service we land at bill clinton’s feet bill clinton turns looks at my mom and says “hey ellen” ’cause he never forgets a bitch ever my mom melts she goes “hi bill” then it is revealed that she has no plan so… she pushes me towards clinton and she goes “this is my son john and he’s also going to be president” and i was like “what the hell are you talking about i’m not gonna be president” and i know now that i’m definitely never gonna be president not unless everyone gets real cool about a bunch of stuff really quickly based on my tenyearold memory bill clinton is about  feet tall and he leaned down because well i was wearing this button that i bought outside the fundraiser it was a cartoon button of george h w bush and it had a quail flying over his head and it was shitting on his head and it said “birdbrained” and i thought it was very funny and bill clinton leaned down so that only i could hear and he said “hey man i like your button” and i said “you can do whatever you want forever” and he took my advice and… it was the best night of my entire life and i got home that night… i got home that night and my dad was still awake like reading angry under one lamp just like… and i went up to him and i went “hey i’m gonna be a democrat” “and i’m gonna vote for bill clinton” and without looking up at me my dad just said “you have the moral backbone of a chocolate éclair” you know how you talk to a child so here’s the end of that story that was  let’s flash forward five years to  it is now  i am a sophomore in high school bill clinton is in his second term as president and on the morning that the monica lewinsky scandal breaks on the cover of the new york times it had been on the drudge report and then it was on the cover of the new york times that morning i wake up to the newspaper hitting me in the face i am a teenager asleep in bed and the newspaper hits me in the face and falls open on my stomach and i open my eyes to see my dad standing there dressed for work and he says “the other shoe just dropped” and then my dad went in to work to find out that his law firm had been hired to defend bill clinton good night chicago your email address will not be published required fields are marked

            "fade the music out. let’s roll. hold there. lights. do the lights. thank you. thank you very much. i appreciate that. i don’t necessarily agree with you, but i appreciate very much. well, this is a nice place. this is easily the nicest place for many miles in every direction. that’s how you compliment a building and shit on a town with one sentence. it is odd around here, as i was driving here. there doesn’t seem to be any difference between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. people just kind of walk in the middle of the road. i love traveling and seeing all the different parts of the country. i live in new york. i live in a– there’s no value to your doing that at all. “the old lady and the dog”\n",
            "i live– i live in new york. i always– like, there’s this old lady in my neighborhood, and she’s always walking her dog. she’s always just– she’s very old. she just stands there just being old, and the dog just fights gravity every day, just– the two of them, it’s really– the dog’s got a cloudy eye, and she’s got a cloudy eye, and they just stand there looking at the street in two dimensions together, and– and she’s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. i guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5’10”, but now it’s just, like, this sweater and her legs are– her legs are a nightmare. they’re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. her legs are awful. i saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, and he was like, “yecch, no thank you. “i do not want those. “i’d rather just have air down here like i have than to look down at that shit.” i see these two all the time, and i always look at them, and i always think, “god, i hope she dies first.” i do. i hope she dies first, for her sake, because i don’t want her to lose the dog. i don’t think she’ll be able to handle it. if she dies– if the old lady dies first, i’m not worried about the dog because the dog doesn’t even know about the old lady. this dog is aware of three inches around his head. he’s living in two-second increments. the second he’s in and the one he just left is all he knows about, but if he dies, this lady, she’s gonna be destroyed because this dog is all she has, and i know he’s all she has because she has him. there’s no– if she had one person in her life, she would not keep this piece of shit little dog. even if just some young woman in her building one morning were to say, “good morning, gladys,” she’d be like, “good,” and just flush him down the toilet, just– poom! poom! the dog just keeps bumping on the drain. poom! “” she gives up. ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. p-p-p! poom! “my daughter likes fish”\n",
            "you ever flush a pet down the toilet? i had to flush my daughter’s fish down the toilet. i came home, the fish was dead. she wasn’t home from school yet, so i just flushed the fish, and that’s a weird moment, too, ’cause fish live in water. so you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, like, “yeah, he’s dead,” and then you flush, and it looks like he goes, “wait a second! aw, shit! “i was taking a nap! jesus! “you gotta be in constant motion to get any respect in this house.” and then my daughter comes home. “why did he die, da–” come on. what am i gonna say? why did he die? because who gives a shit? that’s the reason. that’s the actual reason, is because didn’t matter that he was alive. that’s why he’s dead. he didn’t know his name, and he didn’t love you back. these are the facts about that fish’s life. my daughter likes fish. we took her to the aquarium. i took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, and we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. i don’t know which one. i don’t care. i don’t think they need to be separate things. i really don’t. they don’t care, and we don’t care. there’s, like, three scientists who give a shit what we call all those things. the scientists could go on tv tomorrow and say, “ok, everybody. “from now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, and–you know what?–penguins are all seals now,” and we would all be like, “yeah, all right. fine. yes. whatever, man.” anyway, so we’re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, and he’s looking back at us through the plexiglas, and he’s going– they’re really disgusting in person. most animals are when you really see them. you ever go to a farm? you think you’re gonna see little, white sheep going, “baa,” but they’re all fat and shit-colored, and they’re like– jesus. that thing is awful. anyway, seals don’t go– they go– my daughter’s like, “what is he saying?” i don’t know! “i’m a slave! kill me!” “the food chain”\n",
            "must be awful to be other kinds of stuff, you know? i’m glad i’m this. this is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. anything else, any other kind of thing, you’re in the food chain. you’re in the food– we are out of the food chain. i don’t know if we fully appreciate the fact that we got out of the food chain. that is a massive upgrade because for every other living thing, life ends by being eaten. that’s how all life ends, is– every single life except human life, every life ends like this. aah! aah! aah! we’re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, just “i love you. bye.” i mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain on top of everything else. imagine if we were in the food chain. it would just be another thing you gotta deal with. you’re already having a bad day. you wake in up in the morning. you’re making breakfast. you burn your toast, and it’s too late to try again, and your kid comes in and says, “beh,” and you’re like, “fine,” and it’s just, “why?” you get a thing in the mail that says that your phone’s different, and your mortgage is another company now. what? i don’t get it! then you’re walking to work like, “why do i even bother? “shit! goddamn it! “there’s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! stop it!” you think that sharks– do you think that sharks would be embarrassed if they knew that we could all see their fins sticking out the top of the water? i think they’d be bummed ’cause i don’t think sharks are aware of that at all. i think sharks think they’re slick. they swim around like, “hey, nobody has any idea what’s down here,” and we’re all up here like, “there’s totally a shark right there.” it wouldn’t be fun being a predator, either. if you’re a predator, imagine if every time you’re hungry, you gotta chase a guy who’s running for his life. you gotta– “come on, dude! shit, get over here!” and just hold him down and bite his neck till he shuts the fuck up for a minute so you can just sit there and eat his stomach before you go to work. that would really suck. that’s why animals just– they go, “let’s do this together, man. “you chase the parents away. i am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.” that’s why they do it like that. “fuck it. i’m eating babies. this is bullshit.” “grownups ain’t worth the meat.” whoops, all right. all right. shit. goddamn it. idiot. this isn’t a gay voice, by the way. it’s not. shut up. yeah. “courtyard confrontation”\n",
            "i live in new york city, and it’s ok there. i live in a nice building. i never lived in a nice place before. when i was growing up, i had no money. i mean, my mom didn’t. didn’t matter. i was a child. but i’m not used to it ’cause it’s nice. there’s, like, a pretty courtyard with flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. i don’t know. what is it with fountains? like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. you can’t get a fountain made without– “can you make me a fountain?” “yes, i’ll get started right away! “yes! yes! it’s finished!” and it’s just little boys pissing on the face of a greek god that looks like him a lot. “just piss on me forever!” anyway, there’s one of those in the courtyard of my building, and my first week in the building about a year ago, i went down to the courtyard for the first time, and i didn’t look too good, you know? it was a sunday morning. that’s my least presentable hour. there’s a lot of, you know, just stains, just like, you know, food and me and whatever… and so i’m sitting there. so? shut up. ha ha ha! anyway, but so there i was. i’m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard and feeling a little out of place. you know, there’s these fancy doormen and stuff, and then there’s this guy looking at me. i notice he’s looking at me from across the courtyard, and he’s all spiffy-looking. he’s got brown shoes, and he’s looking at me like, “” i can tell he was thinking i don’t live in the building. he thinks i just wandered in off the streets and sat in the courtyard. i can tell he’s thinking of coming over and dealing with me on his own, and i’m sitting there thinking, like, “please do that. yes. please, come on, come on. come on, come on, come on,” and i’m trying to look even more gross, and i’m, like, pulling up my shirt, “” and then i see him go, “no. that’s not gonna do at all,” and he comes over to me, “” and i’m like, “num num num!” i’m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation where i’m not wrong at all and he thinks i am. “rrgh!” so he comes over, says, “excuse me, “do you live in this building?” and i said, “no,” ’cause why not start there? i said, “no.” he goes, “well then, what are you doing here?” and i said, “i just need to rest. i’m having a hard time.” he says, “this is private property,” and i said, “well, i don’t really believe in that.” you know, just the worst things i could say from his point of view is basically all the things i was saying, and he goes, “well, if you don’t leave, i’m gonna talk to the doorman.” i was like, “can i just stay, like, five more hours?” so he’s–“no,” and he goes over to the doorman and i see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then i see the doorman going, “no. that guy lives here. it’s ok,” and the look on his face– mwah mwah! num num!– it was just so– it was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. it’s like i had invented a new way to hurt somebody’s feelings. that’s how excited i was. “getting what ‘old’ is”\n",
            "i’m 45 now, so i’m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. i don’t know which one. i won’t know till it’s over where this was. i don’t know how long i’m gonna live. i don’t know. nobody knows, i guess. i think human life expectancy is pretty good. we get a good run, you know? some people die early, you know? if i die now, people will be like, “that’s too bad.” if i die five years from now, they’ll be like, “well, all right,” like it’s not even– it’s– like, as soon as you’re 50, you’re a candidate. you know, there’s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing– you know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. you know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they’re in the news, and it’s always some old guy, “i met napoleon.” no, you didn’t, you liar, you oldest liar in the world. but 45, you know, you’re not old yet, but you start having moments where you kind of start getting what old is, especially if you didn’t take care of yourself, you know? i have moments where i’m like, “wow, this seems early for this.” like, this is something that happens to me a lot. i’ll be sitting watching tv or doing nothing, and all of a sudden, i’ll realize, “i need to wipe my ass right now.” “i mean, nothing happened, but i really gotta wipe my ass right now. right now.” gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. how does this happen already? i’m 45. already, my asshole’s just like, “just– ” my asshole– my asshole’s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, just kinda… loose and ineffectual. my asshole’s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. it’s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. some kid kicks it over on his way home from a tough day at middle school. “rats.” that’s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. here’s another thing about my age right now. if i’m– ok. say i’m sitting down. if i’m sitting anywhere, which–ha ha ha!– i love sitting so much– i would take sitting and doing nothing to standing and fucking any day. this is way better than coming. this is way better. this is what– at my age, if i’m sitting down and somebody tells me i need to get up and go to another room, i need to be told all the information why first. you gotta explain all that shit to me. “what? why do i– no. why, though?” “your car is being towed right now!” “well, that’s what happens to me, then. that’s– i accept that.” ’cause getting up is a whole thing. it means first, i have to decide, “do i really want to be alive anymore?” like, let’s start with that, and then i gotta, “” start kind of rocking to get momentum, “” like i’m trying to get an old honda out of a snow bank. “shit.” “putting on socks”\n",
            "the worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when i have to put on my socks. putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. even if i have a terrible day in the future where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, if that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day will be when i put on my socks because– putting on my socks, that means i have to– here’s what i have to do. i have to get my hands past my pointed toe. i don’t even know how i do it. i’m sitting here. i don’t know how i do that. it’s ’cause you have to– it’s like folding a bowling ball in half. soon as i start, i can feel– i’m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, and i just feel all the systems failing. “beep, beep, beep!” and i have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old and go like this, and i start passing out. and i know other people’s lives are hard. ha ha ha! i know. i saw an interview on tv with michael j. fox, and he has parkinson’s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said it takes him two hours a day, and he said it’s agony, and i saw this and i thought, “ok. that’s hard.” that is hard, and so is putting on my socks. sorry, michael. doesn’t make it easier to know about your thing. tell you what. i’ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks. “if you’re older you’re smarter”\n",
            "i don’t know. i like getting older, though. life is an education, and if you’re older, you’re smarter. i just believe that. if you’re in an argument with somebody and they’re older than you, you should listen to them. it doesn’t mean they’re right. it means that even if they’re wrong, their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. they’ve been there longer. if you’re older, you’re smarter. how many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. ok. that’s about 60 people out of 2,400. here’s the interesting thing. there’s way more. i can see you. there’s so many more. this is arizona. there are way more people in that demographic, but they didn’t clap. why? ’cause they’re smart. they’re sitting in the dark going, “i don’t have to clap. i don’t have to do anything.” they’re not doing it, and they’re right. you know why? ’cause never identify yourself. never. are you crazy? you don’t know why i’m asking. how do you know what– ok. burn them all. burn everybody over 45. how do you know i’m not gonna do that? how many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. that’s every time. “whoo! whoo!” every time. that is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you’re not the only people here. that’s like going to a cancer ward– “not me! whoo! i don’t have it! i don’t have it!” if you’re older, you’re smarter. a 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.d.s, especially smarter than him, ’cause this idiot has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. he’s worthless. the garbage man is 55. he’s had some experience. things have happened to him. he went to cape cod one summer. he saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. he took a bus to montreal. he got a hand job at a fair… from a miner. i mean a miner. not a minor, a miner. you understand? a miner. a grown man who works in a mine with dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. that’s what i’m saying happened to the 55-year-old. you see? he’s had some experience. he knows more. more has happened to him. he’s seen more. he’s seen history. he’s witnessed history, even if it’s not ancient history. he saw nixon resign on live television. me and those few people that clapped, we saw the president of america cry and then quit being the president. that shit was crazy ’cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. today people are like, “the president’s kind of disappointing.” really? our president wept like an insane person and then got on a helicopter and flew away… and the whole nation just watched him go. “getting older makes my life better”\n",
            "i like getting older, though, because for me, the kind of guy i am, getting older makes my life better, you know, like, my sex life, way better at 45, look, ’cause this situation is ok at 45. this is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. and some people, their life is better when they’re younger. you know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. they don’t have to do anything. they just show up with a big adam’s apple and a smelly t-shirt. “hey, i’m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.” “so where do i– everywhere? ok. cool.” but for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. it gets better. i’d like to make one of those “it gets better” ads for just dumpy, young guys. we could use a little help, a little encouragement, just somebody on tv, “listen, man. “i know it’s tough right now. “you’re vaguely heavy with no face. “you have zero value on the sexual marketplace. “you feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, “but it gets better because you’ll all grow up, “and you pretty much look just like this your whole life, “and they don’t. “their options start running out really fast, “and you’re gonna be there. “as long as you stay relatively employed and washed, “you’re gonna be amazing in your 40s. “you’re gonna be– “you’re gonna be the branch that she can grab “before she hits the ground. “it’s gonna be so great. “it just takes time for her circumstances “to match your looks, but it’s gonna happen. “it’s gonna happen. “when real shit matters, you’re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.” it’s just time. that’s all it takes. there’s a formula to this. it’s pussy plus time over income squared. “everybody has their time”\n",
            "everybody has their time. everybody has their time. i mean, not everybody. there are people out there who there’s just nobody for them. yep. people like to say things like, “there’s someone for everyone.” nope! not at all true, and stop saying it ’cause it’s mean to people who never find anybody. there are millions of people out there who we’ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. nobody touches their genitals their entire life. they just wash it, and then they die. that’s all that happens, “aww,” and if you’re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. “aww.” well, go fuck one. “nah.” i didn’t think so. that’s the one way we’re all mean. nobody does that. nobody fucks down, nobody. people fuck up or across. some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. some guy, “yeah. no. you should. i’m totally up. yeah.” “dating takes courage”\n",
            "it’s a weird selection process that we have. dating really is– it’s how we evolve, is dating. it’s how we choose each other, and dating is a real drag for a lot of people, but i always think it’s a nice thing. you know, when i see a date, i’m always happy when i see a couple on a date ’cause it means people are still trying, you know? you see a couple on a date, it means there’s still courage out there. that takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, two very different kinds of courage. the male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. he went up to a random woman who he has no idea if she’s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. everything in your body is telling you, “just go the fuck home and jerk off. don’t do this!” but he walked up and said, “hi. yes,” and she’s like, “” “no, no, no. a second. give me a second,” and you try to get through this membrane of, you know– and then, if it works and you say, “you wanna go out sometime?” sometimes she’ll say yes, and if she says yes, that’s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything i can imagine. a woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species’ existence counts on them doing it, and i don’t know how they– how do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? we’re the number-one threat to women. globally and historically, we’re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. we’re the worst thing that ever happens to them. that’s true. you know what our number-one threat is? heart disease. that’s the whole thing. that’s it, just our own heart going, “dude, i can’t– “you can’t keep doing this. i told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,” but women still– “yeah. i’ll go out with you alone at night.” what are you, nuts? “i’ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. hi. where are we going?” “to your death, statistically.” how do they still do it? if you’re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, and you’re like, “i hope this one’s nice. i hope he doesn’t do what he’s going to do.” “first date”\n",
            "i always– i love when i see a date. you know, when you see a date, you can tell it’s the first date ’cause of the way they’re walking together and she’s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, and he’s just a mess. a guy on a first date just has no actual personality. he’s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive– just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, “well… “ha ha! “well, yes. i think so, too. ha ha! rrgh…” whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, and then sometimes you see a date that’s later down the line and something has happened. there’s something that happens in a date that i never get to witness ’cause women do this. they get to do it inside. they get to just decide quietly, “i’m gonna let him fuck me.” they just get to decide. something he says, and she’s like, “that was good. he’s gonna fuck me later,” and he has no idea. he’s still, like, trying all this shit. he still has no idea he’s already in there. “tits”\n",
            "guys are– we love women a lot– all men do– and we just look at you. that’s what i do. i just look at women. i just–“” like they’re, you know, cakes in windows. i just–“” i was walking in new york once, and there’s these two very cute women walking behind me, and i was trying to walk slowly so i could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, ’cause they were cute, so i wanted to hear them, like that’s gonna help me in any way, to hear their– “don’t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?” ok. here. here i go. thank you. it’s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. if you’re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, “could you squeeze my tit for one second?” and 100% of us will go, “yes, of course.” that doesn’t matter. i could be doing open heart surgery. “yeah. ok.” beep! “don’t worry. he’s not your tits. don’t worry about it.” i don’t know why we love tits so much. some people say it’s because we breastfeed, but so do women, or, you know, baby women. not grown-up women, don’t usually– you don’t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, like, a stately look– you know, like sigourney weaver, like, sucking milk out of a young woman’s tit. “thank you, deborah. i’ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.” it’s not usually the thing, is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, except for at the end of “the grapes of wrath,” which i don’t mean to ruin that book for you, but you should have read it by now. i don’t know if you read “the grapes of wrath,” but that’s how it ends, with an old, dying man sucking milk out of a young girl’s tits, and then the book is over, and you’re like, “jesus! what happened at the end there? that’s crazy.” there’s no other book in that genre. there’s no dense, historic classic that ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very– “and then anna karenina shat on his chest.” “holy moly with that!” “the end.” “my god! “that is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. i’ve been reading this book for three months.” but we do, we love tits, and you always know a tit. you always know a tit. you know, like you ever been in a crowded place– like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium– and you’re smooshed in with other people and your elbow touches a tit behind you, you’re like, “that’s a tit. i just touched it. i know that was a tit. i know it!” because the sensitivity of the male elbow to tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, ’cause you could drive a tack in there, i’m not gonna feel it, but a tit– through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket and her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow… “it’s a tit! i touched a tit! “i touched a tit! i touched one tit. one tit.” that’s rare, to touch one tit. it’s like a four-leaf clover. usually, you touch two. the only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident or you didn’t have permission, but otherwise… when tit access is granted, it’s usually good for two tits at a time. it’s, once you’re on one– you really have to screw up really badly and quickly to lose tit access between tits one and two. you must have said something really dumb on the first tit that you didn’t get the second one. “yeah, it’s like your mom’s dirty whore tit.” “why? what? i said i liked it. “that’s what i meant, is that i like it. “i like your mom’s dirty whore tit, and i like yours,” and if it’s up to the guy, we’re gonna touch both tits. no guy touches a tit and then goes, “you know what? “i’m good with the one. that’s fine for me. everything in moderation.” we’re gonna touch both, even if something terrible happens in the middle of– “yeah–” “there’s a bomb!” “shit! come on, let’s get– “come on! let’s get your tits out of here!” “divorce”\n",
            "i’ve seen a few tits. i’ve seen–i don’t know– 48 maybe. i don’t know. i had my history in my life, you know? i’ve been divorced for five years, and it’s been the best part of my life, being divorced, easily my favorite part of my life. i love being divorced. every year has been better than the last. that is the only time i can say that about, and by the way, i’m not saying don’t get married. if you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, and then get divorced because that’s the best part. it’s the best part. marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, which is divorce, because you just let go and everything’s fine now. divorce is forever. it really actually is. marriage is for how long you can hack it, but divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. nobody ever says, ” my divorce is falling apart. it’s over. i can’t take it.” and again, if you’re in a good marriage, stay in it. if you’re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. i’m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. that’s just a fact. i’m sorry. i’m sorry, but it’s true. everything’s better. my ex-wife and i, this is the best part of our knowing each other. we’re good co-parents because we live apart and we’re friends. our kids go to her half the week, they come to me half the week, and i’m a good father. i’m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. do you know why? ‘cause i get to say good-bye to these kids every week. are you shitting me? it’s like every parent’s fantasy. who can’t be a good father for half of every week? no matter how bad it gets, every wednesday, i get to go, “good-bye, girls. “daddy’s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.” “i’m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.” that’s why i’m such a good dad. “videoing your kids”\n",
            "my daughter was having a dance thing at her school. they had this big dance. anyway, we all went, all the parents, and everybody’s there, and everybody’s got their phone, every single parent. it was an amazing thing to watch ’cause kids are dancing and every parent is standing there like this. every single person was blocking their vision of their actual child with their phone, and the kids– i went over by the stage and the kids– there’s people holding ipads in front of their faces. it looked like we’re all in the witness protection program. like, the kids can’t see their parents, and everybody’s watching a shitty movie of something that’s happening ten feet– like, look at your fucking kid. the resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. it’s totally hd. why are you taping this? you’re never gonna watch it. in a million years, you’re not gonna watch videos of your kids doing shit you missed the first time it happened. you don’t watch it. you just put it on facebook. “here, you watch it. i wanna take a nap now.” and then you get to read all the comments. “my god! “it’s so cute! ngaah!” and guess what? they’re not watching it, either. they’re not watching the video. these kids are dancing for no one. nobody watches the videos on your facebook. they see the first frame of a kid and they go, “that’s very nice. ok. back to this.” nobody’s watching your kids’ videos on facebook, i promise you. i’ll prove it to you. next time you tape your kid’s dance, tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. put that on facebook. everybody will write the same thing. “that’s adorable! i think i see a future star!” “life is a good deal”\n",
            "don’t tape shit on your– life is short. life is very short. i like life. i like it. i feel like even if it ends up being short, i got lucky to have it ’cause life is an amazing gift when you think about what you get with a basic life, not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. if you have a life, that’s an ama– here’s your boilerplate deal with life. this is basic cable, what you get when you get life. you get to be on earth. first of all–my god– what a location. this is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, it fucking sucks so bad. it’s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head ’cause it sucks so bad. you get to be on earth and look at shit, as long as you’re not blind or whatever it is. you get to be here. you get to eat food. you get to put bacon in your mouth. i mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, it doesn’t matter who’s president or anything, you just–“” every time i’m eating bacon, i think, “i could die right now,” and i mean it! that’s how good life is. you get to– you get to fuck. that’s free if you’re smart. that comes with. that’s part of the deal. where else are you gonna get that deal? you get to put your dick in there and go in and out, pretty good, and if you’re a woman, you get to just lay back and just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly anytime you want, anytime you want. if you’re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriend’s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, and it’s nice and warm and tight in there, and he’s your buddy. if you’re a lesbian, you get to do all the stuff they’re doing, and… it’s a great deal. you get to eat. you get to fuck. you get to read “to kill a mockingbird.” it’s a great life. so, you know, i’m not worried about it ending. “behind the wheel”\n",
            "it’s pretty good, and i’ve wasted a lot of time just being angry at people i don’t know. you know, it’s amazing how nasty we can get as people, depending on the situation. like, most people are ok as long as they’re ok, but if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. like, when i’m in my car, i have a different set of values. i am the worst person i can be when i’m behind the wheel, which is when i’m at my most dangerous. when you’re driving, that’s when you need to be the most compassionate and responsible of any other time in your life ’cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it’s the worst people get, and i am the worst. one time, i was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, and he kind of–i don’t know– sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. i said, “worthless piece of shit.” i mean, what an indictment. what kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? “worthless piece of shit”? that’s somebody’s son. and things i’ve said to other people. i was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did– i don’t remember, even– and i yelled out my window, i said, “hey, fuck you!” where outside of a car is that even nearly ok? if you were in an elevator and you were, like, right next to a person’s body and, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, would you ever turn right to their face and go, “hey, fuck you!”? “worthless piece of shit!” no. literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there’s nothing you would not say to them. “i hope you die!” i said that to a person. “i hope you die!” why? ’cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. you tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! so now i hope your kids grow up motherless!” i mean, what am i capable of? i’d like to think that i’m a nice person, but i don’t know, man. “if murder was legal”\n",
            "a lot of it is context. there’s a lot of things i wonder if the world was different. like, if murder was legal, i might have killed a few people. i don’t know. i’d love to think, “i would never do that,” but we really need the law against murder for one simple reason. the law against murder is the number-one thing preventing murder. we’d like to think it’s ’cause, like, “i would never do that.” no. it’s ’cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. if murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor– like you get a thing in the mail– “shit, they had a camera there. well.” if murder was legal, there would be so much murder. regular people would murder. murderers would murder even more, and then really nice, sweet people would murder a few people, but nobody would murder no people. you wouldn’t trust somebody who didn’t murder if murder was legal. you wouldn’t like them. “i never killed anybody.” “ok. nice meeting you. yecch, what a creep. “i mean, not even a hooker? live a life. “what’s wrong with that guy? he’s like a mormon or some shit. i hate those guys.” “i think he’s nice.” “shut up, janet.” they would just– if murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. children would behave very differently because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, that’s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. you know, you’d go to a mall, there’d be, like eight, different moms in the mall just– “i told you to stop it! you didn’t listen to me!” just–pbbt! there’d be just– you’d be stepping over dead kids. there’d be, like, a new problem. “you have to clean up your kids “when you kill them ’cause it’s gross. “it’s bad for the environment. “if you murder your child in a public place, “please use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers “every three feet of america. “put your murdered child in the red bag “with a logo of a murdered kid on it “next to the other logo that tells you “not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag “because they might suffocate, in which case you could just leave them in the bag.” that is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts right in a row, right in a row. that is a compressed area of bad thought. “of course, but maybe”\n",
            "you know, you have your bad thoughts. hopefully you do good things. everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. hopefully, the good thoughts win. for me, i always have both. i have, like, the thing i believe, the good thing– that’s the thing i believe– and then there’s this thing, and i don’t believe it, but it is there. it’s always this thing and then this thing. it’s become a category in my brain that i call, “of course… but maybe…” i’ll give you an example, ok? like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. we have to segregate their food from nuts, have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe… maybe if touching a nut kills you, you’re supposed to die. of course not. of course not. of course not. jesus. i have a nephew who has that. i’d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe… maybe if we all just do this for one year, we’re done with nut allergies forever. no. of course not. of course, if you’re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it’s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course… but maybe… maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it’s not that weird. maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, it’s a tiny bit your fault. of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. listen, listen. you all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. for kids dying from nuts, you applauded, so you’re in this with me now. do you understand? you don’t get to cherry-pick. those kids did nothing to you. of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. of course it is, every time it’s happened– black people in america, jews in egypt. every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it’s a terrible, horrible thing, of course… but maybe… maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. every single thing where you go, “how did they build those pyramids?” they just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. how did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? we just threw chinese people in caves and blew ’em up and didn’t give a shit what happened to them. there’s no end to what you can do when you don’t give a fuck about particular people. you can do anything. that’s where human greatness comes from, is that we’re shitty people, that we fuck others over. even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? because the factory where they’re making these, they jump off the fucking roof ’cause it’s a nightmare in there. you really have a choice. you can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away just so you can leave a mean comment on youtube while you’re taking a shit. thanks a lot, folks. you guys were great. thank you very, very much. thank you. your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * \n",

            "i live– i live in new york. i always– like, there’s this old lady in my neighborhood, and she’s always walking her dog. she’s always just– she’s very old. she just stands there just being old, and the dog just fights gravity every day, just– the two of them, it’s really– the dog’s got a cloudy eye, and she’s got a cloudy eye, and they just stand there looking at the street in two dimensions together, and– and she’s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. i guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5’10”, but now it’s just, like, this sweater and her legs are– her legs are a nightmare. they’re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. her legs are awful. i saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, and he was like, “yecch, no thank you. “i do not want those. “i’d rather just have air down here like i have than to look down at that shit.” i see these two all the time, and i always look at them, and i always think, “god, i hope she dies first.” i do. i hope she dies first, for her sake, because i don’t want her to lose the dog. i don’t think she’ll be able to handle it. if she dies– if the old lady dies first, i’m not worried about the dog because the dog doesn’t even know about the old lady. this dog is aware of three inches around his head. he’s living in two-second increments. the second he’s in and the one he just left is all he knows about, but if he dies, this lady, she’s gonna be destroyed because this dog is all she has, and i know he’s all she has because she has him. there’s no– if she had one person in her life, she would not keep this piece of shit little dog. even if just some young woman in her building one morning were to say, “good morning, gladys,” she’d be like, “good,” and just flush him down the toilet, just– poom! poom! the dog just keeps bumping on the drain. poom! “” she gives up. ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. p-p-p! poom! “my daughter likes fish”\n",
            "you ever flush a pet down the toilet? i had to flush my daughter’s fish down the toilet. i came home, the fish was dead. she wasn’t home from school yet, so i just flushed the fish, and that’s a weird moment, too, ’cause fish live in water. so you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, like, “yeah, he’s dead,” and then you flush, and it looks like he goes, “wait a second! aw, shit! “i was taking a nap! jesus! “you gotta be in constant motion to get any respect in this house.” and then my daughter comes home. “why did he die, da–” come on. what am i gonna say? why did he die? because who gives a shit? that’s the reason. that’s the actual reason, is because didn’t matter that he was alive. that’s why he’s dead. he didn’t know his name, and he didn’t love you back. these are the facts about that fish’s life. my daughter likes fish. we took her to the aquarium. i took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, and we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. i don’t know which one. i don’t care. i don’t think they need to be separate things. i really don’t. they don’t care, and we don’t care. there’s, like, three scientists who give a shit what we call all those things. the scientists could go on tv tomorrow and say, “ok, everybody. “from now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, and–you know what?–penguins are all seals now,” and we would all be like, “yeah, all right. fine. yes. whatever, man.” anyway, so we’re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, and he’s looking back at us through the plexiglas, and he’s going– they’re really disgusting in person. most animals are when you really see them. you ever go to a farm? you think you’re gonna see little, white sheep going, “baa,” but they’re all fat and shit-colored, and they’re like– jesus. that thing is awful. anyway, seals don’t go– they go– my daughter’s like, “what is he saying?” i don’t know! “i’m a slave! kill me!” “the food chain”\n",
            "must be awful to be other kinds of stuff, you know? i’m glad i’m this. this is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. anything else, any other kind of thing, you’re in the food chain. you’re in the food– we are out of the food chain. i don’t know if we fully appreciate the fact that we got out of the food chain. that is a massive upgrade because for every other living thing, life ends by being eaten. that’s how all life ends, is– every single life except human life, every life ends like this. aah! aah! aah! we’re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, just “i love you. bye.” i mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain on top of everything else. imagine if we were in the food chain. it would just be another thing you gotta deal with. you’re already having a bad day. you wake in up in the morning. you’re making breakfast. you burn your toast, and it’s too late to try again, and your kid comes in and says, “beh,” and you’re like, “fine,” and it’s just, “why?” you get a thing in the mail that says that your phone’s different, and your mortgage is another company now. what? i don’t get it! then you’re walking to work like, “why do i even bother? “shit! goddamn it! “there’s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! stop it!” you think that sharks– do you think that sharks would be embarrassed if they knew that we could all see their fins sticking out the top of the water? i think they’d be bummed ’cause i don’t think sharks are aware of that at all. i think sharks think they’re slick. they swim around like, “hey, nobody has any idea what’s down here,” and we’re all up here like, “there’s totally a shark right there.” it wouldn’t be fun being a predator, either. if you’re a predator, imagine if every time you’re hungry, you gotta chase a guy who’s running for his life. you gotta– “come on, dude! shit, get over here!” and just hold him down and bite his neck till he shuts the fuck up for a minute so you can just sit there and eat his stomach before you go to work. that would really suck. that’s why animals just– they go, “let’s do this together, man. “you chase the parents away. i am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.” that’s why they do it like that. “fuck it. i’m eating babies. this is bullshit.” “grownups ain’t worth the meat.” whoops, all right. all right. shit. goddamn it. idiot. this isn’t a gay voice, by the way. it’s not. shut up. yeah. “courtyard confrontation”\n",
            "i live in new york city, and it’s ok there. i live in a nice building. i never lived in a nice place before. when i was growing up, i had no money. i mean, my mom didn’t. didn’t matter. i was a child. but i’m not used to it ’cause it’s nice. there’s, like, a pretty courtyard with flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. i don’t know. what is it with fountains? like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. you can’t get a fountain made without– “can you make me a fountain?” “yes, i’ll get started right away! “yes! yes! it’s finished!” and it’s just little boys pissing on the face of a greek god that looks like him a lot. “just piss on me forever!” anyway, there’s one of those in the courtyard of my building, and my first week in the building about a year ago, i went down to the courtyard for the first time, and i didn’t look too good, you know? it was a sunday morning. that’s my least presentable hour. there’s a lot of, you know, just stains, just like, you know, food and me and whatever… and so i’m sitting there. so? shut up. ha ha ha! anyway, but so there i was. i’m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard and feeling a little out of place. you know, there’s these fancy doormen and stuff, and then there’s this guy looking at me. i notice he’s looking at me from across the courtyard, and he’s all spiffy-looking. he’s got brown shoes, and he’s looking at me like, “” i can tell he was thinking i don’t live in the building. he thinks i just wandered in off the streets and sat in the courtyard. i can tell he’s thinking of coming over and dealing with me on his own, and i’m sitting there thinking, like, “please do that. yes. please, come on, come on. come on, come on, come on,” and i’m trying to look even more gross, and i’m, like, pulling up my shirt, “” and then i see him go, “no. that’s not gonna do at all,” and he comes over to me, “” and i’m like, “num num num!” i’m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation where i’m not wrong at all and he thinks i am. “rrgh!” so he comes over, says, “excuse me, “do you live in this building?” and i said, “no,” ’cause why not start there? i said, “no.” he goes, “well then, what are you doing here?” and i said, “i just need to rest. i’m having a hard time.” he says, “this is private property,” and i said, “well, i don’t really believe in that.” you know, just the worst things i could say from his point of view is basically all the things i was saying, and he goes, “well, if you don’t leave, i’m gonna talk to the doorman.” i was like, “can i just stay, like, five more hours?” so he’s–“no,” and he goes over to the doorman and i see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then i see the doorman going, “no. that guy lives here. it’s ok,” and the look on his face– mwah mwah! num num!– it was just so– it was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. it’s like i had invented a new way to hurt somebody’s feelings. that’s how excited i was. “getting what ‘old’ is”\n",
            "i’m 45 now, so i’m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. i don’t know which one. i won’t know till it’s over where this was. i don’t know how long i’m gonna live. i don’t know. nobody knows, i guess. i think human life expectancy is pretty good. we get a good run, you know? some people die early, you know? if i die now, people will be like, “that’s too bad.” if i die five years from now, they’ll be like, “well, all right,” like it’s not even– it’s– like, as soon as you’re 50, you’re a candidate. you know, there’s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing– you know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. you know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they’re in the news, and it’s always some old guy, “i met napoleon.” no, you didn’t, you liar, you oldest liar in the world. but 45, you know, you’re not old yet, but you start having moments where you kind of start getting what old is, especially if you didn’t take care of yourself, you know? i have moments where i’m like, “wow, this seems early for this.” like, this is something that happens to me a lot. i’ll be sitting watching tv or doing nothing, and all of a sudden, i’ll realize, “i need to wipe my ass right now.” “i mean, nothing happened, but i really gotta wipe my ass right now. right now.” gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. how does this happen already? i’m 45. already, my asshole’s just like, “just– ” my asshole– my asshole’s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, just kinda… loose and ineffectual. my asshole’s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. it’s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. some kid kicks it over on his way home from a tough day at middle school. “rats.” that’s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. here’s another thing about my age right now. if i’m– ok. say i’m sitting down. if i’m sitting anywhere, which–ha ha ha!– i love sitting so much– i would take sitting and doing nothing to standing and fucking any day. this is way better than coming. this is way better. this is what– at my age, if i’m sitting down and somebody tells me i need to get up and go to another room, i need to be told all the information why first. you gotta explain all that shit to me. “what? why do i– no. why, though?” “your car is being towed right now!” “well, that’s what happens to me, then. that’s– i accept that.” ’cause getting up is a whole thing. it means first, i have to decide, “do i really want to be alive anymore?” like, let’s start with that, and then i gotta, “” start kind of rocking to get momentum, “” like i’m trying to get an old honda out of a snow bank. “shit.” “putting on socks”\n",
            "the worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when i have to put on my socks. putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. even if i have a terrible day in the future where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, if that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day will be when i put on my socks because– putting on my socks, that means i have to– here’s what i have to do. i have to get my hands past my pointed toe. i don’t even know how i do it. i’m sitting here. i don’t know how i do that. it’s ’cause you have to– it’s like folding a bowling ball in half. soon as i start, i can feel– i’m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, and i just feel all the systems failing. “beep, beep, beep!” and i have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old and go like this, and i start passing out. and i know other people’s lives are hard. ha ha ha! i know. i saw an interview on tv with michael j. fox, and he has parkinson’s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said it takes him two hours a day, and he said it’s agony, and i saw this and i thought, “ok. that’s hard.” that is hard, and so is putting on my socks. sorry, michael. doesn’t make it easier to know about your thing. tell you what. i’ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks. “if you’re older you’re smarter”\n",
            "i don’t know. i like getting older, though. life is an education, and if you’re older, you’re smarter. i just believe that. if you’re in an argument with somebody and they’re older than you, you should listen to them. it doesn’t mean they’re right. it means that even if they’re wrong, their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. they’ve been there longer. if you’re older, you’re smarter. how many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. ok. that’s about 60 people out of 2,400. here’s the interesting thing. there’s way more. i can see you. there’s so many more. this is arizona. there are way more people in that demographic, but they didn’t clap. why? ’cause they’re smart. they’re sitting in the dark going, “i don’t have to clap. i don’t have to do anything.” they’re not doing it, and they’re right. you know why? ’cause never identify yourself. never. are you crazy? you don’t know why i’m asking. how do you know what– ok. burn them all. burn everybody over 45. how do you know i’m not gonna do that? how many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. that’s every time. “whoo! whoo!” every time. that is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you’re not the only people here. that’s like going to a cancer ward– “not me! whoo! i don’t have it! i don’t have it!” if you’re older, you’re smarter. a 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.d.s, especially smarter than him, ’cause this idiot has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. he’s worthless. the garbage man is 55. he’s had some experience. things have happened to him. he went to cape cod one summer. he saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. he took a bus to montreal. he got a hand job at a fair… from a miner. i mean a miner. not a minor, a miner. you understand? a miner. a grown man who works in a mine with dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. that’s what i’m saying happened to the 55-year-old. you see? he’s had some experience. he knows more. more has happened to him. he’s seen more. he’s seen history. he’s witnessed history, even if it’s not ancient history. he saw nixon resign on live television. me and those few people that clapped, we saw the president of america cry and then quit being the president. that shit was crazy ’cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. today people are like, “the president’s kind of disappointing.” really? our president wept like an insane person and then got on a helicopter and flew away… and the whole nation just watched him go. “getting older makes my life better”\n",
            "i like getting older, though, because for me, the kind of guy i am, getting older makes my life better, you know, like, my sex life, way better at 45, look, ’cause this situation is ok at 45. this is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. and some people, their life is better when they’re younger. you know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. they don’t have to do anything. they just show up with a big adam’s apple and a smelly t-shirt. “hey, i’m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.” “so where do i– everywhere? ok. cool.” but for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. it gets better. i’d like to make one of those “it gets better” ads for just dumpy, young guys. we could use a little help, a little encouragement, just somebody on tv, “listen, man. “i know it’s tough right now. “you’re vaguely heavy with no face. “you have zero value on the sexual marketplace. “you feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, “but it gets better because you’ll all grow up, “and you pretty much look just like this your whole life, “and they don’t. “their options start running out really fast, “and you’re gonna be there. “as long as you stay relatively employed and washed, “you’re gonna be amazing in your 40s. “you’re gonna be– “you’re gonna be the branch that she can grab “before she hits the ground. “it’s gonna be so great. “it just takes time for her circumstances “to match your looks, but it’s gonna happen. “it’s gonna happen. “when real shit matters, you’re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.” it’s just time. that’s all it takes. there’s a formula to this. it’s pussy plus time over income squared. “everybody has their time”\n",
            "everybody has their time. everybody has their time. i mean, not everybody. there are people out there who there’s just nobody for them. yep. people like to say things like, “there’s someone for everyone.” nope! not at all true, and stop saying it ’cause it’s mean to people who never find anybody. there are millions of people out there who we’ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. nobody touches their genitals their entire life. they just wash it, and then they die. that’s all that happens, “aww,” and if you’re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. “aww.” well, go fuck one. “nah.” i didn’t think so. that’s the one way we’re all mean. nobody does that. nobody fucks down, nobody. people fuck up or across. some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. some guy, “yeah. no. you should. i’m totally up. yeah.” “dating takes courage”\n",
            "it’s a weird selection process that we have. dating really is– it’s how we evolve, is dating. it’s how we choose each other, and dating is a real drag for a lot of people, but i always think it’s a nice thing. you know, when i see a date, i’m always happy when i see a couple on a date ’cause it means people are still trying, you know? you see a couple on a date, it means there’s still courage out there. that takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, two very different kinds of courage. the male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. he went up to a random woman who he has no idea if she’s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. everything in your body is telling you, “just go the fuck home and jerk off. don’t do this!” but he walked up and said, “hi. yes,” and she’s like, “” “no, no, no. a second. give me a second,” and you try to get through this membrane of, you know– and then, if it works and you say, “you wanna go out sometime?” sometimes she’ll say yes, and if she says yes, that’s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything i can imagine. a woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species’ existence counts on them doing it, and i don’t know how they– how do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? we’re the number-one threat to women. globally and historically, we’re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. we’re the worst thing that ever happens to them. that’s true. you know what our number-one threat is? heart disease. that’s the whole thing. that’s it, just our own heart going, “dude, i can’t– “you can’t keep doing this. i told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,” but women still– “yeah. i’ll go out with you alone at night.” what are you, nuts? “i’ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. hi. where are we going?” “to your death, statistically.” how do they still do it? if you’re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, and you’re like, “i hope this one’s nice. i hope he doesn’t do what he’s going to do.” “first date”\n",
            "i always– i love when i see a date. you know, when you see a date, you can tell it’s the first date ’cause of the way they’re walking together and she’s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, and he’s just a mess. a guy on a first date just has no actual personality. he’s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive– just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, “well… “ha ha! “well, yes. i think so, too. ha ha! rrgh…” whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, and then sometimes you see a date that’s later down the line and something has happened. there’s something that happens in a date that i never get to witness ’cause women do this. they get to do it inside. they get to just decide quietly, “i’m gonna let him fuck me.” they just get to decide. something he says, and she’s like, “that was good. he’s gonna fuck me later,” and he has no idea. he’s still, like, trying all this shit. he still has no idea he’s already in there. “tits”\n",
            "guys are– we love women a lot– all men do– and we just look at you. that’s what i do. i just look at women. i just–“” like they’re, you know, cakes in windows. i just–“” i was walking in new york once, and there’s these two very cute women walking behind me, and i was trying to walk slowly so i could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, ’cause they were cute, so i wanted to hear them, like that’s gonna help me in any way, to hear their– “don’t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?” ok. here. here i go. thank you. it’s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. if you’re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, “could you squeeze my tit for one second?” and 100% of us will go, “yes, of course.” that doesn’t matter. i could be doing open heart surgery. “yeah. ok.” beep! “don’t worry. he’s not your tits. don’t worry about it.” i don’t know why we love tits so much. some people say it’s because we breastfeed, but so do women, or, you know, baby women. not grown-up women, don’t usually– you don’t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, like, a stately look– you know, like sigourney weaver, like, sucking milk out of a young woman’s tit. “thank you, deborah. i’ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.” it’s not usually the thing, is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, except for at the end of “the grapes of wrath,” which i don’t mean to ruin that book for you, but you should have read it by now. i don’t know if you read “the grapes of wrath,” but that’s how it ends, with an old, dying man sucking milk out of a young girl’s tits, and then the book is over, and you’re like, “jesus! what happened at the end there? that’s crazy.” there’s no other book in that genre. there’s no dense, historic classic that ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very– “and then anna karenina shat on his chest.” “holy moly with that!” “the end.” “my god! “that is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. i’ve been reading this book for three months.” but we do, we love tits, and you always know a tit. you always know a tit. you know, like you ever been in a crowded place– like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium– and you’re smooshed in with other people and your elbow touches a tit behind you, you’re like, “that’s a tit. i just touched it. i know that was a tit. i know it!” because the sensitivity of the male elbow to tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, ’cause you could drive a tack in there, i’m not gonna feel it, but a tit– through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket and her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow… “it’s a tit! i touched a tit! “i touched a tit! i touched one tit. one tit.” that’s rare, to touch one tit. it’s like a four-leaf clover. usually, you touch two. the only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident or you didn’t have permission, but otherwise… when tit access is granted, it’s usually good for two tits at a time. it’s, once you’re on one– you really have to screw up really badly and quickly to lose tit access between tits one and two. you must have said something really dumb on the first tit that you didn’t get the second one. “yeah, it’s like your mom’s dirty whore tit.” “why? what? i said i liked it. “that’s what i meant, is that i like it. “i like your mom’s dirty whore tit, and i like yours,” and if it’s up to the guy, we’re gonna touch both tits. no guy touches a tit and then goes, “you know what? “i’m good with the one. that’s fine for me. everything in moderation.” we’re gonna touch both, even if something terrible happens in the middle of– “yeah–” “there’s a bomb!” “shit! come on, let’s get– “come on! let’s get your tits out of here!” “divorce”\n",
            "i’ve seen a few tits. i’ve seen–i don’t know– 48 maybe. i don’t know. i had my history in my life, you know? i’ve been divorced for five years, and it’s been the best part of my life, being divorced, easily my favorite part of my life. i love being divorced. every year has been better than the last. that is the only time i can say that about, and by the way, i’m not saying don’t get married. if you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, and then get divorced because that’s the best part. it’s the best part. marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, which is divorce, because you just let go and everything’s fine now. divorce is forever. it really actually is. marriage is for how long you can hack it, but divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. nobody ever says, ” my divorce is falling apart. it’s over. i can’t take it.” and again, if you’re in a good marriage, stay in it. if you’re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. i’m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. that’s just a fact. i’m sorry. i’m sorry, but it’s true. everything’s better. my ex-wife and i, this is the best part of our knowing each other. we’re good co-parents because we live apart and we’re friends. our kids go to her half the week, they come to me half the week, and i’m a good father. i’m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. do you know why? ‘cause i get to say good-bye to these kids every week. are you shitting me? it’s like every parent’s fantasy. who can’t be a good father for half of every week? no matter how bad it gets, every wednesday, i get to go, “good-bye, girls. “daddy’s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.” “i’m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.” that’s why i’m such a good dad. “videoing your kids”\n",
            "my daughter was having a dance thing at her school. they had this big dance. anyway, we all went, all the parents, and everybody’s there, and everybody’s got their phone, every single parent. it was an amazing thing to watch ’cause kids are dancing and every parent is standing there like this. every single person was blocking their vision of their actual child with their phone, and the kids– i went over by the stage and the kids– there’s people holding ipads in front of their faces. it looked like we’re all in the witness protection program. like, the kids can’t see their parents, and everybody’s watching a shitty movie of something that’s happening ten feet– like, look at your fucking kid. the resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. it’s totally hd. why are you taping this? you’re never gonna watch it. in a million years, you’re not gonna watch videos of your kids doing shit you missed the first time it happened. you don’t watch it. you just put it on facebook. “here, you watch it. i wanna take a nap now.” and then you get to read all the comments. “my god! “it’s so cute! ngaah!” and guess what? they’re not watching it, either. they’re not watching the video. these kids are dancing for no one. nobody watches the videos on your facebook. they see the first frame of a kid and they go, “that’s very nice. ok. back to this.” nobody’s watching your kids’ videos on facebook, i promise you. i’ll prove it to you. next time you tape your kid’s dance, tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. put that on facebook. everybody will write the same thing. “that’s adorable! i think i see a future star!” “life is a good deal”\n",
            "don’t tape shit on your– life is short. life is very short. i like life. i like it. i feel like even if it ends up being short, i got lucky to have it ’cause life is an amazing gift when you think about what you get with a basic life, not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. if you have a life, that’s an ama– here’s your boilerplate deal with life. this is basic cable, what you get when you get life. you get to be on earth. first of all–my god– what a location. this is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, it fucking sucks so bad. it’s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head ’cause it sucks so bad. you get to be on earth and look at shit, as long as you’re not blind or whatever it is. you get to be here. you get to eat food. you get to put bacon in your mouth. i mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, it doesn’t matter who’s president or anything, you just–“” every time i’m eating bacon, i think, “i could die right now,” and i mean it! that’s how good life is. you get to– you get to fuck. that’s free if you’re smart. that comes with. that’s part of the deal. where else are you gonna get that deal? you get to put your dick in there and go in and out, pretty good, and if you’re a woman, you get to just lay back and just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly anytime you want, anytime you want. if you’re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriend’s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, and it’s nice and warm and tight in there, and he’s your buddy. if you’re a lesbian, you get to do all the stuff they’re doing, and… it’s a great deal. you get to eat. you get to fuck. you get to read “to kill a mockingbird.” it’s a great life. so, you know, i’m not worried about it ending. “behind the wheel”\n",
            "it’s pretty good, and i’ve wasted a lot of time just being angry at people i don’t know. you know, it’s amazing how nasty we can get as people, depending on the situation. like, most people are ok as long as they’re ok, but if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. like, when i’m in my car, i have a different set of values. i am the worst person i can be when i’m behind the wheel, which is when i’m at my most dangerous. when you’re driving, that’s when you need to be the most compassionate and responsible of any other time in your life ’cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it’s the worst people get, and i am the worst. one time, i was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, and he kind of–i don’t know– sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. i said, “worthless piece of shit.” i mean, what an indictment. what kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? “worthless piece of shit”? that’s somebody’s son. and things i’ve said to other people. i was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did– i don’t remember, even– and i yelled out my window, i said, “hey, fuck you!” where outside of a car is that even nearly ok? if you were in an elevator and you were, like, right next to a person’s body and, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, would you ever turn right to their face and go, “hey, fuck you!”? “worthless piece of shit!” no. literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there’s nothing you would not say to them. “i hope you die!” i said that to a person. “i hope you die!” why? ’cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. you tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! so now i hope your kids grow up motherless!” i mean, what am i capable of? i’d like to think that i’m a nice person, but i don’t know, man. “if murder was legal”\n",
            "a lot of it is context. there’s a lot of things i wonder if the world was different. like, if murder was legal, i might have killed a few people. i don’t know. i’d love to think, “i would never do that,” but we really need the law against murder for one simple reason. the law against murder is the number-one thing preventing murder. we’d like to think it’s ’cause, like, “i would never do that.” no. it’s ’cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. if murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor– like you get a thing in the mail– “shit, they had a camera there. well.” if murder was legal, there would be so much murder. regular people would murder. murderers would murder even more, and then really nice, sweet people would murder a few people, but nobody would murder no people. you wouldn’t trust somebody who didn’t murder if murder was legal. you wouldn’t like them. “i never killed anybody.” “ok. nice meeting you. yecch, what a creep. “i mean, not even a hooker? live a life. “what’s wrong with that guy? he’s like a mormon or some shit. i hate those guys.” “i think he’s nice.” “shut up, janet.” they would just– if murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. children would behave very differently because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, that’s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. you know, you’d go to a mall, there’d be, like eight, different moms in the mall just– “i told you to stop it! you didn’t listen to me!” just–pbbt! there’d be just– you’d be stepping over dead kids. there’d be, like, a new problem. “you have to clean up your kids “when you kill them ’cause it’s gross. “it’s bad for the environment. “if you murder your child in a public place, “please use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers “every three feet of america. “put your murdered child in the red bag “with a logo of a murdered kid on it “next to the other logo that tells you “not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag “because they might suffocate, in which case you could just leave them in the bag.” that is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts right in a row, right in a row. that is a compressed area of bad thought. “of course, but maybe”\n",
            "you know, you have your bad thoughts. hopefully you do good things. everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. hopefully, the good thoughts win. for me, i always have both. i have, like, the thing i believe, the good thing– that’s the thing i believe– and then there’s this thing, and i don’t believe it, but it is there. it’s always this thing and then this thing. it’s become a category in my brain that i call, “of course… but maybe…” i’ll give you an example, ok? like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. we have to segregate their food from nuts, have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe… maybe if touching a nut kills you, you’re supposed to die. of course not. of course not. of course not. jesus. i have a nephew who has that. i’d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe… maybe if we all just do this for one year, we’re done with nut allergies forever. no. of course not. of course, if you’re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it’s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course… but maybe… maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it’s not that weird. maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, it’s a tiny bit your fault. of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. listen, listen. you all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. for kids dying from nuts, you applauded, so you’re in this with me now. do you understand? you don’t get to cherry-pick. those kids did nothing to you. of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. of course it is, every time it’s happened– black people in america, jews in egypt. every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it’s a terrible, horrible thing, of course… but maybe… maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. every single thing where you go, “how did they build those pyramids?” they just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. how did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? we just threw chinese people in caves and blew ’em up and didn’t give a shit what happened to them. there’s no end to what you can do when you don’t give a fuck about particular people. you can do anything. that’s where human greatness comes from, is that we’re shitty people, that we fuck others over. even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? because the factory where they’re making these, they jump off the fucking roof ’cause it’s a nightmare in there. you really have a choice. you can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away just so you can leave a mean comment on youtube while you’re taking a shit. thanks a lot, folks. you guys were great. thank you very, very much. thank you. your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * \n",

            "i live– i live in new york i always– like there’s this old lady in my neighborhood and she’s always walking her dog she’s always just– she’s very old she just stands there just being old and the dog just fights gravity every day just– the two of them it’s really– the dog’s got a cloudy eye and she’s got a cloudy eye and they just stand there looking at the street in two dimensions together and– and she’s always wearing like this old sweater dress i guess it was a sweater when she was like 5’10” but now it’s just like this sweater and her legs are– her legs are a nightmare they’re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out her legs are awful i saw a guy with no legs wheeling by and he was like “yecch no thank you “i do not want those “i’d rather just have air down here like i have than to look down at that shit” i see these two all the time and i always look at them and i always think “god i hope she dies first” i do i hope she dies first for her sake because i don’t want her to lose the dog i don’t think she’ll be able to handle it if she dies– if the old lady dies first i’m not worried about the dog because the dog doesn’t even know about the old lady this dog is aware of three inches around his head he’s living in twosecond increments the second he’s in and the one he just left is all he knows about but if he dies this lady she’s gonna be destroyed because this dog is all she has and i know he’s all she has because she has him there’s no– if she had one person in her life she would not keep this piece of shit little dog even if just some young woman in her building one morning were to say “good morning gladys” she’d be like “good” and just flush him down the toilet just– poom poom the dog just keeps bumping on the drain poom “” she gives up ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life ppp poom “my daughter likes fish”\n",
            "you ever flush a pet down the toilet i had to flush my daughter’s fish down the toilet i came home the fish was dead she wasn’t home from school yet so i just flushed the fish and that’s a weird moment too ’cause fish live in water so you put it in the toilet floats to the bottom like “yeah he’s dead” and then you flush and it looks like he goes “wait a second aw shit “i was taking a nap jesus “you gotta be in constant motion to get any respect in this house” and then my daughter comes home “why did he die da–” come on what am i gonna say why did he die because who gives a shit that’s the reason that’s the actual reason is because didn’t matter that he was alive that’s why he’s dead he didn’t know his name and he didn’t love you back these are the facts about that fish’s life my daughter likes fish we took her to the aquarium i took both my kids to the aquarium in boston and we were looking at this seal or sea lion i don’t know which one i don’t care i don’t think they need to be separate things i really don’t they don’t care and we don’t care there’s like three scientists who give a shit what we call all those things the scientists could go on tv tomorrow and say “ok everybody “from now on seals and sea lions and walruses and–you know what–penguins are all seals now” and we would all be like “yeah all right fine yes whatever man” anyway so we’re looking at this sealsea lion thing and he’s looking back at us through the plexiglas and he’s going– they’re really disgusting in person most animals are when you really see them you ever go to a farm you think you’re gonna see little white sheep going “baa” but they’re all fat and shitcolored and they’re like– jesus that thing is awful anyway seals don’t go– they go– my daughter’s like “what is he saying” i don’t know “i’m a slave kill me” “the food chain”\n",
            "must be awful to be other kinds of stuff you know i’m glad i’m this this is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives anything else any other kind of thing you’re in the food chain you’re in the food– we are out of the food chain i don’t know if we fully appreciate the fact that we got out of the food chain that is a massive upgrade because for every other living thing life ends by being eaten that’s how all life ends is– every single life except human life every life ends like this aah aah aah we’re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed just “i love you bye” i mean imagine if we were still in the food chain on top of everything else imagine if we were in the food chain it would just be another thing you gotta deal with you’re already having a bad day you wake in up in the morning you’re making breakfast you burn your toast and it’s too late to try again and your kid comes in and says “beh” and you’re like “fine” and it’s just “why” you get a thing in the mail that says that your phone’s different and your mortgage is another company now what i don’t get it then you’re walking to work like “why do i even bother “shit goddamn it “there’s always fucking cheetahs at the train station stop it” you think that sharks– do you think that sharks would be embarrassed if they knew that we could all see their fins sticking out the top of the water i think they’d be bummed ’cause i don’t think sharks are aware of that at all i think sharks think they’re slick they swim around like “hey nobody has any idea what’s down here” and we’re all up here like “there’s totally a shark right there” it wouldn’t be fun being a predator either if you’re a predator imagine if every time you’re hungry you gotta chase a guy who’s running for his life you gotta– “come on dude shit get over here” and just hold him down and bite his neck till he shuts the fuck up for a minute so you can just sit there and eat his stomach before you go to work that would really suck that’s why animals just– they go “let’s do this together man “you chase the parents away i am gonna eat the kid and you circle back” that’s why they do it like that “fuck it i’m eating babies this is bullshit” “grownups ain’t worth the meat” whoops all right all right shit goddamn it idiot this isn’t a gay voice by the way it’s not shut up yeah “courtyard confrontation”\n",

            "the worst part of my day worst part of every day of my life is when i have to put on my socks putting on my socks is the worst part of every day and it always will be even if i have a terrible day in the future where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother if that ever happened to me the worst part of that day will be when i put on my socks because– putting on my socks that means i have to– here’s what i have to do i have to get my hands past my pointed toe i don’t even know how i do it i’m sitting here i don’t know how i do that it’s ’cause you have to– it’s like folding a bowling ball in half soon as i start i can feel– i’m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs and i just feel all the systems failing “beep beep beep” and i have to like lay on my back like an eightyearold and go like this and i start passing out and i know other people’s lives are hard ha ha ha i know i saw an interview on tv with michael j fox and he has parkinson’s and he was describing brushing his teeth and he said it takes him two hours a day and he said it’s agony and i saw this and i thought “ok that’s hard” that is hard and so is putting on my socks sorry michael doesn’t make it easier to know about your thing tell you what i’ll help you brush your teeth you help me with the socks “if you’re older you’re smarter”\n",
            "i don’t know i like getting older though life is an education and if you’re older you’re smarter i just believe that if you’re in an argument with somebody and they’re older than you you should listen to them it doesn’t mean they’re right it means that even if they’re wrong their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have they’ve been there longer if you’re older you’re smarter how many people here by applause are 45 or older 45 or older applaud ok that’s about 60 people out of 2400 here’s the interesting thing there’s way more i can see you there’s so many more this is arizona there are way more people in that demographic but they didn’t clap why ’cause they’re smart they’re sitting in the dark going “i don’t have to clap i don’t have to do anything” they’re not doing it and they’re right you know why ’cause never identify yourself never are you crazy you don’t know why i’m asking how do you know what– ok burn them all burn everybody over 45 how do you know i’m not gonna do that how many people here by applause are 40 or younger 40 or younger applaud that’s every time “whoo whoo” every time that is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you’re not the only people here that’s like going to a cancer ward– “not me whoo i don’t have it i don’t have it” if you’re older you’re smarter a 55yearold garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28yearold with three phds especially smarter than him ’cause this idiot has been thinking about three things for like 15 years he’s worthless the garbage man is 55 he’s had some experience things have happened to him he went to cape cod one summer he saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool he took a bus to montreal he got a hand job at a fair… from a miner i mean a miner not a minor a miner you understand a miner a grown man who works in a mine with dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair that’s what i’m saying happened to the 55yearold you see he’s had some experience he knows more more has happened to him he’s seen more he’s seen history he’s witnessed history even if it’s not ancient history he saw nixon resign on live television me and those few people that clapped we saw the president of america cry and then quit being the president that shit was crazy ’cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next today people are like “the president’s kind of disappointing” really our president wept like an insane person and then got on a helicopter and flew away… and the whole nation just watched him go “getting older makes my life better”\n",
            "i like getting older though because for me the kind of guy i am getting older makes my life better you know like my sex life way better at 45 look ’cause this situation is ok at 45 this is not a fun kind of a 17yearold to be and some people their life is better when they’re younger you know young dudes young skinny dudes best life in the world is being a young skinny dude they don’t have to do anything they just show up with a big adam’s apple and a smelly tshirt “hey i’m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life” “so where do i– everywhere ok cool” but for guys like me this is not a fun youth it gets better i’d like to make one of those “it gets better” ads for just dumpy young guys we could use a little help a little encouragement just somebody on tv “listen man “i know it’s tough right now “you’re vaguely heavy with no face “you have zero value on the sexual marketplace “you feel invisible to the girls in school because you are “but it gets better because you’ll all grow up “and you pretty much look just like this your whole life “and they don’t “their options start running out really fast “and you’re gonna be there “as long as you stay relatively employed and washed “you’re gonna be amazing in your 40s “you’re gonna be– “you’re gonna be the branch that she can grab “before she hits the ground “it’s gonna be so great “it just takes time for her circumstances “to match your looks but it’s gonna happen “it’s gonna happen “when real shit matters you’re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world” it’s just time that’s all it takes there’s a formula to this it’s pussy plus time over income squared “everybody has their time”\n",
            "everybody has their time everybody has their time i mean not everybody there are people out there who there’s just nobody for them yep people like to say things like “there’s someone for everyone” nope not at all true and stop saying it ’cause it’s mean to people who never find anybody there are millions of people out there who we’ve all unanimously decided they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips even nobody touches their genitals their entire life they just wash it and then they die that’s all that happens “aww” and if you’re feeling bad for them you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart “aww” well go fuck one “nah” i didn’t think so that’s the one way we’re all mean nobody does that nobody fucks down nobody people fuck up or across some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up some guy “yeah no you should i’m totally up yeah” “dating takes courage”\n",
            "it’s a weird selection process that we have dating really is– it’s how we evolve is dating it’s how we choose each other and dating is a real drag for a lot of people but i always think it’s a nice thing you know when i see a date i’m always happy when i see a couple on a date ’cause it means people are still trying you know you see a couple on a date it means there’s still courage out there that takes courage to go on a date for both sides two very different kinds of courage the male courage traditionally speaking is that he decided to ask he went up to a random woman who he has no idea if she’s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified everything in your body is telling you “just go the fuck home and jerk off don’t do this” but he walked up and said “hi yes” and she’s like “” “no no no a second give me a second” and you try to get through this membrane of you know– and then if it works and you say “you wanna go out sometime” sometimes she’ll say yes and if she says yes that’s her courage and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything i can imagine a woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and illadvised and the whole species’ existence counts on them doing it and i don’t know how they– how do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men we’re the numberone threat to women globally and historically we’re the numberone cause of injury and mayhem to women we’re the worst thing that ever happens to them that’s true you know what our numberone threat is heart disease that’s the whole thing that’s it just our own heart going “dude i can’t– “you can’t keep doing this i told you three strokes ago that this is not smart” but women still– “yeah i’ll go out with you alone at night” what are you nuts “i’ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders hi where are we going” “to your death statistically” how do they still do it if you’re a guy try to imagine that you could only date a halfbear halflion and you’re like “i hope this one’s nice i hope he doesn’t do what he’s going to do” “first date”\n",
            "i always– i love when i see a date you know when you see a date you can tell it’s the first date ’cause of the way they’re walking together and she’s looking up at his face trying to figure him out and he’s just a mess a guy on a first date just has no actual personality he’s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each just anything no cohesive– just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines just you know “well… “ha ha “well yes i think so too ha ha rrgh…” whatever just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions hoping to find pay dirt at someplace and then sometimes you see a date that’s later down the line and something has happened there’s something that happens in a date that i never get to witness ’cause women do this they get to do it inside they get to just decide quietly “i’m gonna let him fuck me” they just get to decide something he says and she’s like “that was good he’s gonna fuck me later” and he has no idea he’s still like trying all this shit he still has no idea he’s already in there “tits”\n",
            "guys are– we love women a lot– all men do– and we just look at you that’s what i do i just look at women i just–“” like they’re you know cakes in windows i just–“” i was walking in new york once and there’s these two very cute women walking behind me and i was trying to walk slowly so i could hear what they were saying to each other you know ’cause they were cute so i wanted to hear them like that’s gonna help me in any way to hear their– “don’t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for like one second” ok here here i go thank you it’s really a flaw in men that we would all do that if you’re a woman you could ask any guy on planet earth “could you squeeze my tit for one second” and 100 of us will go “yes of course” that doesn’t matter i could be doing open heart surgery “yeah ok” beep “don’t worry he’s not your tits don’t worry about it” i don’t know why we love tits so much some people say it’s because we breastfeed but so do women or you know baby women not grownup women don’t usually– you don’t see like a 68yearold woman like a stately look– you know like sigourney weaver like sucking milk out of a young woman’s tit “thank you deborah i’ll see you tomorrow at 200” it’s not usually the thing is the elderly breastfeeding from the young except for at the end of “the grapes of wrath” which i don’t mean to ruin that book for you but you should have read it by now i don’t know if you read “the grapes of wrath” but that’s how it ends with an old dying man sucking milk out of a young girl’s tits and then the book is over and you’re like “jesus what happened at the end there that’s crazy” there’s no other book in that genre there’s no dense historic classic that ends with a weird porny paragraph at the very– “and then anna karenina shat on his chest” “holy moly with that” “the end” “my god “that is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book i’ve been reading this book for three months” but we do we love tits and you always know a tit you always know a tit you know like you ever been in a crowded place– like a subway or like you know a sports stadium– and you’re smooshed in with other people and your elbow touches a tit behind you you’re like “that’s a tit i just touched it i know that was a tit i know it” because the sensitivity of the male elbow to tit flesh specifically is unbelievable just to tits ’cause you could drive a tack in there i’m not gonna feel it but a tit– through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket and her jacket sweater shirt and bra somehow… “it’s a tit i touched a tit “i touched a tit i touched one tit one tit” that’s rare to touch one tit it’s like a fourleaf clover usually you touch two the only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident or you didn’t have permission but otherwise… when tit access is granted it’s usually good for two tits at a time it’s once you’re on one– you really have to screw up really badly and quickly to lose tit access between tits one and two you must have said something really dumb on the first tit that you didn’t get the second one “yeah it’s like your mom’s dirty whore tit” “why what i said i liked it “that’s what i meant is that i like it “i like your mom’s dirty whore tit and i like yours” and if it’s up to the guy we’re gonna touch both tits no guy touches a tit and then goes “you know what “i’m good with the one that’s fine for me everything in moderation” we’re gonna touch both even if something terrible happens in the middle of– “yeah–” “there’s a bomb” “shit come on let’s get– “come on let’s get your tits out of here” “divorce”\n",
            "i’ve seen a few tits i’ve seen–i don’t know– 48 maybe i don’t know i had my history in my life you know i’ve been divorced for five years and it’s been the best part of my life being divorced easily my favorite part of my life i love being divorced every year has been better than the last that is the only time i can say that about and by the way i’m not saying don’t get married if you meet somebody fall in love and get married and then get divorced because that’s the best part it’s the best part marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness which is divorce because you just let go and everything’s fine now divorce is forever it really actually is marriage is for how long you can hack it but divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak nobody ever says ” my divorce is falling apart it’s over i can’t take it” and again if you’re in a good marriage stay in it if you’re in the best marriage ever stay in it i’m just saying if you got out it would be better that’s just a fact i’m sorry i’m sorry but it’s true everything’s better my exwife and i this is the best part of our knowing each other we’re good coparents because we live apart and we’re friends our kids go to her half the week they come to me half the week and i’m a good father i’m an attentive focused and responsible father do you know why ‘cause i get to say goodbye to these kids every week are you shitting me it’s like every parent’s fantasy who can’t be a good father for half of every week no matter how bad it gets every wednesday i get to go “goodbye girls “daddy’s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now” “i’m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here” that’s why i’m such a good dad “videoing your kids”\n",
            "my daughter was having a dance thing at her school they had this big dance anyway we all went all the parents and everybody’s there and everybody’s got their phone every single parent it was an amazing thing to watch ’cause kids are dancing and every parent is standing there like this every single person was blocking their vision of their actual child with their phone and the kids– i went over by the stage and the kids– there’s people holding ipads in front of their faces it looked like we’re all in the witness protection program like the kids can’t see their parents and everybody’s watching a shitty movie of something that’s happening ten feet– like look at your fucking kid the resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look it’s totally hd why are you taping this you’re never gonna watch it in a million years you’re not gonna watch videos of your kids doing shit you missed the first time it happened you don’t watch it you just put it on facebook “here you watch it i wanna take a nap now” and then you get to read all the comments “my god “it’s so cute ngaah” and guess what they’re not watching it either they’re not watching the video these kids are dancing for no one nobody watches the videos on your facebook they see the first frame of a kid and they go “that’s very nice ok back to this” nobody’s watching your kids’ videos on facebook i promise you i’ll prove it to you next time you tape your kid’s dance tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes tack it onto your kid dancing for a second put that on facebook everybody will write the same thing “that’s adorable i think i see a future star” “life is a good deal”\n",
            "don’t tape shit on your– life is short life is very short i like life i like it i feel like even if it ends up being short i got lucky to have it ’cause life is an amazing gift when you think about what you get with a basic life not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life if you have a life that’s an ama– here’s your boilerplate deal with life this is basic cable what you get when you get life you get to be on earth first of all–my god– what a location this is earth and for trillions of miles in every direction it fucking sucks so bad it’s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head ’cause it sucks so bad you get to be on earth and look at shit as long as you’re not blind or whatever it is you get to be here you get to eat food you get to put bacon in your mouth i mean when you have bacon in your mouth it doesn’t matter who’s president or anything you just–“” every time i’m eating bacon i think “i could die right now” and i mean it that’s how good life is you get to– you get to fuck that’s free if you’re smart that comes with that’s part of the deal where else are you gonna get that deal you get to put your dick in there and go in and out pretty good and if you’re a woman you get to just lay back and just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly anytime you want anytime you want if you’re a gay man you get to just fill your boyfriend’s ass with your dick just fill it all the way to the balls and it’s nice and warm and tight in there and he’s your buddy if you’re a lesbian you get to do all the stuff they’re doing and… it’s a great deal you get to eat you get to fuck you get to read “to kill a mockingbird” it’s a great life so you know i’m not worried about it ending “behind the wheel”\n",
            "it’s pretty good and i’ve wasted a lot of time just being angry at people i don’t know you know it’s amazing how nasty we can get as people depending on the situation like most people are ok as long as they’re ok but if you put people in certain contexts they just change like when i’m in my car i have a different set of values i am the worst person i can be when i’m behind the wheel which is when i’m at my most dangerous when you’re driving that’s when you need to be the most compassionate and responsible of any other time in your life ’cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons and yet it’s the worst people get and i am the worst one time i was driving and there was a guy ahead of me and he kind of–i don’t know– sorta drifted into my lane for a second and this came out of my mouth i said “worthless piece of shit” i mean what an indictment what kind of a way is that to feel about another human being “worthless piece of shit” that’s somebody’s son and things i’ve said to other people i was once driving and some guy in a pickup truck did– i don’t remember even– and i yelled out my window i said “hey fuck you” where outside of a car is that even nearly ok if you were in an elevator and you were like right next to a person’s body and whatever like he leaned into you a little bit would you ever turn right to their face and go “hey fuck you” “worthless piece of shit” no literally zero people would ever do that but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you there’s nothing you would not say to them “i hope you die” i said that to a person “i hope you die” why ’cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life you tested my reflexes and it worked out fine so now i hope your kids grow up motherless” i mean what am i capable of i’d like to think that i’m a nice person but i don’t know man “if murder was legal”\n",
            "a lot of it is context there’s a lot of things i wonder if the world was different like if murder was legal i might have killed a few people i don’t know i’d love to think “i would never do that” but we really need the law against murder for one simple reason the law against murder is the numberone thing preventing murder we’d like to think it’s ’cause like “i would never do that” no it’s ’cause it really sucks getting caught murdering a lot if murder was legal or just a misdemeanor– like you get a thing in the mail– “shit they had a camera there well” if murder was legal there would be so much murder regular people would murder murderers would murder even more and then really nice sweet people would murder a few people but nobody would murder no people you wouldn’t trust somebody who didn’t murder if murder was legal you wouldn’t like them “i never killed anybody” “ok nice meeting you yecch what a creep “i mean not even a hooker live a life “what’s wrong with that guy he’s like a mormon or some shit i hate those guys” “i think he’s nice” “shut up janet” they would just– if murder was legal there would be a lot of murder children would behave very differently because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids that’s mostly what would happen if murder was legal you know you’d go to a mall there’d be like eight different moms in the mall just– “i told you to stop it you didn’t listen to me” just–pbbt there’d be just– you’d be stepping over dead kids there’d be like a new problem “you have to clean up your kids “when you kill them ’cause it’s gross “it’s bad for the environment “if you murder your child in a public place “please use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers “every three feet of america “put your murdered child in the red bag “with a logo of a murdered kid on it “next to the other logo that tells you “not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag “because they might suffocate in which case you could just leave them in the bag” that is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts right in a row right in a row that is a compressed area of bad thought “of course but maybe”\n",
            "you know you have your bad thoughts hopefully you do good things everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts hopefully the good thoughts win for me i always have both i have like the thing i believe the good thing– that’s the thing i believe– and then there’s this thing and i don’t believe it but it is there it’s always this thing and then this thing it’s become a category in my brain that i call “of course… but maybe…” i’ll give you an example ok like of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected of course we have to segregate their food from nuts have their medication available at all times and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies of course but maybe… maybe if touching a nut kills you you’re supposed to die of course not of course not of course not jesus i have a nephew who has that i’d be devastated if something happened to him but maybe… maybe if we all just do this for one year we’re done with nut allergies forever no of course not of course if you’re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt it’s a terrible tragedy of course of course… but maybe… maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot it’s not that weird maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at it’s a tiny bit your fault of course of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened listen listen you all clapped for dead kids with the nuts for kids dying from nuts you applauded so you’re in this with me now do you understand you don’t get to cherrypick those kids did nothing to you of course of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened of course it is every time it’s happened– black people in america jews in egypt every time a whole race of people has been enslaved it’s a terrible horrible thing of course… but maybe… maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves every single thing where you go “how did they build those pyramids” they just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished how did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly we just threw chinese people in caves and blew ’em up and didn’t give a shit what happened to them there’s no end to what you can do when you don’t give a fuck about particular people you can do anything that’s where human greatness comes from is that we’re shitty people that we fuck others over even today how do we have this amazing microtechnology because the factory where they’re making these they jump off the fucking roof ’cause it’s a nightmare in there you really have a choice you can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away just so you can leave a mean comment on youtube while you’re taking a shit thanks a lot folks you guys were great thank you very very much thank you your email address will not be published required fields are marked  \n",

            "i live– i live in new york i always– like there’s this old lady in my neighborhood and she’s always walking her dog she’s always just– she’s very old she just stands there just being old and the dog just fights gravity every day just– the two of them it’s really– the dog’s got a cloudy eye and she’s got a cloudy eye and they just stand there looking at the street in two dimensions together and– and she’s always wearing like this old sweater dress i guess it was a sweater when she was like ’” but now it’s just like this sweater and her legs are– her legs are a nightmare they’re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out her legs are awful i saw a guy with no legs wheeling by and he was like “yecch no thank you “i do not want those “i’d rather just have air down here like i have than to look down at that shit” i see these two all the time and i always look at them and i always think “god i hope she dies first” i do i hope she dies first for her sake because i don’t want her to lose the dog i don’t think she’ll be able to handle it if she dies– if the old lady dies first i’m not worried about the dog because the dog doesn’t even know about the old lady this dog is aware of three inches around his head he’s living in twosecond increments the second he’s in and the one he just left is all he knows about but if he dies this lady she’s gonna be destroyed because this dog is all she has and i know he’s all she has because she has him there’s no– if she had one person in her life she would not keep this piece of shit little dog even if just some young woman in her building one morning were to say “good morning gladys” she’d be like “good” and just flush him down the toilet just– poom poom the dog just keeps bumping on the drain poom “” she gives up ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life ppp poom “my daughter likes fish”\n",
            "you ever flush a pet down the toilet i had to flush my daughter’s fish down the toilet i came home the fish was dead she wasn’t home from school yet so i just flushed the fish and that’s a weird moment too ’cause fish live in water so you put it in the toilet floats to the bottom like “yeah he’s dead” and then you flush and it looks like he goes “wait a second aw shit “i was taking a nap jesus “you gotta be in constant motion to get any respect in this house” and then my daughter comes home “why did he die da–” come on what am i gonna say why did he die because who gives a shit that’s the reason that’s the actual reason is because didn’t matter that he was alive that’s why he’s dead he didn’t know his name and he didn’t love you back these are the facts about that fish’s life my daughter likes fish we took her to the aquarium i took both my kids to the aquarium in boston and we were looking at this seal or sea lion i don’t know which one i don’t care i don’t think they need to be separate things i really don’t they don’t care and we don’t care there’s like three scientists who give a shit what we call all those things the scientists could go on tv tomorrow and say “ok everybody “from now on seals and sea lions and walruses and–you know what–penguins are all seals now” and we would all be like “yeah all right fine yes whatever man” anyway so we’re looking at this sealsea lion thing and he’s looking back at us through the plexiglas and he’s going– they’re really disgusting in person most animals are when you really see them you ever go to a farm you think you’re gonna see little white sheep going “baa” but they’re all fat and shitcolored and they’re like– jesus that thing is awful anyway seals don’t go– they go– my daughter’s like “what is he saying” i don’t know “i’m a slave kill me” “the food chain”\n",
            "must be awful to be other kinds of stuff you know i’m glad i’m this this is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives anything else any other kind of thing you’re in the food chain you’re in the food– we are out of the food chain i don’t know if we fully appreciate the fact that we got out of the food chain that is a massive upgrade because for every other living thing life ends by being eaten that’s how all life ends is– every single life except human life every life ends like this aah aah aah we’re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed just “i love you bye” i mean imagine if we were still in the food chain on top of everything else imagine if we were in the food chain it would just be another thing you gotta deal with you’re already having a bad day you wake in up in the morning you’re making breakfast you burn your toast and it’s too late to try again and your kid comes in and says “beh” and you’re like “fine” and it’s just “why” you get a thing in the mail that says that your phone’s different and your mortgage is another company now what i don’t get it then you’re walking to work like “why do i even bother “shit goddamn it “there’s always fucking cheetahs at the train station stop it” you think that sharks– do you think that sharks would be embarrassed if they knew that we could all see their fins sticking out the top of the water i think they’d be bummed ’cause i don’t think sharks are aware of that at all i think sharks think they’re slick they swim around like “hey nobody has any idea what’s down here” and we’re all up here like “there’s totally a shark right there” it wouldn’t be fun being a predator either if you’re a predator imagine if every time you’re hungry you gotta chase a guy who’s running for his life you gotta– “come on dude shit get over here” and just hold him down and bite his neck till he shuts the fuck up for a minute so you can just sit there and eat his stomach before you go to work that would really suck that’s why animals just– they go “let’s do this together man “you chase the parents away i am gonna eat the kid and you circle back” that’s why they do it like that “fuck it i’m eating babies this is bullshit” “grownups ain’t worth the meat” whoops all right all right shit goddamn it idiot this isn’t a gay voice by the way it’s not shut up yeah “courtyard confrontation”\n",
            "i live in new york city and it’s ok there i live in a nice building i never lived in a nice place before when i was growing up i had no money i mean my mom didn’t didn’t matter i was a child but i’m not used to it ’cause it’s nice there’s like a pretty courtyard with flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing i don’t know what is it with fountains like all fountain sculptors are pedophiles basically you can’t get a fountain made without– “can you make me a fountain” “yes i’ll get started right away “yes yes it’s finished” and it’s just little boys pissing on the face of a greek god that looks like him a lot “just piss on me forever” anyway there’s one of those in the courtyard of my building and my first week in the building about a year ago i went down to the courtyard for the first time and i didn’t look too good you know it was a sunday morning that’s my least presentable hour there’s a lot of you know just stains just like you know food and me and whatever… and so i’m sitting there so shut up ha ha ha anyway but so there i was i’m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard and feeling a little out of place you know there’s these fancy doormen and stuff and then there’s this guy looking at me i notice he’s looking at me from across the courtyard and he’s all spiffylooking he’s got brown shoes and he’s looking at me like “” i can tell he was thinking i don’t live in the building he thinks i just wandered in off the streets and sat in the courtyard i can tell he’s thinking of coming over and dealing with me on his own and i’m sitting there thinking like “please do that yes please come on come on come on come on come on” and i’m trying to look even more gross and i’m like pulling up my shirt “” and then i see him go “no that’s not gonna do at all” and he comes over to me “” and i’m like “num num num” i’m so excited to have this thing a confrontation where i’m not wrong at all and he thinks i am “rrgh” so he comes over says “excuse me “do you live in this building” and i said “no” ’cause why not start there i said “no” he goes “well then what are you doing here” and i said “i just need to rest i’m having a hard time” he says “this is private property” and i said “well i don’t really believe in that” you know just the worst things i could say from his point of view is basically all the things i was saying and he goes “well if you don’t leave i’m gonna talk to the doorman” i was like “can i just stay like five more hours” so he’s–“no” and he goes over to the doorman and i see him talking about me to the doorman like this and then i see the doorman going “no that guy lives here it’s ok” and the look on his face– mwah mwah num num– it was just so– it was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion it’s like i had invented a new way to hurt somebody’s feelings that’s how excited i was “getting what ‘old’ is”\n",

            "it’s a weird selection process that we have dating really is– it’s how we evolve is dating it’s how we choose each other and dating is a real drag for a lot of people but i always think it’s a nice thing you know when i see a date i’m always happy when i see a couple on a date ’cause it means people are still trying you know you see a couple on a date it means there’s still courage out there that takes courage to go on a date for both sides two very different kinds of courage the male courage traditionally speaking is that he decided to ask he went up to a random woman who he has no idea if she’s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified everything in your body is telling you “just go the fuck home and jerk off don’t do this” but he walked up and said “hi yes” and she’s like “” “no no no a second give me a second” and you try to get through this membrane of you know– and then if it works and you say “you wanna go out sometime” sometimes she’ll say yes and if she says yes that’s her courage and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything i can imagine a woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and illadvised and the whole species’ existence counts on them doing it and i don’t know how they– how do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men we’re the numberone threat to women globally and historically we’re the numberone cause of injury and mayhem to women we’re the worst thing that ever happens to them that’s true you know what our numberone threat is heart disease that’s the whole thing that’s it just our own heart going “dude i can’t– “you can’t keep doing this i told you three strokes ago that this is not smart” but women still– “yeah i’ll go out with you alone at night” what are you nuts “i’ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders hi where are we going” “to your death statistically” how do they still do it if you’re a guy try to imagine that you could only date a halfbear halflion and you’re like “i hope this one’s nice i hope he doesn’t do what he’s going to do” “first date”\n",
            "i always– i love when i see a date you know when you see a date you can tell it’s the first date ’cause of the way they’re walking together and she’s looking up at his face trying to figure him out and he’s just a mess a guy on a first date just has no actual personality he’s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each just anything no cohesive– just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines just you know “well… “ha ha “well yes i think so too ha ha rrgh…” whatever just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions hoping to find pay dirt at someplace and then sometimes you see a date that’s later down the line and something has happened there’s something that happens in a date that i never get to witness ’cause women do this they get to do it inside they get to just decide quietly “i’m gonna let him fuck me” they just get to decide something he says and she’s like “that was good he’s gonna fuck me later” and he has no idea he’s still like trying all this shit he still has no idea he’s already in there “tits”\n",

            "it’s pretty good and i’ve wasted a lot of time just being angry at people i don’t know you know it’s amazing how nasty we can get as people depending on the situation like most people are ok as long as they’re ok but if you put people in certain contexts they just change like when i’m in my car i have a different set of values i am the worst person i can be when i’m behind the wheel which is when i’m at my most dangerous when you’re driving that’s when you need to be the most compassionate and responsible of any other time in your life ’cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons and yet it’s the worst people get and i am the worst one time i was driving and there was a guy ahead of me and he kind of–i don’t know– sorta drifted into my lane for a second and this came out of my mouth i said “worthless piece of shit” i mean what an indictment what kind of a way is that to feel about another human being “worthless piece of shit” that’s somebody’s son and things i’ve said to other people i was once driving and some guy in a pickup truck did– i don’t remember even– and i yelled out my window i said “hey fuck you” where outside of a car is that even nearly ok if you were in an elevator and you were like right next to a person’s body and whatever like he leaned into you a little bit would you ever turn right to their face and go “hey fuck you” “worthless piece of shit” no literally zero people would ever do that but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you there’s nothing you would not say to them “i hope you die” i said that to a person “i hope you die” why ’cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life you tested my reflexes and it worked out fine so now i hope your kids grow up motherless” i mean what am i capable of i’d like to think that i’m a nice person but i don’t know man “if murder was legal”\n",
            "a lot of it is context there’s a lot of things i wonder if the world was different like if murder was legal i might have killed a few people i don’t know i’d love to think “i would never do that” but we really need the law against murder for one simple reason the law against murder is the numberone thing preventing murder we’d like to think it’s ’cause like “i would never do that” no it’s ’cause it really sucks getting caught murdering a lot if murder was legal or just a misdemeanor– like you get a thing in the mail– “shit they had a camera there well” if murder was legal there would be so much murder regular people would murder murderers would murder even more and then really nice sweet people would murder a few people but nobody would murder no people you wouldn’t trust somebody who didn’t murder if murder was legal you wouldn’t like them “i never killed anybody” “ok nice meeting you yecch what a creep “i mean not even a hooker live a life “what’s wrong with that guy he’s like a mormon or some shit i hate those guys” “i think he’s nice” “shut up janet” they would just– if murder was legal there would be a lot of murder children would behave very differently because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids that’s mostly what would happen if murder was legal you know you’d go to a mall there’d be like eight different moms in the mall just– “i told you to stop it you didn’t listen to me” just–pbbt there’d be just– you’d be stepping over dead kids there’d be like a new problem “you have to clean up your kids “when you kill them ’cause it’s gross “it’s bad for the environment “if you murder your child in a public place “please use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers “every three feet of america “put your murdered child in the red bag “with a logo of a murdered kid on it “next to the other logo that tells you “not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag “because they might suffocate in which case you could just leave them in the bag” that is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts right in a row right in a row that is a compressed area of bad thought “of course but maybe”\n",
            "you know you have your bad thoughts hopefully you do good things everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts hopefully the good thoughts win for me i always have both i have like the thing i believe the good thing– that’s the thing i believe– and then there’s this thing and i don’t believe it but it is there it’s always this thing and then this thing it’s become a category in my brain that i call “of course… but maybe…” i’ll give you an example ok like of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected of course we have to segregate their food from nuts have their medication available at all times and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies of course but maybe… maybe if touching a nut kills you you’re supposed to die of course not of course not of course not jesus i have a nephew who has that i’d be devastated if something happened to him but maybe… maybe if we all just do this for one year we’re done with nut allergies forever no of course not of course if you’re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt it’s a terrible tragedy of course of course… but maybe… maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot it’s not that weird maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at it’s a tiny bit your fault of course of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened listen listen you all clapped for dead kids with the nuts for kids dying from nuts you applauded so you’re in this with me now do you understand you don’t get to cherrypick those kids did nothing to you of course of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened of course it is every time it’s happened– black people in america jews in egypt every time a whole race of people has been enslaved it’s a terrible horrible thing of course… but maybe… maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves every single thing where you go “how did they build those pyramids” they just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished how did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly we just threw chinese people in caves and blew ’em up and didn’t give a shit what happened to them there’s no end to what you can do when you don’t give a fuck about particular people you can do anything that’s where human greatness comes from is that we’re shitty people that we fuck others over even today how do we have this amazing microtechnology because the factory where they’re making these they jump off the fucking roof ’cause it’s a nightmare in there you really have a choice you can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away just so you can leave a mean comment on youtube while you’re taking a shit thanks a lot folks you guys were great thank you very very much thank you your email address will not be published required fields are marked  \n",

            "wow. hey, thank you. thanks. thank you, guys. hey, seattle. nice to see you. look at this. look at us. we’re here. this is crazy. it’s insane. so about five years ago, pretty much everyone who i know started to get married, and that was strange for me because i don’t really believe in the idea of marriage. and that would have been fine, except i have a problem where sometimes when i think that i am right about something, it can be a real source of tension between me and the person i’m arguing with. and the reason it’s a source of tension is that i’m right. and so i remember distinctly talking to my friend dana, and she goes, “well, you don’t believe in marriage for you, but, of course, you believe in it for other people.” and i was like, “no, i think it’s insane, you know, for anyone.” and she said, “why?”\n",
            "and i said, “well, first of all, it just seems doomed.” you know, 50% of marriages end in divorce. that’s just first marriages, by the way. second marriages, 60% to 62% end in divorce. third marriages, 70% to 75% end in divorce. that’s a learning curve.\n",
            "second of all, monogamy’s impossible, or at the very least, not a sure thing. when i say that, i think people assume that i’m implying that men are incapable of being faithful. i think women are just as incapable, but for more sophisticated reasons, you know. i mean, with men, we’re just really simple. we have a very simple sexuality. when i say that, my female friends are like, “well, we like sex just as much as you do.” and i said, “sure, but it’s different.” and they say, “how?” and i say, “have you ever masturbated while driving a car?”\n",
            "number three… i’m never gonna be happy. why would anyone want to be a part of that? i think that’s not brought up often enough. i, um, i didn’t know that would be the reaction. oh, no, that’s the hopeful part. the, uh… i had one ally in all this, which is my friend andy, and he’s a comedian as well. not only did we decide we weren’t gonna get married, we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married. yeah, we were pretty good at it. like, we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages, you know. we were… we were pretty good. i mean, we weren’t like the best in the world. i’m sure there are better in europe. but we were… we were solid, you know. like, so, like, for example, at point my friend alex was about to get engaged. and so we just took him to dinner. and during dessert, we gave him a long, hard stare. we said, “are you sure this is what you want to do?” and then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we weren’t friends anymore. so february 27, 2007, i’m at andy’s house in los angeles. and earlier in the night, i got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone, and it was a bad one because i knew that i was right. and andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation ’cause he’s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether you’re right. he says stuff like, “she sounds crazy.” like, even if what she’s saying isn’t that crazy, like, you’d be like, “she only eats whole wheat bagels.” he’d be like, “she sounds crazy!” you’d be like, “that’s not even the crazy part!” you know. so i’m telling him about his argument. and he goes, “you’re right.” i go, “i know. i’m right.” he goes, “yeah, you’re right.” i go, “i know i’m right. i got to tell her about this in the morning.” and i get in my rental car to head back to my hotel, and i’m driving out of andy’s small road, and i’m t-boned! i don’t know if you’re familiar with this term, uh… this is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driver’s side at a 90-degree angle, like a t-bone steak. and in 1 1/2 seconds, i’m spun around, and i think i’m dead. no, wait, i’m paralyzed. and then i hear nothing. and then i hear the other car skid out and drive away. i know. let me tell you how this argument started. i met jenny in st. louis. my friend andy and i were working for her company. they were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches, which is really my demographic. i, uh… no, i was very nervous about this. i was actually kind of about to go onstage, and i was, like, scrawling notes on my napkin. a lot of times i’ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary. and jenny looked at me, and she goes, “what are you doing?” and i said, “i’m writing my set list.” and then she goes, “i think it’ll be fine.” and i was like, “no, it won’t be fine.” and then she was like, “i think it will be okay.” and i said, “why do you think that?” and she said, “well, you look so nervous, i think they’ll feel sorry for you.” but jenny has this really soft, sweet voice, like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything. at one point, she said, “it seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage.” normally, i’d be offended by that, but in this instance, i was like, “you are right. that is a great point. you are beautiful, you know.” she re… she really was. you know, from the moment i met jenny, i knew i wanted to sleep with her at least once. stay with me. uh, i mean… i mean that in, like, in the most meaningful way. like, that was the most that i was capable of in my life at that point. i… i’d jus… i’d just come off a really long, difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married, and… and then we weren’t. and then when we weren’t, i was so heartbroken, i just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely, you know, and… but from the moment i met jenny, i just wanted to be with her. and i didn’t… i didn’t think it was gonna happen. like, i don’t have that kind of confidence. i actually think of myself as a sex maybe, which is to say that if i’m seeing a girl, she’d think, “i’d have sex with him, maybe.” you know, and i’m… i’m not ashamed of that. there were periods in my life where i was a sex never. or a sex with self always. yeah. and often. surprisingly often. yeah, i just don’t give off a great first impression. like, i’ll give you an example. like, this is the shirt i decided to wear tonight. like, i didn’t… i didn’t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt. i mean, this is my “a” outfit. my “b” outfit was naked. i like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that i might be a fixer-upper. i’ve reached this point in my life i don’t really look in the mirror before i leave my apartment. i glance at it to make sure i’m not bleeding. you know what i mean? like… but i don’t stare at the mirror. if i stare at the mirror, i get angry. like, i feel like i’m complaining about a bad call a ref just made. i’m like, “come on!” “you’re blind if you’re leaving the house like that!” and the ref is god, and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline. and it’s a close game ’cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast, and i’m all riled up. i’m about to charge the field. and the guy comes by with fried dough. and i’m like, “next time.” you know, that’s how i go for fried dough, ’cause i have a problem. i just… this is ridiculous. can you follow me over here for a second? i’m gonna jump off stage. this is only in seattle where someone is wearing no shoes? no shoes or socks? what? who are you people? what is wrong with you? i would expect that behavior from this guy, but not you, sir, not you! what is this? where do you think you are? from seattle! yeah, seattle. so i’ve been going, uh, recently to a women’s exercise class. i-i’ve given up on having a traditional male physique. and so now i’m going for strong, independent woman. and, uh… it’s going pretty well, you know. i’m not as good in the class as you might think. sometimes i’ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isn’t looking. but then when she looks over, i always have to strike a pose as though i’ve been doing what everybody else has been doing. it reminds me of the olympics. you know how they do gymnastics, how they’ll have those… the girls will do those crazy flips and twirls. and every once in a while… and i’m not saying i root for this to happen, but sometimes they’ll fall, and it’s ugly ’cause they’re rolling around like, “i’m in a lot of trouble. like, i don’t even know how i got here.” but at the end of that, no matter what… and i totally fall for it. i’m like, “that can’t possibly be the same loser “from moments ago. “i mean, that’s a completely different person. “this person has much better posture, for starters.” i really wanted jenny to come out with me and andy that night in st. louis ’cause we were going out to one of these famous irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak. and so i thought that might work to my advantage. i don’t know, and, uh… i didn’t have the nerve to ask her myself, and so i convinced andy to ask her for us. and, uh… pfft. which… yeah, i don’t know if that was the best idea ’cause, uh, we’re heading… we’re in the car heading to the pub, and jenny says, “oh, i left my i.d. at the hotel.” and i was like, “oh, we can just swing back and get it.” and she’s like… she’s like, “no, it’ll be fine.” i was like, “no, it won’t be fine ’cause it’s st. patrick’s day, and there’s bouncers.” and she goes, “no, it’ll be okay.” and i was like, “no, it won’t be okay.” and then we get to the pub, and it was fine. like, the bouncer just kind of waved her through, which has not been my experience with bouncers. for me, bouncers are like prison guards. and for jenny, they’re like birthday clowns like, you know, “what can i do to make your day better?”\n",
            "you know, and that’s… we’re at the pub, and it had taken so much convincing for andy to get jenny to come out there. by the time she came out, she thought she was on a date with him. and, yeah, that wasn’t the idea. and so i said… i had to convince him to fall away as the night went on, like the red rockets on the space shuttle. and eventually, she realized she was on a date with me, and she was not happy about that. but, uh… but she warmed to me as the night went on ’cause she was drinking, and then, like… no, by the end of the night, we were laughing and having a good time, and we… i caught a break, which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends, and she and i were stuffed in this little back seat together. and it was really quiet, so i could hear her soft voice. and she told me she had just come off a long, difficult breakup, and i told her about my breakup. and for a moment there in the back seat, it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart, and… we get back to the hotel, and i offer to walk her to her room, and she says, “sure.” we get to her door, and i didn’t want this night to end. and so i build up the courage to lean in to kiss her, and she says, “oh, no, thank you.” which i thought was polite… but disappointing. i mean, there’s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because you’re really putting yourself out there. you’re just like, “i think we should connect mouths,” you know, and… the other person’s like, “i do not think we should connect mouths.” and those are… they’re two very different mouth agendas, you know. and then you just feel so stupid. you’re like, “i never should have suggested we connect mouths, you know.” this is a sore subject for me. i have sort of a long history of failed kisses. like, i… i remember growing up, like, when people started making out. like, in my time in massachusetts, it was in seventh grade. i remember… i remember it like it was yesterday ’cause i was shocked. i was like, “people we know are just making out with other people we know?” “but how?” you know. it seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden. i was like, “i am not doing that.” and collectively, all the girls in my class were like, “that is fine. “you are not on the list. “you’re not exactly a first-round draft pick for our new activity.” i was like, “perfect.” it seemed so gross to me. and it still does kind of. like, sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like, “i don’t like when i see two dudes making out in the street.” and i feel that way about anyone. like, making out is just sloppy. it’s like watching a dog eat spaghetti. that’s how i make out. is that right? does anybody know if that’s right? okay, good. so… in seventh grade, i was like, “i’m not gonna make out with anybody.” and that was fine for a while, but increasingly, it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts. it was like, the make-out club and the non-make-out club. and these were informal organizations, of course. i mean, i would be sad if that were school-sanctioned, like, “we call this meeting of the non-make-out club to order. “first order of business, nintendo. “second order of business, why doesn’t anyone like us? meeting adjourned.” i don’t know, it was a sad group, and we were losing good guys by the day. i feared… i feared that soon i would be the lone member of the non-make-out club, so i was like, “i got to try to get into the make-out club.” but it was a very intangible goal. i didn’t really talk to a lot of girls, and… there was one girl who sat in front of me in class named lisa bazetti who i had a huge crush on, but she was way out of my league. like, she had many suitors. she had… i don’t… the rest of the show is in old english. uh… she doth had many suitors! uh, no, she had many, you know, admirers. and there were three of us, really, and i was in third place in all the trade publications, but i had one advantage over these other guys, which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework, thanks to alphabetical order. bazetti, birbiglia. one time i said something on the phone that made her laugh, and i was like, “oh, this is great. i got to do that more.” and one time we were on the phone, and she was laughing so hard, i remember so well ’cause she goes, “mike, you got to stop. i’m gonna pee myself.” and i was like, “wow.” this was the closest i’d ever come to a vagina. so spent the next 15 years trying to get lisa bazetti to pee. and that’s how i ended up here. yeah. that’s how we all ended up here, in a sense. so… uh… so here’s what happened with lisa. one time i built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me, and she said yes. i couldn’t believe it. like, all of a sudden i thought, “well, maybe this will be like “one of those romantic comedy montages. “we’ll go to the carnival, we’ll get stuck “on the top of the ferris wheel, we’ll make out. “it’ll all take a minute and a half, and it will be set to phil collins song.” but i think that when you’re 12 years old, you just don’t understand certain things about your digestive system. you don’t know that you shouldn’t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler. cotton candy being the most insane of these items. it’s basically saying, “we’re gonna take sugar, “which everyone knows is bad, but then we’ll dress it up like insulation.” and i’m like, “i’m not sure “what the selling point is there. is it the sugar or the insulation?” they’re like, “we already sold it.” i’m like, “well done, way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates.” i don’t know if you have the scrambler here in seattle. i imagine you might. it travels on a truck. it is a very mobile scrambling unit. the premise is very simple. you just sit on a two-person pod with the person you are in love with, and that pod goes in a circle, which is part of a larger circle, which is part of an even grander circle. as i understand it, it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients. it was called the “shits of pants-erator,” and it was wildly successful. and then it was co-opted by the carnival workers of america. cwoa. and they said… they said, “we like it, but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff.” and then one guy says, “well, what about the ‘i think i’m gonna die-erator’?” and they’re like, “that’s good, “’cause it gets across the essence of how you feel “when you’re on the machine. “plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea, “which is a nice homage “to the original intention of the machine, “but we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff.” and then one guy goes, “well, what about the scrambler? ‘cause it scrambles you!” they’re like, “we get it, frank, but who…” frank is a maniac. this guy can’t be stopped, but every once in a while, he’s got a good idea. “but who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment?” and this one guy goes, “well, i have a nephew who’s 16 years old “and smokes pot 24 hours a day. i feel like he might be available.” and they’re like, “he sounds amazing. “we don’t even need to interview him. he sounds completely qualified.”\n",
            "i sit down with lisa on the scrambler, and i’m feeling good. like, she’s snuggling up close to me, and i’m thinking… i’m thinking like, “this could be it. “this could be where it’s all gonna happen. this is very special.” and then they put that bar seat belt down. and the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment. it’s not a ralph nader approved item. i don’t think it’s saved lives. i think the only thing it’s ever done is in a scrambler accident, it’s just sort of held someone’s esophagus down to the pavement, making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident. first rule of scrambler accident, don’t talk about scrambler accident. that’s from scrambler club. well, i knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that i was going to throw up for sure. and i even said to the 16-year-old stoner, i was like, “hey, actually…” and then he was gone. apparently, he doesn’t enjoy the second halves of sentences.\n",
            "so then i’m scrambling, and… as i am scrambling, i’m thinking, “i need to come up with a plan of some kind. i’m not going down without a fight.” my first plan was very simple. it was just don’t look at lisa, don’t look at any other people. i was like, “don’t look at lisa, “don’t look at any other people. “don’t look at lisa, “don’t look at any other people. i need a new plan.” and… the new plan was i needed to tell the scrambler operator… that he needed to stop the ride, but… the mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window. so i’m like, “i got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “i got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “i got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. please stop the ride!” and i’m back! “i’m not sure he heard me. “i got to say it louder. please stop the ride! “i’m not sure he’s paying attention. i think he might be smoking pot right now.” the third time i said, “please stop.” and then i started throwing up, and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler, just… popcorn, peanuts… insulation. really, insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa. i did not look at lisa. but i’m pretty sure she was staring at me because i was a spectacle at that point. i was spectacular. and we did not make out. i did not lose my mouth virginity that evening. two years later, it gets worse. um… i’m at the st. john’s high school, what they call a cattle call dance. this is an all boys catholic school i attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty st. john’s gymnasium like cattle, which is a friendly way to describe women, you know. so… cattle shows up at 8:00. we’ll make out with the cattle. cattle goes home at 10:00. then we go out for burgers. completely separate from the cattle analogy. it was a horrible affair. it was just like this room chock-full of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out. at this point, i was, indeed, the lone member of the non-make-out club, but it was actually worse than that ’cause i had to lie to my friends and tell them i had had my first kiss ’cause it was, like, this really tough, all boys school. and so when they would ask, like, “oh, have you had your first kiss?” i’d be like, “yeah, like, all the time. like, every… every week.” i always feared at some point there’d be a follow-up question like, “oh, yeah? what’s it like?” and i’d be like, “yeah, you know, it’s just like licking an ice cream cone.” and they’d be like, “no, it’s not. it’s like sucking on a rocket pop.” and i’d be like, “ah, wrong frozen dessert analogy.” i’m at the dance, and i’m flanked by my friend sam ricciardi. and we’re introduced by our friend tom to these girls from his town. they were the last two cows at the dance. they were like, “moo!” and we were like, “moo!” and then sam says one of these phrases i think we’ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat. he says, “you get that one.” which i know it’s the worst turn of phrase, but i’m comfortable saying it ’cause i know i’ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me, “you get that one.” and then her friend goes like, “oof.” you know, or even worse… or even worse, like, “you owe me,” which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance. i would hate to hurt someone’s credit score, you know. so he goes… he goes, “you get that one.” and then i’m just fast dancing with this girl, sandra, to young mc’s bust a move. and i’m not great at fast dancing, but they had the strobe light going, so it’s only catching me one out of every five… hey! so she’s losing interest, but at 1/5 the speed. and then i’m saved by a slow song, stairway to heaven, which is a classic make-out anthem. led zeppelin, eight minutes long. what’s great about slow dancing is you can’t really mess it up ’cause it’s just sort of a slow-motion hug. like, the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it. she’d be like, “what are you doing?” and i’d be like, “i don’t pick up on social cues,” you know. but it’s such a long song, you know, stairway, so i’m just trying not to fidget. i’m sort of a fidgety person. i feared if i fidgeted too much, i might initiate the head tilt too early. i didn’t know anything about making out, but i’d seen people do it. i could see there’s, like, a head tilt. i had heard there were tongues involved. and i could see that there was, like, some kind of space in between the two mouths. to me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing. what is happening in that space? there is no… you know, there’s no video documentation of that area. it’s like the giant squid of making out. no one has seen it alive. they’ve only seen it washed up on the shore… which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy, but… so i’m trying not to fidget. then with 1 1/2 minutes left in stairway to heaven, the song hits that crescendo… all around me, kids start to make the tilt. just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me. and i was like, “oh, no. i don’t want to be alone anymore.” and i make the slightest tilt. and then sandra comes in strong, and then it’s an all-out mouth war. and she had artillery ’cause she had braces. it was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork. as this oral atrocity is taking place, all i can think is, “i’m not alone anymore! i’m not in the non-make-out club!” and all i wanted to do was tell my friends, but i couldn’t because up until that point, i’d lied and said that i’d had my first kiss. i walked off the dance floor, sam was like, “how’d it go, dude?” i had to be like, “same as always. pretty smooth.” as the week wore on, i started to convince myself, “well, maybe it did go well, “and i should call sandra, and this could bud into a relationship of some kind,” but… i got her number from tom, and those conversations ended up being very brief, you know. we didn’t have a lot to talk about. i remember just being like, “hey, you like full house? “me neither. cool. all right. later.” you know what i mean? at certain points, i remember getting this vibe from her, kind of like, “why are you calling me?” and i remember thinking, “oh, i’m probably reading into that one too much,” and… and then she stopped calling me back. and i was like, “oh, yeah, i read into that one perfectly.” but i just felt so dumb about the whole thing, and the worst part is i couldn’t even tell my friends, until one day i was… i was standing by my locker with my friend tom, and so i said to him, i was like, “hey, what’s going on with sandra? like, she hasn’t called me back.” and tom has this knowing grin on his face. i was like, “what?” tom was like, “nothing.” and i was like, “what?” tom was like, “nothing.” and i was like, “what?” tom’s like, “oh.” “i talked to sandra, and she said “you’re the worst kisser she’s ever kissed.” and it was so devastating ’cause not only was it probably true, but i couldn’t explain to my friends why it was true. i couldn’t say, “that makes sense. i’ve never done that before.” so instead i had to play it off. i had to be like, “yeah, that sounds about right. “i’m a terrible kisser. that’s kind of my thing.” so i lean in to kiss jenny, and she says, “oh, no, thank you.” she agrees to go out with me in new york. we were both living in new york, and she gave me her number, and i typed it in my phone, and from that point on, she would be “jen, irish pub, nice.” a few weeks later, i took her out to a restaurant i couldn’t afford to show her how much money i could put on my credit card. we’re out to dinner, and she says to me, she goes, “everyone hates me at work,” and i said, “why would they hate you? i love you.” she goes, “you love me?” i go, “i mean, you seem cool.” i pulled it back. i didn’t want to show all my cards. just about nine of them. one of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said, “you know, sometimes i’ll date two people at once, and that way i’m never let down by either person.” i said, “that seems like a really smart plan. like, i’d like to do that as well.” and she said, “i’m still kind of seeing my ex-boyfriend, john, and you can see other people too, but you have to tell me if you’re seeing them.” and i was like, “all right, sounds like a plan. “got it. break! i got to go find some more people, you know.” and so a few nights later, i’m in another city, and i do a show, and after the show, i went out to a bar, and i ended up making out with this random girl. then a few nights later, i’m out to dinner with jenny, and she says, “how was your trip?” and i said, “it was great. i did some shows, “and then one night i ended up making out with this random girl.” and that didn’t go over very well in the conversation. i could sense that something was wrong. and i was like, “but i’m right about that, right? like, i’m supposed to tell you if that happens, right?” and she says, “yeah, but it doesn’t mean “that i won’t lose interest in you.” and i said, “that’s a whole new clause! “that’s a twist! what is this, the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects?” i said, “are you still seeing john?” and she said, “sometimes.” i said, “well, don’t you see the contradiction in that?” and she says, “yes.” and it gets very quiet… because we were falling in love. three weeks into my relationship with jenny, i built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to bermuda. i wanted to show her how much more money i could put on my credit card. since i didn’t have a lot left, we went to bermuda ’cause it was the off season. you can get these great deals online. because as it turns out, when it’s winter in new york, it is also winter… in bermuda, and, uh… jenny and i meet up at the airport, and she’s late, which is a big pet peeve of mine. i fancy myself as a professional traveler. i’m always two hours early, i have my pocket for my ticket and my passport, and i have laceless moccasins. i never tell jokes about bombs. and… and jenny’s late. and then we get to security, and i’m not making this up, she doesn’t have a license or a passport. and i said, “what do you mean?” i go, “how do you travel?” and she goes, “well, “usually, they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work i.d.” i don’t like to dwell on the differences between men and women, but i just can’t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport, and they would let him on the plane. but women get a pass on things like this that i find completely bewildering. i mean, if i were in charge of al-qaeda, for example, what… what i would do is i would recruit attractive women because they’re just not stopped under any circumstances. although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the 72 virgins and, you know, the women wouldn’t want that, unless they’re lesbians, although there’s an idea, you know. al-qaeda… al-qaeda could recruit hot lesbians, although… then they’d have to guarantee that the 72 virgins are also lesbians. i mean, what are the odds, you know? all 72 virgins are also lesbians, unless you think of sexuality as, like, a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity. like the 72 virgins are like, “i didn’t even know i was a lesbian “until i had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist. “and now that’s all i’m into. “i used to be into these afghani guys who are so crazy, “they’d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me “and 71 of my friends. but now i don’t see khalid in the same way anymore.” the point is, we went to bermuda, and we’re on the flight… on the flight, and the flight attendant comes over, and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us. and she says, “congratulations on your honeymoon.” and we said, “oh, no, thanks. we’re not on our honeymoon.” and she walks away, and jenny says, “that’s so funny. i don’t think i’ll ever go on a honeymoon.” and i said, “oh, really?” and she goes, “yeah. i don’t think i’d ever want to get married in my life.” and i said, “oh, really?” i go, “me too.” i said, “is that based on a principle, “or did you have a bad relationship? like, what was your first boyfriend like?” and… she told me about her first boyfriend brian. it was… they were at the same bus stop when they were 16, and they would make out on the bus, and they were together for six years. and they… you know, their relationship got deeper, and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together. and i said, “then what?” and she said, “he died. he had leukemia.” and i said, “well, do you ever talk about this with anyone?” and she says, “no, i don’t really like to talk about it.” but these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where jenny was opening up to me, and i was opening up to her. and every night we’d be up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and we were so happy, we… at one point, i was like, “well, we should do this again. “we should go on another trip. and you could get a license or a passport.” jenny said, “that sounds great, “but i don’t think i’d get a license or a passport ’cause they don’t make me get one.” and i was like, “yeah, but it’s the law.” you know. jenny says, “yeah, i don’t think i’ll get one “’cause they don’t make me get one, you know. that’s how i feel.” that’s how jenny argues things. sometimes she’ll just say, “that’s how i feel.” and i’ll say, “that’s not an argument.” “like, we’re not even in an argument right now because you don’t have an argument.” and she’ll say, “i just won that argument.” and i’ll say, “that’s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is.” and she’ll say, “i just won that argument,” again. “that’s how i feel.” you could see how this could be a little bit maddening, you know, uh… on our final day on the trip, we got into an argument about essentially nothing. she noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel, and she said, “we should play.” and i was like, “yeah, but not, like, a game.” and she said, “why?” and i said, “well, ’cause i’d win.” and she said, “no, i think i would win.” i go, “no. i know that i’d win, “and i know that what i’m supposed to say is that… “the guy says, ‘i’ll win,’ the girl says, ‘i’ll win,’ “and the guy lets her win, and then she likes him more. but i just don’t have that in me.” and jenny goes, “you don’t have to let me win. let’s go out and play.” and so we went out and played basketball, and i just kicked her ass. i mean, it was just like… it was just like… 10 to 1, you know, 11 to 1. i mean, i was having a good day, but still, i was just destroying her. and at one point, she literally said, “i’ve never met someone who’s so obsessed with the score.” and i said, “the score is what makes it a game!” so we’re arguing this over lunch, and then, again, it comes up at dinner, and then we’re still arguing about it at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning about essentially nothing. and she said, “i don’t understand why you’re so obsessed with being right.” i go, “i’m not obsessed with it. i just am.” i said, “why do you think you’re right?” and she says, “that’s how i feel.” i said, “if you think i’m so wrong about everything, why are you even with me?” and jenny says, “you can’t choose who you love.” which is true, but it doesn’t mean it’s good. i remember the first time i fell in love, i was in high school, and it was that first time where you fall in love, and you’re just like, “this is it. i found her. i’m 17 years old, and i’m done, you know.” and… her name was amanda, and she was, like, adorable and funny. and what was really exciting for me was that she was, like, a delinquent. like, i was like this play-by-the-rules school citizen, and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid, which i thought was a really strong quality. like, at one point, she was like, “it was totally messed up because it wasn’t even me. it was this other girl, and i was framed.” and i was just like, “awesome.” like no one would ever frame me for anything. i just… i thought it was like an opposites attract situation. she wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper. and i wanted to know what it was like to be cool. at one point, i was like, “do you want to write an article for the newspaper?” she goes, “i don’t want to write an article. i want to do things people write articles about.” and i was like, “good answer.”\n",
            "i find that when you fall in love, you tend to overlook certain red flags. one of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me, but then she would pull it back. she’d be like, “no one likes you at all. only kidding.” or, like, “you’re like a nerd, but you’re not even smart. just joking.” can’t choose who you love.\n",
            "second red flag with amanda was that she was a liar. and i don’t… i don’t mean that in an offensive way. like, lying was kind of like a… it’s like a sport at the school i was at. i transferred from the all boys school to this co-ed school. there was this one guy in my class named keith robbins who was a legendary liar. you’d know when he was lying ’cause he would lick his finger like a bookie, and he would dart his eyes from side to side. and he’d go, “yeah, yeah, nice. nice, you know.” and he wasn’t even handling money. like, i don’t even know what this is about. and then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant. he’d be like, “yeah, my uncle’s tony robbins, “motivational speaker. yeah, nice, you know.” and… we found out that that wasn’t even true. but even if that were true, that wouldn’t be impressive to a bunch of high school students. but i think that’s the jedi level of lying, is you lie about little stuff, and no one notices when you’re lying about big stuff. it’s like banking.\n",
            "the final red flag with amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend. i know. i’m in the future also. i think we can all see now ’cause we’re so smart, and mike’s so dumb, and, uh… you know, i can also see, in retrospect, that’s a much bigger red flag than i perceived it to be at the time, but i was so excited she was even with me at all. and she said she had another boyfriend at home, but they were in the process of breaking up, but it was a bad time ’cause his parents were sick. and so i tried to be understanding of that. you know, i went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents. and i thought, “well, this is the affirmation that i need. i’m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend.” and i drive my mom’s station wagon to amanda’s parents’ house, and i walk in the front door, and there’s amanda, and there’s her parents, and it’s going well. and a few hours go by, and this other guy comes over to the house, and his name is scott. i’m assuming he’s, like, a family friend or a relative. and slowly i’m noticing similarities between scott and things that amanda has said about her other boyfriend. they’re both in their first year in college, and they’re competitive wrestlers, and… it’s dawning on me that i’m hanging out with my girlfriend’s boyfriend. and it’s going pretty well. i mean, he… he seemed like a nice guy. i could totally see what she saw in him. there was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom, she would hold on to my hand, and she would say, “i wish it were just you and me here.” and i remember thinking, “you could make that happen.” the way she said it was as though she weren’t involved in the decision process, like, “i’d love to, but the boys in corporate…”\n",
            "well, the day took an even stranger turn when scott suggested that we go hang out at his house. and i met his parents. it is indescribable meeting your girlfriend’s boyfriend’s parents for the first time. part of you is angry for obvious reasons, but then part of you still wants to make a good impression. you know, you’re like… “maybe if this goes well, she’ll see that i’m good with adults in general!” as a side note, his parents seemed in perfect health. at one point, his dad even said to me, “how do you know amanda?” and i said, “we’re just friends from school.” and i was so ashamed, and i felt so dumb. and i drove home, and i remember thinking, “i am never gonna let this happen to me again.” so… ten months into my relationship with jenny, she invites me to meet her parents. and this was a tricky time. at this point, our relationship was intense, but casual, which is a dangerous relationship cocktail, and it was a hard thing to organize ’cause i was away probably five days out of the week. and so we found a sunday where i was coming back from a five-day stint in texas, which was awful ’cause it was… in texas. and i… that’s… that’s not to say i dislike texas entirely. it’s such a large thing to dislike. and, uh… but that week it felt like texas just disliked me, and i just kind of disliked texas back to the point where i developed a small drinking problem, which is… which is very popular in texas. i was performing at a comedy club. now, comedy… i love comedy clubs ’cause they’re sort of a high-low entertainment proposition. like, in some ways, though, they’re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word, and then some of them sell dildo straws, you know. like, there’s 15 bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends, and they’re handing out gummy penises or whatever. that’s… that’s actually a thing. i didn’t even realize that… i didn’t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was… was the gummy quality of the penis. i feel like if i were in charge of the candification of the penis, it would be hard candy. and then if… and then, if you suck it down to the gummy part, then you just sort of put that off to the side. but i… but that’s… that’s not my job. i’m… you know, i leave that to the experts, but i just… i just do the comedy part. but i was performing at this club all week, and after the late show saturday night, i was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things. and… i’d been drinking all week, and, uh, i always try to be a team player, you know. so i was like, “whatever i can do to help. i don’t see how this could end badly.” and, uh… the next morning, i wake up in the my hotel room, and i’m hung over, and i’m groggy. and i roll out of bed, and i run to the airport to catch my flight. i’m still two hours early, and… i land in new york, and i get a cab to jenny’s parents’ house. and i walk in the front door, and there’s jenny, and there’s her parents. and there’s her other sort of ex-boyfriend, john. and he wasn’t front and center. like, he was just kind of around, like, he was in the pool, like, wading and doing laps, like, that kind of thing. but i pulled jenny aside, i was like, “well, what’s john doing here?” and she says, “well, he and i aren’t still together, “but when we were together, “he became friends with my stepdad, “and he’s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks.” and i said, “you know, that’s not good. i feel like that gives him the edge.” jenny’s staring at me. and i said, “what?” she says, “you have a hickey on your neck.” and i said, “i don’t think that’s true.” and then i glance at the mirror next to me and realize that, in fact, i do have a hickey on my neck. and i say, “i’m really sorry.” and she says, “where is that from?” and i said, “there was this bachelorette party, and i was drunk.” that sentence never comes out right. i mean, there’s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay, and… we start arguing, and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment. i didn’t have a leg to stand on. i was like, “well, what about john? what was he doing there?” she said, “you have a hickey on your neck.” i said, “yeah, but at least i told you the truth.” and she said, “eventually.” and i said, “eventually is better than never!” and then she kneed me in the balls. i don’t know if you’ve ever experienced this before. i’m sure half of you have not. uh… it’s like being electrocuted, except you don’t get to die. it’s like you want to die, but you can’t. and there’s a person in your face saying, “you deserve this,” which they wouldn’t even do in electrocutions. i think they would deem that as inhumane.  even in texas.\n",
            "jenny says, “i think that we should just break up. “you know, it’s not just this. “i mean, you’re away a lot of the time. “and even when you’re here, you work at night, “and i work in the day. i just don’t think it’s gonna work out.” and i said, “okay.”  and we were apart for about six months, and i missed her so much, but i kept resisting calling her ’cause i wanted to give her space. and every once in a while i’d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from “jen, irish pub, nice.” and it would just say, “hi.” and i’d write back, “hi.” it was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another, but i think, in some ways, kept us together. and finally, on new year’s, i caved in, and i called her, i said, “hey, i really miss you, and i want to see you.” and we got together for coffee. and we hit it off just like we used to, and we decided we would get back together. we had a great period there, you know. i took her to get a license and a passport. first, we went for her social security card, and then we took that to the d.m.v. and then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport. it was like the triple crown of identifications. jenny was wildly identifiable. one night, she was heading back from my apartment to hers, and she stops. and i said, “what?” and she says, “i think that we should live together.” and i said, “no, i really don’t think that’s a good idea. “you know, i’ve just decided, you know, as a principle, “i’m not gonna get married or live with someone. it’s not personal.” and she said, “well, unless we live together, “i just don’t think it’s gonna work out “’cause we just don’t see each other enough, “and i don’t think that we stand a chance. that’s how i feel.” so we moved in together. and one day, jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends, and she invites me to come along. and i said, “oh, no, thanks.” that doesn’t go over so well. she says, “why?” and i said, “well, as you know, “i don’t believe in marriage, and so i don’t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it.” she said, “well, what do you believe in?” and i said, “i don’t know.” she said, “well, if you don’t believe in anything, how can you not believe in marriage?” and i said, “well, first of all, “you know, it just doesn’t seem necessary. “i mean, is it… you know, “marriage is an archaic institution “invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property. “i don’t want to be a part of that. “second of all, i don’t even think we have “a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is. “i mean, one of me and andy’s friends “was about to get engaged, and we were skeptical, “and we said, ‘are you sure this is the person “you want to be with for the rest of your life?’ “and he goes, ‘yeah, i think so.’ “and we said, ‘well, what if she gets in a car accident, “and she’s disfigured? would you stay with her then?’ “and he said, ‘maybe’! “that is not an acceptable answer! “third of all, if i’m so in love, “why does it need to be written into a government contract? “and i’m not one of these like, “‘i don’t want government up in my business’ kind of people! “i think the government does a nice job “delivering the mail and suggesting i don’t eat poison, “but i just don’t understand why they need to be involved “in my personal relationships. “then finally, if marriage is religious, “shouldn’t i believe in the religion? “i’ve been to more weddings of my friends “where the people on the altar don’t believe “in the religion of the church they’ve invited us to! “some of them even go to classes with the priest “in advance, to more elaborately lie “about believing in a religion they don’t believe in “just to have a wedding in a fancy building! “that is insane! that’s how i feel!” so i explain this to jenny. and jenny says, “well, if you ever did want to get married, i would marry you.” and i said, “why? aren’t you listening to any of this?” and jenny says, “that’s how i feel.” at this point, it was 5:00 in the morning, we’d been arguing all night, and we hadn’t slept. i had to catch a flight at 6:20 a.m. out of newark airport to los angeles for a show i was doing that night. at this point, i’m overtired, and i’m angry, and i’m late. i’m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase. and i walk out of our apartment. it’s 5:00 a.m., that part of the morning before the earth even exists, before they program the matrix or whatever. you walk out of your apartment, part of the road isn’t even there. there’s a guy with a laptop going, “we need a road, stat! what’s the code for building, tank?” you know, and i get to the airport. the news hasn’t even started yet. it’s just an anchor looking around like, “what are you up to?” and i get to the kiosk, and i print up my ticket, and i bring it to the security lady, and she looks at me, and she goes, “well, that ain’t your gate.” like, i guess they changed the gate, but the way she said it was as though i had participated in the decision of changing it. i was like, “i was not involved in this process. i wasn’t even c.c.’d.” like, as though i had gone to the kiosk and been like, “b22. like hell i’m flying out of b22.” and then i photoshopped my own ticket, printed it out, and been like, “this is where i’m going.” you know, i’m not that aggressive as a traveler, so i was like, “well, where is this gate?” she goes, “it’s in another terminal. you got to take a tram.” she points to the tram, and i start walking my roller suitcase, and i hear her say, “and you better run.” like, i guess i was late at that point. so i started running. and the roller suitcase does not enjoy running. the roller suitcase was like, “i don’t want to run. i have wheels.” and i was like, “i don’t want to run either, but this is what we have to do. “i tell you what, when we get to the hotel, i’ll walk you in circles for a few hours.” then i… i get to the tram, and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives. and it says zero minutes. i was like, “perfect. that’s exactly how long i want to wait.” but the tram’s riding away. i was like, “that’s -1 minute!” then it says ten minutes, and i’m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like, “oh, great, i’m gonna miss my flight, “and then i’m gonna miss every flight from now on, “and i’m gonna miss my family reunion. “and then i’m not gonna have a family, and then i’m gonna be a crack whore.” and it’s like, all of a sudden, i’m a crack whore just because i miss this one flight. i can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and…\n",
            "i get on the next tram ten minutes later, and i run to the gate, and i’m sweaty, and i’m out of breath, but i’m on time. and i’m so relieved that i sit down in a chair at the gate, and i fall asleep. and i wake up to the sound of the door shutting. i jump up, and the door is closed, and i am on the sad side of the door. the happy side has an airplane and a pilot. the sad side is me and the cinnabon lady. normally, i’d be very excited if it were just me and the cinnabon lady. i’m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year. i think that’s an effective use of time. but in this instance, i needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane. and the cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community. i was like, “do you know these people?” she was like, “all i know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun.” i ran up to the giant glass window. i started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy. i was like, “drew barrymore’s character, come back!” she didn’t come back, and i missed my flight. i got on the next one they could get me on. there was a stopover in texas. you know how i feel about texas. and, uh, i get to los angeles late that night, and i’d missed my show. i’d never missed one of my shows before, and i’m so angry. and jenny’s calling me, but i’m not picking up the phone ’cause i’m blaming this entire day on her. i get back to my friend andy’s house, and i said, “andy, this relationship is messing up my entire life!” and andy goes, “you’re right.” i go, “i know! i’m right!” he goes, “yeah, you’re right.” i go, “i know, i’m right! i got to tell her about this in the morning!” i drive out of andy’s small road, and i’m t-boned. that’s the culinary way of describing it. in 1 1/2 seconds, i’m spun around, and i think i’m dead. no, wait, i’m paralyzed. and then i hear nothing. then i hear the other car skid out and drive away. 20 minutes later i’m sitting on a curb. at this point, the police have arri… have arrived, as well as my friend, andy, and that’s when i start crying. you know how when you drop a baby on the ground, it doesn’t… doesn’t start crying right away because it doesn’t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face? and then it’s like, “oh, i guess i should be doing something “that matches that. waah!” i’m crying because i’m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that, in that moment, i might have ceased to exist. like i said earlier, i don’t really believe in anything, so in my mind, that would have been the end of all things i’d experienced in my life. every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion, and… the officer comes over, and he says, “what happened?” and i said, “i got hit by this car, “and then i heard nothing, and then i heard the other car skid out and drive away.” the officer points over to the light. the other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree. i can’t help but think, “that’s karma. that’s a hit and run and hit.” and then the officer puts this form in my face, and he goes, “sign this.” and i said, “well, what does it mean?” and he goes, “it means you’re okay and that we can leave.” i was really shaken up. i was like, “i don’t know if i’m okay.” and he goes, “just sign it,” which is a very unattractive quality. when someone just repeats a command that you’ve just said no to, and it’s unattractive, but very effective, you know. i signed it. andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution, but we have to wait two hours ’cause the other driver had beat us there, and… eventually, we’re with the doctor, and andy says to him, he goes, “well, was the other guy drunk?” and the doctor says, “well, i can’t answer that.” and andy says, “was he?” he uses the technique we had learned earlier, and it works, you know. the doctor says, “well, he’s heading to jail now.” and andy and i flash each other a look like the hardy boys, like, “case closed.” a few hours later, we’re back at andy’s house, it’s probably around 3:30 in the morning, and i have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have near-death experiences. i say, “i need to call jenny and tell her that we need to get married.” and andy says, “mike… sleep on it.” and i said, “no, no, no, this makes perfect sense.” and i pick up my phone, and i dial her number. and he puts his hand over the phone, and he says, “mike… sleep on it.” he saves me. the next morning, i fly back to new york, and a few weeks later, i get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that i just described. and it had found me at fault and that i owed… and i’m not making this up… $12,000 for the repairs on the other driver’s mercedes s.u.v. and i was like, “well, this can’t be happening.” i explained to the woman, “i think it’s a misunderstanding. “the other guy was clearly drunk. it was definitely not my fault.” and she said, “i’m really sorry, but unless they change the accident report, you owe this money.” so i requested the accident report, and i’m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight. i don’t know if you’ve ever seen one of these things before… but it’s a little bit like homework for cops. and officer timson not so good with the homework. he consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two, vehicle one and vehicle two. at one point, so badly that he says p-1… that’s me… started to go, but all of a sudden v-1… that’s me also… came at a high rate of speed, crashing into him. now, i’m pretty self-destructive as a person, but i would never crash into my own car with my own car, nor would i understand how you could do that. this part is even crazier. the other driver’s statement at the scene of the accident was, “i was on venice going… uh, i’m not too sure. “i was going away from the beach. “i was driving. “i don’t know what happened. “did i hurt anyone? “i don’t know where i was going, “but i came from home. i had a sip of beer.” which is really everyone’s favorite quantity of beer. just the one sip, right? that’s what they serve these days at the home/beach/pub.\n",
            "so all of it’s mine. the officer makes one key mistake. he checks the box that finds me at fault. so i’m like, “i need to get officer timson on the phone, so we can clear up this misunderstanding.” the problem is he keeps ducking my calls, and i know ’cause i’m calling two or three times a day, leaving messages, calling departments next to his department, so he knows i’m trying to reach him. and finally, after a month of this, i get him on the phone, and i’m so relieved. and i explain this misunderstanding. and he listens to me, and he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” i know, and, i mean, that’s what i said. i go, “aren’t you listening to any of this?” i go, “and this guy was clearly drunk. “i mean, he nearly killed me. “inches from where he hit, “and i would be dead right now. “and he wants me to pay for his car? “don’t you see how crazy that is, just as one human being to another?” and he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” and he hangs up the phone. and at this point, this stops being about money, and it’s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law. this is chinatown! so i started printing up google maps of the scene of the accident and california state driving law. i’m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators. there’s only one lawyer who would consider the case. and he was an accident lawyer, and he said, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” and i said, “no,” and he says, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” and i said, “no. this isn’t about money.” and he doesn’t take the case, and this is when i start going completely mad.\n",
            "i’m up to about 4:00 or 5:00 a.m. every night just surfing the web. i get a subscription to a site called netdetective.com, which is a great site for vigilantes who have $29.95. so now i know this guy’s name, i know where he lives, i know what he does for a living. and in my mind, it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller. like, “jim bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this, “but jim bosworth had another thing coming: mike birbiglia.” i was like, “i’m gonna track down jim bosworth. “i’m gonna sue jim bosworth, and i’m gonna sue the entire los angeles police department!” at this point, people stopped talking to me entirely. my friends would call me like, “hey, what’s going on?” i’d be like, “i’ll tell you what’s going on!” i’d tell them this whole story. and they’d be like, “you should get a lawyer.” i’d be like, “this is way past lawyers! a lawyer wouldn’t even touch this!” ‘cause he wouldn’t.\n",
            "the only person who would talk to me at this point was jenny. one night, we were out to dinner at a restaurant, and she’s talking to me, but i’m not listening ’cause i’m writing down ideas i have for the case on my napkin. i’ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection, and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in, the laws the other driver broke, and the phone numbers i’m gonna call that week. and i’m so angry, i’m writing over my own handwriting to the point where i’m ripping through the napkin. and jenny looks at me, and she says, “what are you doing?” and i said, “well, this is my case.” and she says, “well, why don’t you work on that in the morning?” and i said, “well, which part of this napkin don’t you understand?” jenny says, “mike… “you’re right, “but it’s only hurting you, “and i’m just so glad that you’re alive, and i think that we should focus on that.” she only has to say it once, and i give up the case, and i pay for this guy’s car. july 7, 2007, jenny and i went to city hall and got married. i still didn’t believe in the idea of marriage, and i still don’t. but i believe in her, and i’ve given up on the idea of being right. thank you guys very much. thank you. thank you guys so much! thanks for coming here tonight and joining me. epic your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * \n",

            "wow. hey, thank you. thanks. thank you, guys. hey, seattle. nice to see you. look at this. look at us. we’re here. this is crazy. it’s insane. so about five years ago, pretty much everyone who i know started to get married, and that was strange for me because i don’t really believe in the idea of marriage. and that would have been fine, except i have a problem where sometimes when i think that i am right about something, it can be a real source of tension between me and the person i’m arguing with. and the reason it’s a source of tension is that i’m right. and so i remember distinctly talking to my friend dana, and she goes, “well, you don’t believe in marriage for you, but, of course, you believe in it for other people.” and i was like, “no, i think it’s insane, you know, for anyone.” and she said, “why?”\n",
            "and i said, “well, first of all, it just seems doomed.” you know, 50% of marriages end in divorce. that’s just first marriages, by the way. second marriages, 60% to 62% end in divorce. third marriages, 70% to 75% end in divorce. that’s a learning curve.\n",
            "second of all, monogamy’s impossible, or at the very least, not a sure thing. when i say that, i think people assume that i’m implying that men are incapable of being faithful. i think women are just as incapable, but for more sophisticated reasons, you know. i mean, with men, we’re just really simple. we have a very simple sexuality. when i say that, my female friends are like, “well, we like sex just as much as you do.” and i said, “sure, but it’s different.” and they say, “how?” and i say, “have you ever masturbated while driving a car?”\n",
            "number three… i’m never gonna be happy. why would anyone want to be a part of that? i think that’s not brought up often enough. i, um, i didn’t know that would be the reaction. oh, no, that’s the hopeful part. the, uh… i had one ally in all this, which is my friend andy, and he’s a comedian as well. not only did we decide we weren’t gonna get married, we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married. yeah, we were pretty good at it. like, we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages, you know. we were… we were pretty good. i mean, we weren’t like the best in the world. i’m sure there are better in europe. but we were… we were solid, you know. like, so, like, for example, at point my friend alex was about to get engaged. and so we just took him to dinner. and during dessert, we gave him a long, hard stare. we said, “are you sure this is what you want to do?” and then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we weren’t friends anymore. so february 27, 2007, i’m at andy’s house in los angeles. and earlier in the night, i got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone, and it was a bad one because i knew that i was right. and andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation ’cause he’s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether you’re right. he says stuff like, “she sounds crazy.” like, even if what she’s saying isn’t that crazy, like, you’d be like, “she only eats whole wheat bagels.” he’d be like, “she sounds crazy!” you’d be like, “that’s not even the crazy part!” you know. so i’m telling him about his argument. and he goes, “you’re right.” i go, “i know. i’m right.” he goes, “yeah, you’re right.” i go, “i know i’m right. i got to tell her about this in the morning.” and i get in my rental car to head back to my hotel, and i’m driving out of andy’s small road, and i’m t-boned! i don’t know if you’re familiar with this term, uh… this is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driver’s side at a 90-degree angle, like a t-bone steak. and in 1 1/2 seconds, i’m spun around, and i think i’m dead. no, wait, i’m paralyzed. and then i hear nothing. and then i hear the other car skid out and drive away. i know. let me tell you how this argument started. i met jenny in st. louis. my friend andy and i were working for her company. they were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches, which is really my demographic. i, uh… no, i was very nervous about this. i was actually kind of about to go onstage, and i was, like, scrawling notes on my napkin. a lot of times i’ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary. and jenny looked at me, and she goes, “what are you doing?” and i said, “i’m writing my set list.” and then she goes, “i think it’ll be fine.” and i was like, “no, it won’t be fine.” and then she was like, “i think it will be okay.” and i said, “why do you think that?” and she said, “well, you look so nervous, i think they’ll feel sorry for you.” but jenny has this really soft, sweet voice, like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything. at one point, she said, “it seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage.” normally, i’d be offended by that, but in this instance, i was like, “you are right. that is a great point. you are beautiful, you know.” she re… she really was. you know, from the moment i met jenny, i knew i wanted to sleep with her at least once. stay with me. uh, i mean… i mean that in, like, in the most meaningful way. like, that was the most that i was capable of in my life at that point. i… i’d jus… i’d just come off a really long, difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married, and… and then we weren’t. and then when we weren’t, i was so heartbroken, i just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely, you know, and… but from the moment i met jenny, i just wanted to be with her. and i didn’t… i didn’t think it was gonna happen. like, i don’t have that kind of confidence. i actually think of myself as a sex maybe, which is to say that if i’m seeing a girl, she’d think, “i’d have sex with him, maybe.” you know, and i’m… i’m not ashamed of that. there were periods in my life where i was a sex never. or a sex with self always. yeah. and often. surprisingly often. yeah, i just don’t give off a great first impression. like, i’ll give you an example. like, this is the shirt i decided to wear tonight. like, i didn’t… i didn’t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt. i mean, this is my “a” outfit. my “b” outfit was naked. i like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that i might be a fixer-upper. i’ve reached this point in my life i don’t really look in the mirror before i leave my apartment. i glance at it to make sure i’m not bleeding. you know what i mean? like… but i don’t stare at the mirror. if i stare at the mirror, i get angry. like, i feel like i’m complaining about a bad call a ref just made. i’m like, “come on!” “you’re blind if you’re leaving the house like that!” and the ref is god, and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline. and it’s a close game ’cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast, and i’m all riled up. i’m about to charge the field. and the guy comes by with fried dough. and i’m like, “next time.” you know, that’s how i go for fried dough, ’cause i have a problem. i just… this is ridiculous. can you follow me over here for a second? i’m gonna jump off stage. this is only in seattle where someone is wearing no shoes? no shoes or socks? what? who are you people? what is wrong with you? i would expect that behavior from this guy, but not you, sir, not you! what is this? where do you think you are? from seattle! yeah, seattle. so i’ve been going, uh, recently to a women’s exercise class. i-i’ve given up on having a traditional male physique. and so now i’m going for strong, independent woman. and, uh… it’s going pretty well, you know. i’m not as good in the class as you might think. sometimes i’ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isn’t looking. but then when she looks over, i always have to strike a pose as though i’ve been doing what everybody else has been doing. it reminds me of the olympics. you know how they do gymnastics, how they’ll have those… the girls will do those crazy flips and twirls. and every once in a while… and i’m not saying i root for this to happen, but sometimes they’ll fall, and it’s ugly ’cause they’re rolling around like, “i’m in a lot of trouble. like, i don’t even know how i got here.” but at the end of that, no matter what… and i totally fall for it. i’m like, “that can’t possibly be the same loser “from moments ago. “i mean, that’s a completely different person. “this person has much better posture, for starters.” i really wanted jenny to come out with me and andy that night in st. louis ’cause we were going out to one of these famous irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak. and so i thought that might work to my advantage. i don’t know, and, uh… i didn’t have the nerve to ask her myself, and so i convinced andy to ask her for us. and, uh… pfft. which… yeah, i don’t know if that was the best idea ’cause, uh, we’re heading… we’re in the car heading to the pub, and jenny says, “oh, i left my i.d. at the hotel.” and i was like, “oh, we can just swing back and get it.” and she’s like… she’s like, “no, it’ll be fine.” i was like, “no, it won’t be fine ’cause it’s st. patrick’s day, and there’s bouncers.” and she goes, “no, it’ll be okay.” and i was like, “no, it won’t be okay.” and then we get to the pub, and it was fine. like, the bouncer just kind of waved her through, which has not been my experience with bouncers. for me, bouncers are like prison guards. and for jenny, they’re like birthday clowns like, you know, “what can i do to make your day better?”\n",
            "you know, and that’s… we’re at the pub, and it had taken so much convincing for andy to get jenny to come out there. by the time she came out, she thought she was on a date with him. and, yeah, that wasn’t the idea. and so i said… i had to convince him to fall away as the night went on, like the red rockets on the space shuttle. and eventually, she realized she was on a date with me, and she was not happy about that. but, uh… but she warmed to me as the night went on ’cause she was drinking, and then, like… no, by the end of the night, we were laughing and having a good time, and we… i caught a break, which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends, and she and i were stuffed in this little back seat together. and it was really quiet, so i could hear her soft voice. and she told me she had just come off a long, difficult breakup, and i told her about my breakup. and for a moment there in the back seat, it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart, and… we get back to the hotel, and i offer to walk her to her room, and she says, “sure.” we get to her door, and i didn’t want this night to end. and so i build up the courage to lean in to kiss her, and she says, “oh, no, thank you.” which i thought was polite… but disappointing. i mean, there’s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because you’re really putting yourself out there. you’re just like, “i think we should connect mouths,” you know, and… the other person’s like, “i do not think we should connect mouths.” and those are… they’re two very different mouth agendas, you know. and then you just feel so stupid. you’re like, “i never should have suggested we connect mouths, you know.” this is a sore subject for me. i have sort of a long history of failed kisses. like, i… i remember growing up, like, when people started making out. like, in my time in massachusetts, it was in seventh grade. i remember… i remember it like it was yesterday ’cause i was shocked. i was like, “people we know are just making out with other people we know?” “but how?” you know. it seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden. i was like, “i am not doing that.” and collectively, all the girls in my class were like, “that is fine. “you are not on the list. “you’re not exactly a first-round draft pick for our new activity.” i was like, “perfect.” it seemed so gross to me. and it still does kind of. like, sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like, “i don’t like when i see two dudes making out in the street.” and i feel that way about anyone. like, making out is just sloppy. it’s like watching a dog eat spaghetti. that’s how i make out. is that right? does anybody know if that’s right? okay, good. so… in seventh grade, i was like, “i’m not gonna make out with anybody.” and that was fine for a while, but increasingly, it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts. it was like, the make-out club and the non-make-out club. and these were informal organizations, of course. i mean, i would be sad if that were school-sanctioned, like, “we call this meeting of the non-make-out club to order. “first order of business, nintendo. “second order of business, why doesn’t anyone like us? meeting adjourned.” i don’t know, it was a sad group, and we were losing good guys by the day. i feared… i feared that soon i would be the lone member of the non-make-out club, so i was like, “i got to try to get into the make-out club.” but it was a very intangible goal. i didn’t really talk to a lot of girls, and… there was one girl who sat in front of me in class named lisa bazetti who i had a huge crush on, but she was way out of my league. like, she had many suitors. she had… i don’t… the rest of the show is in old english. uh… she doth had many suitors! uh, no, she had many, you know, admirers. and there were three of us, really, and i was in third place in all the trade publications, but i had one advantage over these other guys, which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework, thanks to alphabetical order. bazetti, birbiglia. one time i said something on the phone that made her laugh, and i was like, “oh, this is great. i got to do that more.” and one time we were on the phone, and she was laughing so hard, i remember so well ’cause she goes, “mike, you got to stop. i’m gonna pee myself.” and i was like, “wow.” this was the closest i’d ever come to a vagina. so spent the next 15 years trying to get lisa bazetti to pee. and that’s how i ended up here. yeah. that’s how we all ended up here, in a sense. so… uh… so here’s what happened with lisa. one time i built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me, and she said yes. i couldn’t believe it. like, all of a sudden i thought, “well, maybe this will be like “one of those romantic comedy montages. “we’ll go to the carnival, we’ll get stuck “on the top of the ferris wheel, we’ll make out. “it’ll all take a minute and a half, and it will be set to phil collins song.” but i think that when you’re 12 years old, you just don’t understand certain things about your digestive system. you don’t know that you shouldn’t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler. cotton candy being the most insane of these items. it’s basically saying, “we’re gonna take sugar, “which everyone knows is bad, but then we’ll dress it up like insulation.” and i’m like, “i’m not sure “what the selling point is there. is it the sugar or the insulation?” they’re like, “we already sold it.” i’m like, “well done, way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates.” i don’t know if you have the scrambler here in seattle. i imagine you might. it travels on a truck. it is a very mobile scrambling unit. the premise is very simple. you just sit on a two-person pod with the person you are in love with, and that pod goes in a circle, which is part of a larger circle, which is part of an even grander circle. as i understand it, it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients. it was called the “shits of pants-erator,” and it was wildly successful. and then it was co-opted by the carnival workers of america. cwoa. and they said… they said, “we like it, but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff.” and then one guy says, “well, what about the ‘i think i’m gonna die-erator’?” and they’re like, “that’s good, “’cause it gets across the essence of how you feel “when you’re on the machine. “plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea, “which is a nice homage “to the original intention of the machine, “but we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff.” and then one guy goes, “well, what about the scrambler? ‘cause it scrambles you!” they’re like, “we get it, frank, but who…” frank is a maniac. this guy can’t be stopped, but every once in a while, he’s got a good idea. “but who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment?” and this one guy goes, “well, i have a nephew who’s 16 years old “and smokes pot 24 hours a day. i feel like he might be available.” and they’re like, “he sounds amazing. “we don’t even need to interview him. he sounds completely qualified.”\n",
            "i sit down with lisa on the scrambler, and i’m feeling good. like, she’s snuggling up close to me, and i’m thinking… i’m thinking like, “this could be it. “this could be where it’s all gonna happen. this is very special.” and then they put that bar seat belt down. and the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment. it’s not a ralph nader approved item. i don’t think it’s saved lives. i think the only thing it’s ever done is in a scrambler accident, it’s just sort of held someone’s esophagus down to the pavement, making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident. first rule of scrambler accident, don’t talk about scrambler accident. that’s from scrambler club. well, i knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that i was going to throw up for sure. and i even said to the 16-year-old stoner, i was like, “hey, actually…” and then he was gone. apparently, he doesn’t enjoy the second halves of sentences.\n",
            "so then i’m scrambling, and… as i am scrambling, i’m thinking, “i need to come up with a plan of some kind. i’m not going down without a fight.” my first plan was very simple. it was just don’t look at lisa, don’t look at any other people. i was like, “don’t look at lisa, “don’t look at any other people. “don’t look at lisa, “don’t look at any other people. i need a new plan.” and… the new plan was i needed to tell the scrambler operator… that he needed to stop the ride, but… the mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window. so i’m like, “i got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “i got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “i got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. please stop the ride!” and i’m back! “i’m not sure he heard me. “i got to say it louder. please stop the ride! “i’m not sure he’s paying attention. i think he might be smoking pot right now.” the third time i said, “please stop.” and then i started throwing up, and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler, just… popcorn, peanuts… insulation. really, insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa. i did not look at lisa. but i’m pretty sure she was staring at me because i was a spectacle at that point. i was spectacular. and we did not make out. i did not lose my mouth virginity that evening. two years later, it gets worse. um… i’m at the st. john’s high school, what they call a cattle call dance. this is an all boys catholic school i attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty st. john’s gymnasium like cattle, which is a friendly way to describe women, you know. so… cattle shows up at 8:00. we’ll make out with the cattle. cattle goes home at 10:00. then we go out for burgers. completely separate from the cattle analogy. it was a horrible affair. it was just like this room chock-full of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out. at this point, i was, indeed, the lone member of the non-make-out club, but it was actually worse than that ’cause i had to lie to my friends and tell them i had had my first kiss ’cause it was, like, this really tough, all boys school. and so when they would ask, like, “oh, have you had your first kiss?” i’d be like, “yeah, like, all the time. like, every… every week.” i always feared at some point there’d be a follow-up question like, “oh, yeah? what’s it like?” and i’d be like, “yeah, you know, it’s just like licking an ice cream cone.” and they’d be like, “no, it’s not. it’s like sucking on a rocket pop.” and i’d be like, “ah, wrong frozen dessert analogy.” i’m at the dance, and i’m flanked by my friend sam ricciardi. and we’re introduced by our friend tom to these girls from his town. they were the last two cows at the dance. they were like, “moo!” and we were like, “moo!” and then sam says one of these phrases i think we’ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat. he says, “you get that one.” which i know it’s the worst turn of phrase, but i’m comfortable saying it ’cause i know i’ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me, “you get that one.” and then her friend goes like, “oof.” you know, or even worse… or even worse, like, “you owe me,” which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance. i would hate to hurt someone’s credit score, you know. so he goes… he goes, “you get that one.” and then i’m just fast dancing with this girl, sandra, to young mc’s bust a move. and i’m not great at fast dancing, but they had the strobe light going, so it’s only catching me one out of every five… hey! so she’s losing interest, but at 1/5 the speed. and then i’m saved by a slow song, stairway to heaven, which is a classic make-out anthem. led zeppelin, eight minutes long. what’s great about slow dancing is you can’t really mess it up ’cause it’s just sort of a slow-motion hug. like, the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it. she’d be like, “what are you doing?” and i’d be like, “i don’t pick up on social cues,” you know. but it’s such a long song, you know, stairway, so i’m just trying not to fidget. i’m sort of a fidgety person. i feared if i fidgeted too much, i might initiate the head tilt too early. i didn’t know anything about making out, but i’d seen people do it. i could see there’s, like, a head tilt. i had heard there were tongues involved. and i could see that there was, like, some kind of space in between the two mouths. to me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing. what is happening in that space? there is no… you know, there’s no video documentation of that area. it’s like the giant squid of making out. no one has seen it alive. they’ve only seen it washed up on the shore… which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy, but… so i’m trying not to fidget. then with 1 1/2 minutes left in stairway to heaven, the song hits that crescendo… all around me, kids start to make the tilt. just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me. and i was like, “oh, no. i don’t want to be alone anymore.” and i make the slightest tilt. and then sandra comes in strong, and then it’s an all-out mouth war. and she had artillery ’cause she had braces. it was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork. as this oral atrocity is taking place, all i can think is, “i’m not alone anymore! i’m not in the non-make-out club!” and all i wanted to do was tell my friends, but i couldn’t because up until that point, i’d lied and said that i’d had my first kiss. i walked off the dance floor, sam was like, “how’d it go, dude?” i had to be like, “same as always. pretty smooth.” as the week wore on, i started to convince myself, “well, maybe it did go well, “and i should call sandra, and this could bud into a relationship of some kind,” but… i got her number from tom, and those conversations ended up being very brief, you know. we didn’t have a lot to talk about. i remember just being like, “hey, you like full house? “me neither. cool. all right. later.” you know what i mean? at certain points, i remember getting this vibe from her, kind of like, “why are you calling me?” and i remember thinking, “oh, i’m probably reading into that one too much,” and… and then she stopped calling me back. and i was like, “oh, yeah, i read into that one perfectly.” but i just felt so dumb about the whole thing, and the worst part is i couldn’t even tell my friends, until one day i was… i was standing by my locker with my friend tom, and so i said to him, i was like, “hey, what’s going on with sandra? like, she hasn’t called me back.” and tom has this knowing grin on his face. i was like, “what?” tom was like, “nothing.” and i was like, “what?” tom was like, “nothing.” and i was like, “what?” tom’s like, “oh.” “i talked to sandra, and she said “you’re the worst kisser she’s ever kissed.” and it was so devastating ’cause not only was it probably true, but i couldn’t explain to my friends why it was true. i couldn’t say, “that makes sense. i’ve never done that before.” so instead i had to play it off. i had to be like, “yeah, that sounds about right. “i’m a terrible kisser. that’s kind of my thing.” so i lean in to kiss jenny, and she says, “oh, no, thank you.” she agrees to go out with me in new york. we were both living in new york, and she gave me her number, and i typed it in my phone, and from that point on, she would be “jen, irish pub, nice.” a few weeks later, i took her out to a restaurant i couldn’t afford to show her how much money i could put on my credit card. we’re out to dinner, and she says to me, she goes, “everyone hates me at work,” and i said, “why would they hate you? i love you.” she goes, “you love me?” i go, “i mean, you seem cool.” i pulled it back. i didn’t want to show all my cards. just about nine of them. one of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said, “you know, sometimes i’ll date two people at once, and that way i’m never let down by either person.” i said, “that seems like a really smart plan. like, i’d like to do that as well.” and she said, “i’m still kind of seeing my ex-boyfriend, john, and you can see other people too, but you have to tell me if you’re seeing them.” and i was like, “all right, sounds like a plan. “got it. break! i got to go find some more people, you know.” and so a few nights later, i’m in another city, and i do a show, and after the show, i went out to a bar, and i ended up making out with this random girl. then a few nights later, i’m out to dinner with jenny, and she says, “how was your trip?” and i said, “it was great. i did some shows, “and then one night i ended up making out with this random girl.” and that didn’t go over very well in the conversation. i could sense that something was wrong. and i was like, “but i’m right about that, right? like, i’m supposed to tell you if that happens, right?” and she says, “yeah, but it doesn’t mean “that i won’t lose interest in you.” and i said, “that’s a whole new clause! “that’s a twist! what is this, the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects?” i said, “are you still seeing john?” and she said, “sometimes.” i said, “well, don’t you see the contradiction in that?” and she says, “yes.” and it gets very quiet… because we were falling in love. three weeks into my relationship with jenny, i built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to bermuda. i wanted to show her how much more money i could put on my credit card. since i didn’t have a lot left, we went to bermuda ’cause it was the off season. you can get these great deals online. because as it turns out, when it’s winter in new york, it is also winter… in bermuda, and, uh… jenny and i meet up at the airport, and she’s late, which is a big pet peeve of mine. i fancy myself as a professional traveler. i’m always two hours early, i have my pocket for my ticket and my passport, and i have laceless moccasins. i never tell jokes about bombs. and… and jenny’s late. and then we get to security, and i’m not making this up, she doesn’t have a license or a passport. and i said, “what do you mean?” i go, “how do you travel?” and she goes, “well, “usually, they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work i.d.” i don’t like to dwell on the differences between men and women, but i just can’t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport, and they would let him on the plane. but women get a pass on things like this that i find completely bewildering. i mean, if i were in charge of al-qaeda, for example, what… what i would do is i would recruit attractive women because they’re just not stopped under any circumstances. although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the 72 virgins and, you know, the women wouldn’t want that, unless they’re lesbians, although there’s an idea, you know. al-qaeda… al-qaeda could recruit hot lesbians, although… then they’d have to guarantee that the 72 virgins are also lesbians. i mean, what are the odds, you know? all 72 virgins are also lesbians, unless you think of sexuality as, like, a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity. like the 72 virgins are like, “i didn’t even know i was a lesbian “until i had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist. “and now that’s all i’m into. “i used to be into these afghani guys who are so crazy, “they’d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me “and 71 of my friends. but now i don’t see khalid in the same way anymore.” the point is, we went to bermuda, and we’re on the flight… on the flight, and the flight attendant comes over, and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us. and she says, “congratulations on your honeymoon.” and we said, “oh, no, thanks. we’re not on our honeymoon.” and she walks away, and jenny says, “that’s so funny. i don’t think i’ll ever go on a honeymoon.” and i said, “oh, really?” and she goes, “yeah. i don’t think i’d ever want to get married in my life.” and i said, “oh, really?” i go, “me too.” i said, “is that based on a principle, “or did you have a bad relationship? like, what was your first boyfriend like?” and… she told me about her first boyfriend brian. it was… they were at the same bus stop when they were 16, and they would make out on the bus, and they were together for six years. and they… you know, their relationship got deeper, and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together. and i said, “then what?” and she said, “he died. he had leukemia.” and i said, “well, do you ever talk about this with anyone?” and she says, “no, i don’t really like to talk about it.” but these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where jenny was opening up to me, and i was opening up to her. and every night we’d be up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and we were so happy, we… at one point, i was like, “well, we should do this again. “we should go on another trip. and you could get a license or a passport.” jenny said, “that sounds great, “but i don’t think i’d get a license or a passport ’cause they don’t make me get one.” and i was like, “yeah, but it’s the law.” you know. jenny says, “yeah, i don’t think i’ll get one “’cause they don’t make me get one, you know. that’s how i feel.” that’s how jenny argues things. sometimes she’ll just say, “that’s how i feel.” and i’ll say, “that’s not an argument.” “like, we’re not even in an argument right now because you don’t have an argument.” and she’ll say, “i just won that argument.” and i’ll say, “that’s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is.” and she’ll say, “i just won that argument,” again. “that’s how i feel.” you could see how this could be a little bit maddening, you know, uh… on our final day on the trip, we got into an argument about essentially nothing. she noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel, and she said, “we should play.” and i was like, “yeah, but not, like, a game.” and she said, “why?” and i said, “well, ’cause i’d win.” and she said, “no, i think i would win.” i go, “no. i know that i’d win, “and i know that what i’m supposed to say is that… “the guy says, ‘i’ll win,’ the girl says, ‘i’ll win,’ “and the guy lets her win, and then she likes him more. but i just don’t have that in me.” and jenny goes, “you don’t have to let me win. let’s go out and play.” and so we went out and played basketball, and i just kicked her ass. i mean, it was just like… it was just like… 10 to 1, you know, 11 to 1. i mean, i was having a good day, but still, i was just destroying her. and at one point, she literally said, “i’ve never met someone who’s so obsessed with the score.” and i said, “the score is what makes it a game!” so we’re arguing this over lunch, and then, again, it comes up at dinner, and then we’re still arguing about it at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning about essentially nothing. and she said, “i don’t understand why you’re so obsessed with being right.” i go, “i’m not obsessed with it. i just am.” i said, “why do you think you’re right?” and she says, “that’s how i feel.” i said, “if you think i’m so wrong about everything, why are you even with me?” and jenny says, “you can’t choose who you love.” which is true, but it doesn’t mean it’s good. i remember the first time i fell in love, i was in high school, and it was that first time where you fall in love, and you’re just like, “this is it. i found her. i’m 17 years old, and i’m done, you know.” and… her name was amanda, and she was, like, adorable and funny. and what was really exciting for me was that she was, like, a delinquent. like, i was like this play-by-the-rules school citizen, and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid, which i thought was a really strong quality. like, at one point, she was like, “it was totally messed up because it wasn’t even me. it was this other girl, and i was framed.” and i was just like, “awesome.” like no one would ever frame me for anything. i just… i thought it was like an opposites attract situation. she wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper. and i wanted to know what it was like to be cool. at one point, i was like, “do you want to write an article for the newspaper?” she goes, “i don’t want to write an article. i want to do things people write articles about.” and i was like, “good answer.”\n",
            "i find that when you fall in love, you tend to overlook certain red flags. one of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me, but then she would pull it back. she’d be like, “no one likes you at all. only kidding.” or, like, “you’re like a nerd, but you’re not even smart. just joking.” can’t choose who you love.\n",
            "second red flag with amanda was that she was a liar. and i don’t… i don’t mean that in an offensive way. like, lying was kind of like a… it’s like a sport at the school i was at. i transferred from the all boys school to this co-ed school. there was this one guy in my class named keith robbins who was a legendary liar. you’d know when he was lying ’cause he would lick his finger like a bookie, and he would dart his eyes from side to side. and he’d go, “yeah, yeah, nice. nice, you know.” and he wasn’t even handling money. like, i don’t even know what this is about. and then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant. he’d be like, “yeah, my uncle’s tony robbins, “motivational speaker. yeah, nice, you know.” and… we found out that that wasn’t even true. but even if that were true, that wouldn’t be impressive to a bunch of high school students. but i think that’s the jedi level of lying, is you lie about little stuff, and no one notices when you’re lying about big stuff. it’s like banking.\n",
            "the final red flag with amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend. i know. i’m in the future also. i think we can all see now ’cause we’re so smart, and mike’s so dumb, and, uh… you know, i can also see, in retrospect, that’s a much bigger red flag than i perceived it to be at the time, but i was so excited she was even with me at all. and she said she had another boyfriend at home, but they were in the process of breaking up, but it was a bad time ’cause his parents were sick. and so i tried to be understanding of that. you know, i went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents. and i thought, “well, this is the affirmation that i need. i’m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend.” and i drive my mom’s station wagon to amanda’s parents’ house, and i walk in the front door, and there’s amanda, and there’s her parents, and it’s going well. and a few hours go by, and this other guy comes over to the house, and his name is scott. i’m assuming he’s, like, a family friend or a relative. and slowly i’m noticing similarities between scott and things that amanda has said about her other boyfriend. they’re both in their first year in college, and they’re competitive wrestlers, and… it’s dawning on me that i’m hanging out with my girlfriend’s boyfriend. and it’s going pretty well. i mean, he… he seemed like a nice guy. i could totally see what she saw in him. there was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom, she would hold on to my hand, and she would say, “i wish it were just you and me here.” and i remember thinking, “you could make that happen.” the way she said it was as though she weren’t involved in the decision process, like, “i’d love to, but the boys in corporate…”\n",
            "well, the day took an even stranger turn when scott suggested that we go hang out at his house. and i met his parents. it is indescribable meeting your girlfriend’s boyfriend’s parents for the first time. part of you is angry for obvious reasons, but then part of you still wants to make a good impression. you know, you’re like… “maybe if this goes well, she’ll see that i’m good with adults in general!” as a side note, his parents seemed in perfect health. at one point, his dad even said to me, “how do you know amanda?” and i said, “we’re just friends from school.” and i was so ashamed, and i felt so dumb. and i drove home, and i remember thinking, “i am never gonna let this happen to me again.” so… ten months into my relationship with jenny, she invites me to meet her parents. and this was a tricky time. at this point, our relationship was intense, but casual, which is a dangerous relationship cocktail, and it was a hard thing to organize ’cause i was away probably five days out of the week. and so we found a sunday where i was coming back from a five-day stint in texas, which was awful ’cause it was… in texas. and i… that’s… that’s not to say i dislike texas entirely. it’s such a large thing to dislike. and, uh… but that week it felt like texas just disliked me, and i just kind of disliked texas back to the point where i developed a small drinking problem, which is… which is very popular in texas. i was performing at a comedy club. now, comedy… i love comedy clubs ’cause they’re sort of a high-low entertainment proposition. like, in some ways, though, they’re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word, and then some of them sell dildo straws, you know. like, there’s 15 bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends, and they’re handing out gummy penises or whatever. that’s… that’s actually a thing. i didn’t even realize that… i didn’t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was… was the gummy quality of the penis. i feel like if i were in charge of the candification of the penis, it would be hard candy. and then if… and then, if you suck it down to the gummy part, then you just sort of put that off to the side. but i… but that’s… that’s not my job. i’m… you know, i leave that to the experts, but i just… i just do the comedy part. but i was performing at this club all week, and after the late show saturday night, i was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things. and… i’d been drinking all week, and, uh, i always try to be a team player, you know. so i was like, “whatever i can do to help. i don’t see how this could end badly.” and, uh… the next morning, i wake up in the my hotel room, and i’m hung over, and i’m groggy. and i roll out of bed, and i run to the airport to catch my flight. i’m still two hours early, and… i land in new york, and i get a cab to jenny’s parents’ house. and i walk in the front door, and there’s jenny, and there’s her parents. and there’s her other sort of ex-boyfriend, john. and he wasn’t front and center. like, he was just kind of around, like, he was in the pool, like, wading and doing laps, like, that kind of thing. but i pulled jenny aside, i was like, “well, what’s john doing here?” and she says, “well, he and i aren’t still together, “but when we were together, “he became friends with my stepdad, “and he’s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks.” and i said, “you know, that’s not good. i feel like that gives him the edge.” jenny’s staring at me. and i said, “what?” she says, “you have a hickey on your neck.” and i said, “i don’t think that’s true.” and then i glance at the mirror next to me and realize that, in fact, i do have a hickey on my neck. and i say, “i’m really sorry.” and she says, “where is that from?” and i said, “there was this bachelorette party, and i was drunk.” that sentence never comes out right. i mean, there’s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay, and… we start arguing, and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment. i didn’t have a leg to stand on. i was like, “well, what about john? what was he doing there?” she said, “you have a hickey on your neck.” i said, “yeah, but at least i told you the truth.” and she said, “eventually.” and i said, “eventually is better than never!” and then she kneed me in the balls. i don’t know if you’ve ever experienced this before. i’m sure half of you have not. uh… it’s like being electrocuted, except you don’t get to die. it’s like you want to die, but you can’t. and there’s a person in your face saying, “you deserve this,” which they wouldn’t even do in electrocutions. i think they would deem that as inhumane.  even in texas.\n",
            "jenny says, “i think that we should just break up. “you know, it’s not just this. “i mean, you’re away a lot of the time. “and even when you’re here, you work at night, “and i work in the day. i just don’t think it’s gonna work out.” and i said, “okay.”  and we were apart for about six months, and i missed her so much, but i kept resisting calling her ’cause i wanted to give her space. and every once in a while i’d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from “jen, irish pub, nice.” and it would just say, “hi.” and i’d write back, “hi.” it was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another, but i think, in some ways, kept us together. and finally, on new year’s, i caved in, and i called her, i said, “hey, i really miss you, and i want to see you.” and we got together for coffee. and we hit it off just like we used to, and we decided we would get back together. we had a great period there, you know. i took her to get a license and a passport. first, we went for her social security card, and then we took that to the d.m.v. and then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport. it was like the triple crown of identifications. jenny was wildly identifiable. one night, she was heading back from my apartment to hers, and she stops. and i said, “what?” and she says, “i think that we should live together.” and i said, “no, i really don’t think that’s a good idea. “you know, i’ve just decided, you know, as a principle, “i’m not gonna get married or live with someone. it’s not personal.” and she said, “well, unless we live together, “i just don’t think it’s gonna work out “’cause we just don’t see each other enough, “and i don’t think that we stand a chance. that’s how i feel.” so we moved in together. and one day, jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends, and she invites me to come along. and i said, “oh, no, thanks.” that doesn’t go over so well. she says, “why?” and i said, “well, as you know, “i don’t believe in marriage, and so i don’t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it.” she said, “well, what do you believe in?” and i said, “i don’t know.” she said, “well, if you don’t believe in anything, how can you not believe in marriage?” and i said, “well, first of all, “you know, it just doesn’t seem necessary. “i mean, is it… you know, “marriage is an archaic institution “invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property. “i don’t want to be a part of that. “second of all, i don’t even think we have “a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is. “i mean, one of me and andy’s friends “was about to get engaged, and we were skeptical, “and we said, ‘are you sure this is the person “you want to be with for the rest of your life?’ “and he goes, ‘yeah, i think so.’ “and we said, ‘well, what if she gets in a car accident, “and she’s disfigured? would you stay with her then?’ “and he said, ‘maybe’! “that is not an acceptable answer! “third of all, if i’m so in love, “why does it need to be written into a government contract? “and i’m not one of these like, “‘i don’t want government up in my business’ kind of people! “i think the government does a nice job “delivering the mail and suggesting i don’t eat poison, “but i just don’t understand why they need to be involved “in my personal relationships. “then finally, if marriage is religious, “shouldn’t i believe in the religion? “i’ve been to more weddings of my friends “where the people on the altar don’t believe “in the religion of the church they’ve invited us to! “some of them even go to classes with the priest “in advance, to more elaborately lie “about believing in a religion they don’t believe in “just to have a wedding in a fancy building! “that is insane! that’s how i feel!” so i explain this to jenny. and jenny says, “well, if you ever did want to get married, i would marry you.” and i said, “why? aren’t you listening to any of this?” and jenny says, “that’s how i feel.” at this point, it was 5:00 in the morning, we’d been arguing all night, and we hadn’t slept. i had to catch a flight at 6:20 a.m. out of newark airport to los angeles for a show i was doing that night. at this point, i’m overtired, and i’m angry, and i’m late. i’m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase. and i walk out of our apartment. it’s 5:00 a.m., that part of the morning before the earth even exists, before they program the matrix or whatever. you walk out of your apartment, part of the road isn’t even there. there’s a guy with a laptop going, “we need a road, stat! what’s the code for building, tank?” you know, and i get to the airport. the news hasn’t even started yet. it’s just an anchor looking around like, “what are you up to?” and i get to the kiosk, and i print up my ticket, and i bring it to the security lady, and she looks at me, and she goes, “well, that ain’t your gate.” like, i guess they changed the gate, but the way she said it was as though i had participated in the decision of changing it. i was like, “i was not involved in this process. i wasn’t even c.c.’d.” like, as though i had gone to the kiosk and been like, “b22. like hell i’m flying out of b22.” and then i photoshopped my own ticket, printed it out, and been like, “this is where i’m going.” you know, i’m not that aggressive as a traveler, so i was like, “well, where is this gate?” she goes, “it’s in another terminal. you got to take a tram.” she points to the tram, and i start walking my roller suitcase, and i hear her say, “and you better run.” like, i guess i was late at that point. so i started running. and the roller suitcase does not enjoy running. the roller suitcase was like, “i don’t want to run. i have wheels.” and i was like, “i don’t want to run either, but this is what we have to do. “i tell you what, when we get to the hotel, i’ll walk you in circles for a few hours.” then i… i get to the tram, and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives. and it says zero minutes. i was like, “perfect. that’s exactly how long i want to wait.” but the tram’s riding away. i was like, “that’s -1 minute!” then it says ten minutes, and i’m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like, “oh, great, i’m gonna miss my flight, “and then i’m gonna miss every flight from now on, “and i’m gonna miss my family reunion. “and then i’m not gonna have a family, and then i’m gonna be a crack whore.” and it’s like, all of a sudden, i’m a crack whore just because i miss this one flight. i can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and…\n",
            "i get on the next tram ten minutes later, and i run to the gate, and i’m sweaty, and i’m out of breath, but i’m on time. and i’m so relieved that i sit down in a chair at the gate, and i fall asleep. and i wake up to the sound of the door shutting. i jump up, and the door is closed, and i am on the sad side of the door. the happy side has an airplane and a pilot. the sad side is me and the cinnabon lady. normally, i’d be very excited if it were just me and the cinnabon lady. i’m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year. i think that’s an effective use of time. but in this instance, i needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane. and the cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community. i was like, “do you know these people?” she was like, “all i know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun.” i ran up to the giant glass window. i started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy. i was like, “drew barrymore’s character, come back!” she didn’t come back, and i missed my flight. i got on the next one they could get me on. there was a stopover in texas. you know how i feel about texas. and, uh, i get to los angeles late that night, and i’d missed my show. i’d never missed one of my shows before, and i’m so angry. and jenny’s calling me, but i’m not picking up the phone ’cause i’m blaming this entire day on her. i get back to my friend andy’s house, and i said, “andy, this relationship is messing up my entire life!” and andy goes, “you’re right.” i go, “i know! i’m right!” he goes, “yeah, you’re right.” i go, “i know, i’m right! i got to tell her about this in the morning!” i drive out of andy’s small road, and i’m t-boned. that’s the culinary way of describing it. in 1 1/2 seconds, i’m spun around, and i think i’m dead. no, wait, i’m paralyzed. and then i hear nothing. then i hear the other car skid out and drive away. 20 minutes later i’m sitting on a curb. at this point, the police have arri… have arrived, as well as my friend, andy, and that’s when i start crying. you know how when you drop a baby on the ground, it doesn’t… doesn’t start crying right away because it doesn’t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face? and then it’s like, “oh, i guess i should be doing something “that matches that. waah!” i’m crying because i’m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that, in that moment, i might have ceased to exist. like i said earlier, i don’t really believe in anything, so in my mind, that would have been the end of all things i’d experienced in my life. every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion, and… the officer comes over, and he says, “what happened?” and i said, “i got hit by this car, “and then i heard nothing, and then i heard the other car skid out and drive away.” the officer points over to the light. the other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree. i can’t help but think, “that’s karma. that’s a hit and run and hit.” and then the officer puts this form in my face, and he goes, “sign this.” and i said, “well, what does it mean?” and he goes, “it means you’re okay and that we can leave.” i was really shaken up. i was like, “i don’t know if i’m okay.” and he goes, “just sign it,” which is a very unattractive quality. when someone just repeats a command that you’ve just said no to, and it’s unattractive, but very effective, you know. i signed it. andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution, but we have to wait two hours ’cause the other driver had beat us there, and… eventually, we’re with the doctor, and andy says to him, he goes, “well, was the other guy drunk?” and the doctor says, “well, i can’t answer that.” and andy says, “was he?” he uses the technique we had learned earlier, and it works, you know. the doctor says, “well, he’s heading to jail now.” and andy and i flash each other a look like the hardy boys, like, “case closed.” a few hours later, we’re back at andy’s house, it’s probably around 3:30 in the morning, and i have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have near-death experiences. i say, “i need to call jenny and tell her that we need to get married.” and andy says, “mike… sleep on it.” and i said, “no, no, no, this makes perfect sense.” and i pick up my phone, and i dial her number. and he puts his hand over the phone, and he says, “mike… sleep on it.” he saves me. the next morning, i fly back to new york, and a few weeks later, i get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that i just described. and it had found me at fault and that i owed… and i’m not making this up… $12,000 for the repairs on the other driver’s mercedes s.u.v. and i was like, “well, this can’t be happening.” i explained to the woman, “i think it’s a misunderstanding. “the other guy was clearly drunk. it was definitely not my fault.” and she said, “i’m really sorry, but unless they change the accident report, you owe this money.” so i requested the accident report, and i’m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight. i don’t know if you’ve ever seen one of these things before… but it’s a little bit like homework for cops. and officer timson not so good with the homework. he consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two, vehicle one and vehicle two. at one point, so badly that he says p-1… that’s me… started to go, but all of a sudden v-1… that’s me also… came at a high rate of speed, crashing into him. now, i’m pretty self-destructive as a person, but i would never crash into my own car with my own car, nor would i understand how you could do that. this part is even crazier. the other driver’s statement at the scene of the accident was, “i was on venice going… uh, i’m not too sure. “i was going away from the beach. “i was driving. “i don’t know what happened. “did i hurt anyone? “i don’t know where i was going, “but i came from home. i had a sip of beer.” which is really everyone’s favorite quantity of beer. just the one sip, right? that’s what they serve these days at the home/beach/pub.\n",
            "so all of it’s mine. the officer makes one key mistake. he checks the box that finds me at fault. so i’m like, “i need to get officer timson on the phone, so we can clear up this misunderstanding.” the problem is he keeps ducking my calls, and i know ’cause i’m calling two or three times a day, leaving messages, calling departments next to his department, so he knows i’m trying to reach him. and finally, after a month of this, i get him on the phone, and i’m so relieved. and i explain this misunderstanding. and he listens to me, and he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” i know, and, i mean, that’s what i said. i go, “aren’t you listening to any of this?” i go, “and this guy was clearly drunk. “i mean, he nearly killed me. “inches from where he hit, “and i would be dead right now. “and he wants me to pay for his car? “don’t you see how crazy that is, just as one human being to another?” and he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” and he hangs up the phone. and at this point, this stops being about money, and it’s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law. this is chinatown! so i started printing up google maps of the scene of the accident and california state driving law. i’m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators. there’s only one lawyer who would consider the case. and he was an accident lawyer, and he said, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” and i said, “no,” and he says, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” and i said, “no. this isn’t about money.” and he doesn’t take the case, and this is when i start going completely mad.\n",
            "i’m up to about 4:00 or 5:00 a.m. every night just surfing the web. i get a subscription to a site called netdetective.com, which is a great site for vigilantes who have $29.95. so now i know this guy’s name, i know where he lives, i know what he does for a living. and in my mind, it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller. like, “jim bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this, “but jim bosworth had another thing coming: mike birbiglia.” i was like, “i’m gonna track down jim bosworth. “i’m gonna sue jim bosworth, and i’m gonna sue the entire los angeles police department!” at this point, people stopped talking to me entirely. my friends would call me like, “hey, what’s going on?” i’d be like, “i’ll tell you what’s going on!” i’d tell them this whole story. and they’d be like, “you should get a lawyer.” i’d be like, “this is way past lawyers! a lawyer wouldn’t even touch this!” ‘cause he wouldn’t.\n",
            "the only person who would talk to me at this point was jenny. one night, we were out to dinner at a restaurant, and she’s talking to me, but i’m not listening ’cause i’m writing down ideas i have for the case on my napkin. i’ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection, and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in, the laws the other driver broke, and the phone numbers i’m gonna call that week. and i’m so angry, i’m writing over my own handwriting to the point where i’m ripping through the napkin. and jenny looks at me, and she says, “what are you doing?” and i said, “well, this is my case.” and she says, “well, why don’t you work on that in the morning?” and i said, “well, which part of this napkin don’t you understand?” jenny says, “mike… “you’re right, “but it’s only hurting you, “and i’m just so glad that you’re alive, and i think that we should focus on that.” she only has to say it once, and i give up the case, and i pay for this guy’s car. july 7, 2007, jenny and i went to city hall and got married. i still didn’t believe in the idea of marriage, and i still don’t. but i believe in her, and i’ve given up on the idea of being right. thank you guys very much. thank you. thank you guys so much! thanks for coming here tonight and joining me. epic your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * \n",

            "and i said “well first of all it just seems doomed” you know 50 of marriages end in divorce that’s just first marriages by the way second marriages 60 to 62 end in divorce third marriages 70 to 75 end in divorce that’s a learning curve\n",

            "number three… i’m never gonna be happy why would anyone want to be a part of that i think that’s not brought up often enough i um i didn’t know that would be the reaction oh no that’s the hopeful part the uh… i had one ally in all this which is my friend andy and he’s a comedian as well not only did we decide we weren’t gonna get married we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married yeah we were pretty good at it like we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages you know we were… we were pretty good i mean we weren’t like the best in the world i’m sure there are better in europe but we were… we were solid you know like so like for example at point my friend alex was about to get engaged and so we just took him to dinner and during dessert we gave him a long hard stare we said “are you sure this is what you want to do” and then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we weren’t friends anymore so february 27 2007 i’m at andy’s house in los angeles and earlier in the night i got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone and it was a bad one because i knew that i was right and andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation ’cause he’s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether you’re right he says stuff like “she sounds crazy” like even if what she’s saying isn’t that crazy like you’d be like “she only eats whole wheat bagels” he’d be like “she sounds crazy” you’d be like “that’s not even the crazy part” you know so i’m telling him about his argument and he goes “you’re right” i go “i know i’m right” he goes “yeah you’re right” i go “i know i’m right i got to tell her about this in the morning” and i get in my rental car to head back to my hotel and i’m driving out of andy’s small road and i’m tboned i don’t know if you’re familiar with this term uh… this is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driver’s side at a 90degree angle like a tbone steak and in 1 12 seconds i’m spun around and i think i’m dead no wait i’m paralyzed and then i hear nothing and then i hear the other car skid out and drive away i know let me tell you how this argument started i met jenny in st louis my friend andy and i were working for her company they were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches which is really my demographic i uh… no i was very nervous about this i was actually kind of about to go onstage and i was like scrawling notes on my napkin a lot of times i’ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary and jenny looked at me and she goes “what are you doing” and i said “i’m writing my set list” and then she goes “i think it’ll be fine” and i was like “no it won’t be fine” and then she was like “i think it will be okay” and i said “why do you think that” and she said “well you look so nervous i think they’ll feel sorry for you” but jenny has this really soft sweet voice like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything at one point she said “it seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage” normally i’d be offended by that but in this instance i was like “you are right that is a great point you are beautiful you know” she re… she really was you know from the moment i met jenny i knew i wanted to sleep with her at least once stay with me uh i mean… i mean that in like in the most meaningful way like that was the most that i was capable of in my life at that point i… i’d jus… i’d just come off a really long difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married and… and then we weren’t and then when we weren’t i was so heartbroken i just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely you know and… but from the moment i met jenny i just wanted to be with her and i didn’t… i didn’t think it was gonna happen like i don’t have that kind of confidence i actually think of myself as a sex maybe which is to say that if i’m seeing a girl she’d think “i’d have sex with him maybe” you know and i’m… i’m not ashamed of that there were periods in my life where i was a sex never or a sex with self always yeah and often surprisingly often yeah i just don’t give off a great first impression like i’ll give you an example like this is the shirt i decided to wear tonight like i didn’t… i didn’t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt i mean this is my “a” outfit my “b” outfit was naked i like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that i might be a fixerupper i’ve reached this point in my life i don’t really look in the mirror before i leave my apartment i glance at it to make sure i’m not bleeding you know what i mean like… but i don’t stare at the mirror if i stare at the mirror i get angry like i feel like i’m complaining about a bad call a ref just made i’m like “come on” “you’re blind if you’re leaving the house like that” and the ref is god and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline and it’s a close game ’cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast and i’m all riled up i’m about to charge the field and the guy comes by with fried dough and i’m like “next time” you know that’s how i go for fried dough ’cause i have a problem i just… this is ridiculous can you follow me over here for a second i’m gonna jump off stage this is only in seattle where someone is wearing no shoes no shoes or socks what who are you people what is wrong with you i would expect that behavior from this guy but not you sir not you what is this where do you think you are from seattle yeah seattle so i’ve been going uh recently to a women’s exercise class ii’ve given up on having a traditional male physique and so now i’m going for strong independent woman and uh… it’s going pretty well you know i’m not as good in the class as you might think sometimes i’ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isn’t looking but then when she looks over i always have to strike a pose as though i’ve been doing what everybody else has been doing it reminds me of the olympics you know how they do gymnastics how they’ll have those… the girls will do those crazy flips and twirls and every once in a while… and i’m not saying i root for this to happen but sometimes they’ll fall and it’s ugly ’cause they’re rolling around like “i’m in a lot of trouble like i don’t even know how i got here” but at the end of that no matter what… and i totally fall for it i’m like “that can’t possibly be the same loser “from moments ago “i mean that’s a completely different person “this person has much better posture for starters” i really wanted jenny to come out with me and andy that night in st louis ’cause we were going out to one of these famous irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak and so i thought that might work to my advantage i don’t know and uh… i didn’t have the nerve to ask her myself and so i convinced andy to ask her for us and uh… pfft which… yeah i don’t know if that was the best idea ’cause uh we’re heading… we’re in the car heading to the pub and jenny says “oh i left my id at the hotel” and i was like “oh we can just swing back and get it” and she’s like… she’s like “no it’ll be fine” i was like “no it won’t be fine ’cause it’s st patrick’s day and there’s bouncers” and she goes “no it’ll be okay” and i was like “no it won’t be okay” and then we get to the pub and it was fine like the bouncer just kind of waved her through which has not been my experience with bouncers for me bouncers are like prison guards and for jenny they’re like birthday clowns like you know “what can i do to make your day better”\n",
            "you know and that’s… we’re at the pub and it had taken so much convincing for andy to get jenny to come out there by the time she came out she thought she was on a date with him and yeah that wasn’t the idea and so i said… i had to convince him to fall away as the night went on like the red rockets on the space shuttle and eventually she realized she was on a date with me and she was not happy about that but uh… but she warmed to me as the night went on ’cause she was drinking and then like… no by the end of the night we were laughing and having a good time and we… i caught a break which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends and she and i were stuffed in this little back seat together and it was really quiet so i could hear her soft voice and she told me she had just come off a long difficult breakup and i told her about my breakup and for a moment there in the back seat it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart and… we get back to the hotel and i offer to walk her to her room and she says “sure” we get to her door and i didn’t want this night to end and so i build up the courage to lean in to kiss her and she says “oh no thank you” which i thought was polite… but disappointing i mean there’s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because you’re really putting yourself out there you’re just like “i think we should connect mouths” you know and… the other person’s like “i do not think we should connect mouths” and those are… they’re two very different mouth agendas you know and then you just feel so stupid you’re like “i never should have suggested we connect mouths you know” this is a sore subject for me i have sort of a long history of failed kisses like i… i remember growing up like when people started making out like in my time in massachusetts it was in seventh grade i remember… i remember it like it was yesterday ’cause i was shocked i was like “people we know are just making out with other people we know” “but how” you know it seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden i was like “i am not doing that” and collectively all the girls in my class were like “that is fine “you are not on the list “you’re not exactly a firstround draft pick for our new activity” i was like “perfect” it seemed so gross to me and it still does kind of like sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like “i don’t like when i see two dudes making out in the street” and i feel that way about anyone like making out is just sloppy it’s like watching a dog eat spaghetti that’s how i make out is that right does anybody know if that’s right okay good so… in seventh grade i was like “i’m not gonna make out with anybody” and that was fine for a while but increasingly it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts it was like the makeout club and the nonmakeout club and these were informal organizations of course i mean i would be sad if that were schoolsanctioned like “we call this meeting of the nonmakeout club to order “first order of business nintendo “second order of business why doesn’t anyone like us meeting adjourned” i don’t know it was a sad group and we were losing good guys by the day i feared… i feared that soon i would be the lone member of the nonmakeout club so i was like “i got to try to get into the makeout club” but it was a very intangible goal i didn’t really talk to a lot of girls and… there was one girl who sat in front of me in class named lisa bazetti who i had a huge crush on but she was way out of my league like she had many suitors she had… i don’t… the rest of the show is in old english uh… she doth had many suitors uh no she had many you know admirers and there were three of us really and i was in third place in all the trade publications but i had one advantage over these other guys which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework thanks to alphabetical order bazetti birbiglia one time i said something on the phone that made her laugh and i was like “oh this is great i got to do that more” and one time we were on the phone and she was laughing so hard i remember so well ’cause she goes “mike you got to stop i’m gonna pee myself” and i was like “wow” this was the closest i’d ever come to a vagina so spent the next 15 years trying to get lisa bazetti to pee and that’s how i ended up here yeah that’s how we all ended up here in a sense so… uh… so here’s what happened with lisa one time i built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me and she said yes i couldn’t believe it like all of a sudden i thought “well maybe this will be like “one of those romantic comedy montages “we’ll go to the carnival we’ll get stuck “on the top of the ferris wheel we’ll make out “it’ll all take a minute and a half and it will be set to phil collins song” but i think that when you’re 12 years old you just don’t understand certain things about your digestive system you don’t know that you shouldn’t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler cotton candy being the most insane of these items it’s basically saying “we’re gonna take sugar “which everyone knows is bad but then we’ll dress it up like insulation” and i’m like “i’m not sure “what the selling point is there is it the sugar or the insulation” they’re like “we already sold it” i’m like “well done way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates” i don’t know if you have the scrambler here in seattle i imagine you might it travels on a truck it is a very mobile scrambling unit the premise is very simple you just sit on a twoperson pod with the person you are in love with and that pod goes in a circle which is part of a larger circle which is part of an even grander circle as i understand it it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients it was called the “shits of pantserator” and it was wildly successful and then it was coopted by the carnival workers of america cwoa and they said… they said “we like it but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff” and then one guy says “well what about the ‘i think i’m gonna dieerator’” and they’re like “that’s good “’cause it gets across the essence of how you feel “when you’re on the machine “plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea “which is a nice homage “to the original intention of the machine “but we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff” and then one guy goes “well what about the scrambler ‘cause it scrambles you” they’re like “we get it frank but who…” frank is a maniac this guy can’t be stopped but every once in a while he’s got a good idea “but who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment” and this one guy goes “well i have a nephew who’s 16 years old “and smokes pot 24 hours a day i feel like he might be available” and they’re like “he sounds amazing “we don’t even need to interview him he sounds completely qualified”\n",
            "i sit down with lisa on the scrambler and i’m feeling good like she’s snuggling up close to me and i’m thinking… i’m thinking like “this could be it “this could be where it’s all gonna happen this is very special” and then they put that bar seat belt down and the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment it’s not a ralph nader approved item i don’t think it’s saved lives i think the only thing it’s ever done is in a scrambler accident it’s just sort of held someone’s esophagus down to the pavement making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident first rule of scrambler accident don’t talk about scrambler accident that’s from scrambler club well i knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that i was going to throw up for sure and i even said to the 16yearold stoner i was like “hey actually…” and then he was gone apparently he doesn’t enjoy the second halves of sentences\n",
            "so then i’m scrambling and… as i am scrambling i’m thinking “i need to come up with a plan of some kind i’m not going down without a fight” my first plan was very simple it was just don’t look at lisa don’t look at any other people i was like “don’t look at lisa “don’t look at any other people “don’t look at lisa “don’t look at any other people i need a new plan” and… the new plan was i needed to tell the scrambler operator… that he needed to stop the ride but… the mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window so i’m like “i got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride “i got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride “i got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride please stop the ride” and i’m back “i’m not sure he heard me “i got to say it louder please stop the ride “i’m not sure he’s paying attention i think he might be smoking pot right now” the third time i said “please stop” and then i started throwing up and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler just… popcorn peanuts… insulation really insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa i did not look at lisa but i’m pretty sure she was staring at me because i was a spectacle at that point i was spectacular and we did not make out i did not lose my mouth virginity that evening two years later it gets worse um… i’m at the st john’s high school what they call a cattle call dance this is an all boys catholic school i attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty st john’s gymnasium like cattle which is a friendly way to describe women you know so… cattle shows up at 800 we’ll make out with the cattle cattle goes home at 1000 then we go out for burgers completely separate from the cattle analogy it was a horrible affair it was just like this room chockfull of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out at this point i was indeed the lone member of the nonmakeout club but it was actually worse than that ’cause i had to lie to my friends and tell them i had had my first kiss ’cause it was like this really tough all boys school and so when they would ask like “oh have you had your first kiss” i’d be like “yeah like all the time like every… every week” i always feared at some point there’d be a followup question like “oh yeah what’s it like” and i’d be like “yeah you know it’s just like licking an ice cream cone” and they’d be like “no it’s not it’s like sucking on a rocket pop” and i’d be like “ah wrong frozen dessert analogy” i’m at the dance and i’m flanked by my friend sam ricciardi and we’re introduced by our friend tom to these girls from his town they were the last two cows at the dance they were like “moo” and we were like “moo” and then sam says one of these phrases i think we’ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat he says “you get that one” which i know it’s the worst turn of phrase but i’m comfortable saying it ’cause i know i’ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me “you get that one” and then her friend goes like “oof” you know or even worse… or even worse like “you owe me” which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance i would hate to hurt someone’s credit score you know so he goes… he goes “you get that one” and then i’m just fast dancing with this girl sandra to young mc’s bust a move and i’m not great at fast dancing but they had the strobe light going so it’s only catching me one out of every five… hey so she’s losing interest but at 15 the speed and then i’m saved by a slow song stairway to heaven which is a classic makeout anthem led zeppelin eight minutes long what’s great about slow dancing is you can’t really mess it up ’cause it’s just sort of a slowmotion hug like the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it she’d be like “what are you doing” and i’d be like “i don’t pick up on social cues” you know but it’s such a long song you know stairway so i’m just trying not to fidget i’m sort of a fidgety person i feared if i fidgeted too much i might initiate the head tilt too early i didn’t know anything about making out but i’d seen people do it i could see there’s like a head tilt i had heard there were tongues involved and i could see that there was like some kind of space in between the two mouths to me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing what is happening in that space there is no… you know there’s no video documentation of that area it’s like the giant squid of making out no one has seen it alive they’ve only seen it washed up on the shore… which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy but… so i’m trying not to fidget then with 1 12 minutes left in stairway to heaven the song hits that crescendo… all around me kids start to make the tilt just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me and i was like “oh no i don’t want to be alone anymore” and i make the slightest tilt and then sandra comes in strong and then it’s an allout mouth war and she had artillery ’cause she had braces it was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork as this oral atrocity is taking place all i can think is “i’m not alone anymore i’m not in the nonmakeout club” and all i wanted to do was tell my friends but i couldn’t because up until that point i’d lied and said that i’d had my first kiss i walked off the dance floor sam was like “how’d it go dude” i had to be like “same as always pretty smooth” as the week wore on i started to convince myself “well maybe it did go well “and i should call sandra and this could bud into a relationship of some kind” but… i got her number from tom and those conversations ended up being very brief you know we didn’t have a lot to talk about i remember just being like “hey you like full house “me neither cool all right later” you know what i mean at certain points i remember getting this vibe from her kind of like “why are you calling me” and i remember thinking “oh i’m probably reading into that one too much” and… and then she stopped calling me back and i was like “oh yeah i read into that one perfectly” but i just felt so dumb about the whole thing and the worst part is i couldn’t even tell my friends until one day i was… i was standing by my locker with my friend tom and so i said to him i was like “hey what’s going on with sandra like she hasn’t called me back” and tom has this knowing grin on his face i was like “what” tom was like “nothing” and i was like “what” tom was like “nothing” and i was like “what” tom’s like “oh” “i talked to sandra and she said “you’re the worst kisser she’s ever kissed” and it was so devastating ’cause not only was it probably true but i couldn’t explain to my friends why it was true i couldn’t say “that makes sense i’ve never done that before” so instead i had to play it off i had to be like “yeah that sounds about right “i’m a terrible kisser that’s kind of my thing” so i lean in to kiss jenny and she says “oh no thank you” she agrees to go out with me in new york we were both living in new york and she gave me her number and i typed it in my phone and from that point on she would be “jen irish pub nice” a few weeks later i took her out to a restaurant i couldn’t afford to show her how much money i could put on my credit card we’re out to dinner and she says to me she goes “everyone hates me at work” and i said “why would they hate you i love you” she goes “you love me” i go “i mean you seem cool” i pulled it back i didn’t want to show all my cards just about nine of them one of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said “you know sometimes i’ll date two people at once and that way i’m never let down by either person” i said “that seems like a really smart plan like i’d like to do that as well” and she said “i’m still kind of seeing my exboyfriend john and you can see other people too but you have to tell me if you’re seeing them” and i was like “all right sounds like a plan “got it break i got to go find some more people you know” and so a few nights later i’m in another city and i do a show and after the show i went out to a bar and i ended up making out with this random girl then a few nights later i’m out to dinner with jenny and she says “how was your trip” and i said “it was great i did some shows “and then one night i ended up making out with this random girl” and that didn’t go over very well in the conversation i could sense that something was wrong and i was like “but i’m right about that right like i’m supposed to tell you if that happens right” and she says “yeah but it doesn’t mean “that i won’t lose interest in you” and i said “that’s a whole new clause “that’s a twist what is this the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects” i said “are you still seeing john” and she said “sometimes” i said “well don’t you see the contradiction in that” and she says “yes” and it gets very quiet… because we were falling in love three weeks into my relationship with jenny i built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to bermuda i wanted to show her how much more money i could put on my credit card since i didn’t have a lot left we went to bermuda ’cause it was the off season you can get these great deals online because as it turns out when it’s winter in new york it is also winter… in bermuda and uh… jenny and i meet up at the airport and she’s late which is a big pet peeve of mine i fancy myself as a professional traveler i’m always two hours early i have my pocket for my ticket and my passport and i have laceless moccasins i never tell jokes about bombs and… and jenny’s late and then we get to security and i’m not making this up she doesn’t have a license or a passport and i said “what do you mean” i go “how do you travel” and she goes “well “usually they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work id” i don’t like to dwell on the differences between men and women but i just can’t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport and they would let him on the plane but women get a pass on things like this that i find completely bewildering i mean if i were in charge of alqaeda for example what… what i would do is i would recruit attractive women because they’re just not stopped under any circumstances although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the 72 virgins and you know the women wouldn’t want that unless they’re lesbians although there’s an idea you know alqaeda… alqaeda could recruit hot lesbians although… then they’d have to guarantee that the 72 virgins are also lesbians i mean what are the odds you know all 72 virgins are also lesbians unless you think of sexuality as like a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity like the 72 virgins are like “i didn’t even know i was a lesbian “until i had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist “and now that’s all i’m into “i used to be into these afghani guys who are so crazy “they’d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me “and 71 of my friends but now i don’t see khalid in the same way anymore” the point is we went to bermuda and we’re on the flight… on the flight and the flight attendant comes over and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us and she says “congratulations on your honeymoon” and we said “oh no thanks we’re not on our honeymoon” and she walks away and jenny says “that’s so funny i don’t think i’ll ever go on a honeymoon” and i said “oh really” and she goes “yeah i don’t think i’d ever want to get married in my life” and i said “oh really” i go “me too” i said “is that based on a principle “or did you have a bad relationship like what was your first boyfriend like” and… she told me about her first boyfriend brian it was… they were at the same bus stop when they were 16 and they would make out on the bus and they were together for six years and they… you know their relationship got deeper and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together and i said “then what” and she said “he died he had leukemia” and i said “well do you ever talk about this with anyone” and she says “no i don’t really like to talk about it” but these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where jenny was opening up to me and i was opening up to her and every night we’d be up till 200 or 300 in the morning and we were so happy we… at one point i was like “well we should do this again “we should go on another trip and you could get a license or a passport” jenny said “that sounds great “but i don’t think i’d get a license or a passport ’cause they don’t make me get one” and i was like “yeah but it’s the law” you know jenny says “yeah i don’t think i’ll get one “’cause they don’t make me get one you know that’s how i feel” that’s how jenny argues things sometimes she’ll just say “that’s how i feel” and i’ll say “that’s not an argument” “like we’re not even in an argument right now because you don’t have an argument” and she’ll say “i just won that argument” and i’ll say “that’s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is” and she’ll say “i just won that argument” again “that’s how i feel” you could see how this could be a little bit maddening you know uh… on our final day on the trip we got into an argument about essentially nothing she noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel and she said “we should play” and i was like “yeah but not like a game” and she said “why” and i said “well ’cause i’d win” and she said “no i think i would win” i go “no i know that i’d win “and i know that what i’m supposed to say is that… “the guy says ‘i’ll win’ the girl says ‘i’ll win’ “and the guy lets her win and then she likes him more but i just don’t have that in me” and jenny goes “you don’t have to let me win let’s go out and play” and so we went out and played basketball and i just kicked her ass i mean it was just like… it was just like… 10 to 1 you know 11 to 1 i mean i was having a good day but still i was just destroying her and at one point she literally said “i’ve never met someone who’s so obsessed with the score” and i said “the score is what makes it a game” so we’re arguing this over lunch and then again it comes up at dinner and then we’re still arguing about it at 200 or 300 in the morning about essentially nothing and she said “i don’t understand why you’re so obsessed with being right” i go “i’m not obsessed with it i just am” i said “why do you think you’re right” and she says “that’s how i feel” i said “if you think i’m so wrong about everything why are you even with me” and jenny says “you can’t choose who you love” which is true but it doesn’t mean it’s good i remember the first time i fell in love i was in high school and it was that first time where you fall in love and you’re just like “this is it i found her i’m 17 years old and i’m done you know” and… her name was amanda and she was like adorable and funny and what was really exciting for me was that she was like a delinquent like i was like this playbytherules school citizen and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid which i thought was a really strong quality like at one point she was like “it was totally messed up because it wasn’t even me it was this other girl and i was framed” and i was just like “awesome” like no one would ever frame me for anything i just… i thought it was like an opposites attract situation she wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper and i wanted to know what it was like to be cool at one point i was like “do you want to write an article for the newspaper” she goes “i don’t want to write an article i want to do things people write articles about” and i was like “good answer”\n",
            "i find that when you fall in love you tend to overlook certain red flags one of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me but then she would pull it back she’d be like “no one likes you at all only kidding” or like “you’re like a nerd but you’re not even smart just joking” can’t choose who you love\n",
            "second red flag with amanda was that she was a liar and i don’t… i don’t mean that in an offensive way like lying was kind of like a… it’s like a sport at the school i was at i transferred from the all boys school to this coed school there was this one guy in my class named keith robbins who was a legendary liar you’d know when he was lying ’cause he would lick his finger like a bookie and he would dart his eyes from side to side and he’d go “yeah yeah nice nice you know” and he wasn’t even handling money like i don’t even know what this is about and then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant he’d be like “yeah my uncle’s tony robbins “motivational speaker yeah nice you know” and… we found out that that wasn’t even true but even if that were true that wouldn’t be impressive to a bunch of high school students but i think that’s the jedi level of lying is you lie about little stuff and no one notices when you’re lying about big stuff it’s like banking\n",
            "the final red flag with amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend i know i’m in the future also i think we can all see now ’cause we’re so smart and mike’s so dumb and uh… you know i can also see in retrospect that’s a much bigger red flag than i perceived it to be at the time but i was so excited she was even with me at all and she said she had another boyfriend at home but they were in the process of breaking up but it was a bad time ’cause his parents were sick and so i tried to be understanding of that you know i went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents and i thought “well this is the affirmation that i need i’m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend” and i drive my mom’s station wagon to amanda’s parents’ house and i walk in the front door and there’s amanda and there’s her parents and it’s going well and a few hours go by and this other guy comes over to the house and his name is scott i’m assuming he’s like a family friend or a relative and slowly i’m noticing similarities between scott and things that amanda has said about her other boyfriend they’re both in their first year in college and they’re competitive wrestlers and… it’s dawning on me that i’m hanging out with my girlfriend’s boyfriend and it’s going pretty well i mean he… he seemed like a nice guy i could totally see what she saw in him there was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom she would hold on to my hand and she would say “i wish it were just you and me here” and i remember thinking “you could make that happen” the way she said it was as though she weren’t involved in the decision process like “i’d love to but the boys in corporate…”\n",
            "well the day took an even stranger turn when scott suggested that we go hang out at his house and i met his parents it is indescribable meeting your girlfriend’s boyfriend’s parents for the first time part of you is angry for obvious reasons but then part of you still wants to make a good impression you know you’re like… “maybe if this goes well she’ll see that i’m good with adults in general” as a side note his parents seemed in perfect health at one point his dad even said to me “how do you know amanda” and i said “we’re just friends from school” and i was so ashamed and i felt so dumb and i drove home and i remember thinking “i am never gonna let this happen to me again” so… ten months into my relationship with jenny she invites me to meet her parents and this was a tricky time at this point our relationship was intense but casual which is a dangerous relationship cocktail and it was a hard thing to organize ’cause i was away probably five days out of the week and so we found a sunday where i was coming back from a fiveday stint in texas which was awful ’cause it was… in texas and i… that’s… that’s not to say i dislike texas entirely it’s such a large thing to dislike and uh… but that week it felt like texas just disliked me and i just kind of disliked texas back to the point where i developed a small drinking problem which is… which is very popular in texas i was performing at a comedy club now comedy… i love comedy clubs ’cause they’re sort of a highlow entertainment proposition like in some ways though they’re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word and then some of them sell dildo straws you know like there’s 15 bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends and they’re handing out gummy penises or whatever that’s… that’s actually a thing i didn’t even realize that… i didn’t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was… was the gummy quality of the penis i feel like if i were in charge of the candification of the penis it would be hard candy and then if… and then if you suck it down to the gummy part then you just sort of put that off to the side but i… but that’s… that’s not my job i’m… you know i leave that to the experts but i just… i just do the comedy part but i was performing at this club all week and after the late show saturday night i was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things and… i’d been drinking all week and uh i always try to be a team player you know so i was like “whatever i can do to help i don’t see how this could end badly” and uh… the next morning i wake up in the my hotel room and i’m hung over and i’m groggy and i roll out of bed and i run to the airport to catch my flight i’m still two hours early and… i land in new york and i get a cab to jenny’s parents’ house and i walk in the front door and there’s jenny and there’s her parents and there’s her other sort of exboyfriend john and he wasn’t front and center like he was just kind of around like he was in the pool like wading and doing laps like that kind of thing but i pulled jenny aside i was like “well what’s john doing here” and she says “well he and i aren’t still together “but when we were together “he became friends with my stepdad “and he’s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks” and i said “you know that’s not good i feel like that gives him the edge” jenny’s staring at me and i said “what” she says “you have a hickey on your neck” and i said “i don’t think that’s true” and then i glance at the mirror next to me and realize that in fact i do have a hickey on my neck and i say “i’m really sorry” and she says “where is that from” and i said “there was this bachelorette party and i was drunk” that sentence never comes out right i mean there’s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay and… we start arguing and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment i didn’t have a leg to stand on i was like “well what about john what was he doing there” she said “you have a hickey on your neck” i said “yeah but at least i told you the truth” and she said “eventually” and i said “eventually is better than never” and then she kneed me in the balls i don’t know if you’ve ever experienced this before i’m sure half of you have not uh… it’s like being electrocuted except you don’t get to die it’s like you want to die but you can’t and there’s a person in your face saying “you deserve this” which they wouldn’t even do in electrocutions i think they would deem that as inhumane  even in texas\n",
            "jenny says “i think that we should just break up “you know it’s not just this “i mean you’re away a lot of the time “and even when you’re here you work at night “and i work in the day i just don’t think it’s gonna work out” and i said “okay”  and we were apart for about six months and i missed her so much but i kept resisting calling her ’cause i wanted to give her space and every once in a while i’d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from “jen irish pub nice” and it would just say “hi” and i’d write back “hi” it was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another but i think in some ways kept us together and finally on new year’s i caved in and i called her i said “hey i really miss you and i want to see you” and we got together for coffee and we hit it off just like we used to and we decided we would get back together we had a great period there you know i took her to get a license and a passport first we went for her social security card and then we took that to the dmv and then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport it was like the triple crown of identifications jenny was wildly identifiable one night she was heading back from my apartment to hers and she stops and i said “what” and she says “i think that we should live together” and i said “no i really don’t think that’s a good idea “you know i’ve just decided you know as a principle “i’m not gonna get married or live with someone it’s not personal” and she said “well unless we live together “i just don’t think it’s gonna work out “’cause we just don’t see each other enough “and i don’t think that we stand a chance that’s how i feel” so we moved in together and one day jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends and she invites me to come along and i said “oh no thanks” that doesn’t go over so well she says “why” and i said “well as you know “i don’t believe in marriage and so i don’t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it” she said “well what do you believe in” and i said “i don’t know” she said “well if you don’t believe in anything how can you not believe in marriage” and i said “well first of all “you know it just doesn’t seem necessary “i mean is it… you know “marriage is an archaic institution “invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property “i don’t want to be a part of that “second of all i don’t even think we have “a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is “i mean one of me and andy’s friends “was about to get engaged and we were skeptical “and we said ‘are you sure this is the person “you want to be with for the rest of your life’ “and he goes ‘yeah i think so’ “and we said ‘well what if she gets in a car accident “and she’s disfigured would you stay with her then’ “and he said ‘maybe’ “that is not an acceptable answer “third of all if i’m so in love “why does it need to be written into a government contract “and i’m not one of these like “‘i don’t want government up in my business’ kind of people “i think the government does a nice job “delivering the mail and suggesting i don’t eat poison “but i just don’t understand why they need to be involved “in my personal relationships “then finally if marriage is religious “shouldn’t i believe in the religion “i’ve been to more weddings of my friends “where the people on the altar don’t believe “in the religion of the church they’ve invited us to “some of them even go to classes with the priest “in advance to more elaborately lie “about believing in a religion they don’t believe in “just to have a wedding in a fancy building “that is insane that’s how i feel” so i explain this to jenny and jenny says “well if you ever did want to get married i would marry you” and i said “why aren’t you listening to any of this” and jenny says “that’s how i feel” at this point it was 500 in the morning we’d been arguing all night and we hadn’t slept i had to catch a flight at 620 am out of newark airport to los angeles for a show i was doing that night at this point i’m overtired and i’m angry and i’m late i’m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase and i walk out of our apartment it’s 500 am that part of the morning before the earth even exists before they program the matrix or whatever you walk out of your apartment part of the road isn’t even there there’s a guy with a laptop going “we need a road stat what’s the code for building tank” you know and i get to the airport the news hasn’t even started yet it’s just an anchor looking around like “what are you up to” and i get to the kiosk and i print up my ticket and i bring it to the security lady and she looks at me and she goes “well that ain’t your gate” like i guess they changed the gate but the way she said it was as though i had participated in the decision of changing it i was like “i was not involved in this process i wasn’t even cc’d” like as though i had gone to the kiosk and been like “b22 like hell i’m flying out of b22” and then i photoshopped my own ticket printed it out and been like “this is where i’m going” you know i’m not that aggressive as a traveler so i was like “well where is this gate” she goes “it’s in another terminal you got to take a tram” she points to the tram and i start walking my roller suitcase and i hear her say “and you better run” like i guess i was late at that point so i started running and the roller suitcase does not enjoy running the roller suitcase was like “i don’t want to run i have wheels” and i was like “i don’t want to run either but this is what we have to do “i tell you what when we get to the hotel i’ll walk you in circles for a few hours” then i… i get to the tram and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives and it says zero minutes i was like “perfect that’s exactly how long i want to wait” but the tram’s riding away i was like “that’s 1 minute” then it says ten minutes and i’m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like “oh great i’m gonna miss my flight “and then i’m gonna miss every flight from now on “and i’m gonna miss my family reunion “and then i’m not gonna have a family and then i’m gonna be a crack whore” and it’s like all of a sudden i’m a crack whore just because i miss this one flight i can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and…\n",
            "i get on the next tram ten minutes later and i run to the gate and i’m sweaty and i’m out of breath but i’m on time and i’m so relieved that i sit down in a chair at the gate and i fall asleep and i wake up to the sound of the door shutting i jump up and the door is closed and i am on the sad side of the door the happy side has an airplane and a pilot the sad side is me and the cinnabon lady normally i’d be very excited if it were just me and the cinnabon lady i’m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year i think that’s an effective use of time but in this instance i needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane and the cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community i was like “do you know these people” she was like “all i know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun” i ran up to the giant glass window i started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy i was like “drew barrymore’s character come back” she didn’t come back and i missed my flight i got on the next one they could get me on there was a stopover in texas you know how i feel about texas and uh i get to los angeles late that night and i’d missed my show i’d never missed one of my shows before and i’m so angry and jenny’s calling me but i’m not picking up the phone ’cause i’m blaming this entire day on her i get back to my friend andy’s house and i said “andy this relationship is messing up my entire life” and andy goes “you’re right” i go “i know i’m right” he goes “yeah you’re right” i go “i know i’m right i got to tell her about this in the morning” i drive out of andy’s small road and i’m tboned that’s the culinary way of describing it in 1 12 seconds i’m spun around and i think i’m dead no wait i’m paralyzed and then i hear nothing then i hear the other car skid out and drive away 20 minutes later i’m sitting on a curb at this point the police have arri… have arrived as well as my friend andy and that’s when i start crying you know how when you drop a baby on the ground it doesn’t… doesn’t start crying right away because it doesn’t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face and then it’s like “oh i guess i should be doing something “that matches that waah” i’m crying because i’m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that in that moment i might have ceased to exist like i said earlier i don’t really believe in anything so in my mind that would have been the end of all things i’d experienced in my life every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion and… the officer comes over and he says “what happened” and i said “i got hit by this car “and then i heard nothing and then i heard the other car skid out and drive away” the officer points over to the light the other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree i can’t help but think “that’s karma that’s a hit and run and hit” and then the officer puts this form in my face and he goes “sign this” and i said “well what does it mean” and he goes “it means you’re okay and that we can leave” i was really shaken up i was like “i don’t know if i’m okay” and he goes “just sign it” which is a very unattractive quality when someone just repeats a command that you’ve just said no to and it’s unattractive but very effective you know i signed it andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution but we have to wait two hours ’cause the other driver had beat us there and… eventually we’re with the doctor and andy says to him he goes “well was the other guy drunk” and the doctor says “well i can’t answer that” and andy says “was he” he uses the technique we had learned earlier and it works you know the doctor says “well he’s heading to jail now” and andy and i flash each other a look like the hardy boys like “case closed” a few hours later we’re back at andy’s house it’s probably around 330 in the morning and i have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have neardeath experiences i say “i need to call jenny and tell her that we need to get married” and andy says “mike… sleep on it” and i said “no no no this makes perfect sense” and i pick up my phone and i dial her number and he puts his hand over the phone and he says “mike… sleep on it” he saves me the next morning i fly back to new york and a few weeks later i get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that i just described and it had found me at fault and that i owed… and i’m not making this up… 12000 for the repairs on the other driver’s mercedes suv and i was like “well this can’t be happening” i explained to the woman “i think it’s a misunderstanding “the other guy was clearly drunk it was definitely not my fault” and she said “i’m really sorry but unless they change the accident report you owe this money” so i requested the accident report and i’m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight i don’t know if you’ve ever seen one of these things before… but it’s a little bit like homework for cops and officer timson not so good with the homework he consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two vehicle one and vehicle two at one point so badly that he says p1… that’s me… started to go but all of a sudden v1… that’s me also… came at a high rate of speed crashing into him now i’m pretty selfdestructive as a person but i would never crash into my own car with my own car nor would i understand how you could do that this part is even crazier the other driver’s statement at the scene of the accident was “i was on venice going… uh i’m not too sure “i was going away from the beach “i was driving “i don’t know what happened “did i hurt anyone “i don’t know where i was going “but i came from home i had a sip of beer” which is really everyone’s favorite quantity of beer just the one sip right that’s what they serve these days at the homebeachpub\n",
            "so all of it’s mine the officer makes one key mistake he checks the box that finds me at fault so i’m like “i need to get officer timson on the phone so we can clear up this misunderstanding” the problem is he keeps ducking my calls and i know ’cause i’m calling two or three times a day leaving messages calling departments next to his department so he knows i’m trying to reach him and finally after a month of this i get him on the phone and i’m so relieved and i explain this misunderstanding and he listens to me and he says “do the right thing and pay for the guy’s car” i know and i mean that’s what i said i go “aren’t you listening to any of this” i go “and this guy was clearly drunk “i mean he nearly killed me “inches from where he hit “and i would be dead right now “and he wants me to pay for his car “don’t you see how crazy that is just as one human being to another” and he says “do the right thing and pay for the guy’s car” and he hangs up the phone and at this point this stops being about money and it’s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law this is chinatown so i started printing up google maps of the scene of the accident and california state driving law i’m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators there’s only one lawyer who would consider the case and he was an accident lawyer and he said “did you have any loss of income from the accident” and i said “no” and he says “did you have any loss of income from the accident” and i said “no this isn’t about money” and he doesn’t take the case and this is when i start going completely mad\n",
            "i’m up to about 400 or 500 am every night just surfing the web i get a subscription to a site called netdetectivecom which is a great site for vigilantes who have 2995 so now i know this guy’s name i know where he lives i know what he does for a living and in my mind it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller like “jim bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this “but jim bosworth had another thing coming mike birbiglia” i was like “i’m gonna track down jim bosworth “i’m gonna sue jim bosworth and i’m gonna sue the entire los angeles police department” at this point people stopped talking to me entirely my friends would call me like “hey what’s going on” i’d be like “i’ll tell you what’s going on” i’d tell them this whole story and they’d be like “you should get a lawyer” i’d be like “this is way past lawyers a lawyer wouldn’t even touch this” ‘cause he wouldn’t\n",
            "the only person who would talk to me at this point was jenny one night we were out to dinner at a restaurant and she’s talking to me but i’m not listening ’cause i’m writing down ideas i have for the case on my napkin i’ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in the laws the other driver broke and the phone numbers i’m gonna call that week and i’m so angry i’m writing over my own handwriting to the point where i’m ripping through the napkin and jenny looks at me and she says “what are you doing” and i said “well this is my case” and she says “well why don’t you work on that in the morning” and i said “well which part of this napkin don’t you understand” jenny says “mike… “you’re right “but it’s only hurting you “and i’m just so glad that you’re alive and i think that we should focus on that” she only has to say it once and i give up the case and i pay for this guy’s car july 7 2007 jenny and i went to city hall and got married i still didn’t believe in the idea of marriage and i still don’t but i believe in her and i’ve given up on the idea of being right thank you guys very much thank you thank you guys so much thanks for coming here tonight and joining me epic your email address will not be published required fields are marked  \n",

            "wow hey thank you thanks thank you guys hey seattle nice to see you look at this look at us we’re here this is crazy it’s insane so about five years ago pretty much everyone who i know started to get married and that was strange for me because i don’t really believe in the idea of marriage and that would have been fine except i have a problem where sometimes when i think that i am right about something it can be a real source of tension between me and the person i’m arguing with and the reason it’s a source of tension is that i’m right and so i remember distinctly talking to my friend dana and she goes “well you don’t believe in marriage for you but of course you believe in it for other people” and i was like “no i think it’s insane you know for anyone” and she said “why”\n",
            "and i said “well first of all it just seems doomed” you know  of marriages end in divorce that’s just first marriages by the way second marriages  to  end in divorce third marriages  to  end in divorce that’s a learning curve\n",

            "number three… i’m never gonna be happy why would anyone want to be a part of that i think that’s not brought up often enough i um i didn’t know that would be the reaction oh no that’s the hopeful part the uh… i had one ally in all this which is my friend andy and he’s a comedian as well not only did we decide we weren’t gonna get married we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married yeah we were pretty good at it like we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages you know we were… we were pretty good i mean we weren’t like the best in the world i’m sure there are better in europe but we were… we were solid you know like so like for example at point my friend alex was about to get engaged and so we just took him to dinner and during dessert we gave him a long hard stare we said “are you sure this is what you want to do” and then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we weren’t friends anymore so february   i’m at andy’s house in los angeles and earlier in the night i got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone and it was a bad one because i knew that i was right and andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation ’cause he’s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether you’re right he says stuff like “she sounds crazy” like even if what she’s saying isn’t that crazy like you’d be like “she only eats whole wheat bagels” he’d be like “she sounds crazy” you’d be like “that’s not even the crazy part” you know so i’m telling him about his argument and he goes “you’re right” i go “i know i’m right” he goes “yeah you’re right” i go “i know i’m right i got to tell her about this in the morning” and i get in my rental car to head back to my hotel and i’m driving out of andy’s small road and i’m tboned i don’t know if you’re familiar with this term uh… this is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driver’s side at a  angle like a tbone steak and in   seconds i’m spun around and i think i’m dead no wait i’m paralyzed and then i hear nothing and then i hear the other car skid out and drive away i know let me tell you how this argument started i met jenny in st louis my friend andy and i were working for her company they were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches which is really my demographic i uh… no i was very nervous about this i was actually kind of about to go onstage and i was like scrawling notes on my napkin a lot of times i’ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary and jenny looked at me and she goes “what are you doing” and i said “i’m writing my set list” and then she goes “i think it’ll be fine” and i was like “no it won’t be fine” and then she was like “i think it will be okay” and i said “why do you think that” and she said “well you look so nervous i think they’ll feel sorry for you” but jenny has this really soft sweet voice like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything at one point she said “it seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage” normally i’d be offended by that but in this instance i was like “you are right that is a great point you are beautiful you know” she re… she really was you know from the moment i met jenny i knew i wanted to sleep with her at least once stay with me uh i mean… i mean that in like in the most meaningful way like that was the most that i was capable of in my life at that point i… i’d jus… i’d just come off a really long difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married and… and then we weren’t and then when we weren’t i was so heartbroken i just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely you know and… but from the moment i met jenny i just wanted to be with her and i didn’t… i didn’t think it was gonna happen like i don’t have that kind of confidence i actually think of myself as a sex maybe which is to say that if i’m seeing a girl she’d think “i’d have sex with him maybe” you know and i’m… i’m not ashamed of that there were periods in my life where i was a sex never or a sex with self always yeah and often surprisingly often yeah i just don’t give off a great first impression like i’ll give you an example like this is the shirt i decided to wear tonight like i didn’t… i didn’t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt i mean this is my “a” outfit my “b” outfit was naked i like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that i might be a fixerupper i’ve reached this point in my life i don’t really look in the mirror before i leave my apartment i glance at it to make sure i’m not bleeding you know what i mean like… but i don’t stare at the mirror if i stare at the mirror i get angry like i feel like i’m complaining about a bad call a ref just made i’m like “come on” “you’re blind if you’re leaving the house like that” and the ref is god and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline and it’s a close game ’cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast and i’m all riled up i’m about to charge the field and the guy comes by with fried dough and i’m like “next time” you know that’s how i go for fried dough ’cause i have a problem i just… this is ridiculous can you follow me over here for a second i’m gonna jump off stage this is only in seattle where someone is wearing no shoes no shoes or socks what who are you people what is wrong with you i would expect that behavior from this guy but not you sir not you what is this where do you think you are from seattle yeah seattle so i’ve been going uh recently to a women’s exercise class ii’ve given up on having a traditional male physique and so now i’m going for strong independent woman and uh… it’s going pretty well you know i’m not as good in the class as you might think sometimes i’ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isn’t looking but then when she looks over i always have to strike a pose as though i’ve been doing what everybody else has been doing it reminds me of the olympics you know how they do gymnastics how they’ll have those… the girls will do those crazy flips and twirls and every once in a while… and i’m not saying i root for this to happen but sometimes they’ll fall and it’s ugly ’cause they’re rolling around like “i’m in a lot of trouble like i don’t even know how i got here” but at the end of that no matter what… and i totally fall for it i’m like “that can’t possibly be the same loser “from moments ago “i mean that’s a completely different person “this person has much better posture for starters” i really wanted jenny to come out with me and andy that night in st louis ’cause we were going out to one of these famous irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak and so i thought that might work to my advantage i don’t know and uh… i didn’t have the nerve to ask her myself and so i convinced andy to ask her for us and uh… pfft which… yeah i don’t know if that was the best idea ’cause uh we’re heading… we’re in the car heading to the pub and jenny says “oh i left my id at the hotel” and i was like “oh we can just swing back and get it” and she’s like… she’s like “no it’ll be fine” i was like “no it won’t be fine ’cause it’s st patrick’s day and there’s bouncers” and she goes “no it’ll be okay” and i was like “no it won’t be okay” and then we get to the pub and it was fine like the bouncer just kind of waved her through which has not been my experience with bouncers for me bouncers are like prison guards and for jenny they’re like birthday clowns like you know “what can i do to make your day better”\n",
            "you know and that’s… we’re at the pub and it had taken so much convincing for andy to get jenny to come out there by the time she came out she thought she was on a date with him and yeah that wasn’t the idea and so i said… i had to convince him to fall away as the night went on like the red rockets on the space shuttle and eventually she realized she was on a date with me and she was not happy about that but uh… but she warmed to me as the night went on ’cause she was drinking and then like… no by the end of the night we were laughing and having a good time and we… i caught a break which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends and she and i were stuffed in this little back seat together and it was really quiet so i could hear her soft voice and she told me she had just come off a long difficult breakup and i told her about my breakup and for a moment there in the back seat it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart and… we get back to the hotel and i offer to walk her to her room and she says “sure” we get to her door and i didn’t want this night to end and so i build up the courage to lean in to kiss her and she says “oh no thank you” which i thought was polite… but disappointing i mean there’s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because you’re really putting yourself out there you’re just like “i think we should connect mouths” you know and… the other person’s like “i do not think we should connect mouths” and those are… they’re two very different mouth agendas you know and then you just feel so stupid you’re like “i never should have suggested we connect mouths you know” this is a sore subject for me i have sort of a long history of failed kisses like i… i remember growing up like when people started making out like in my time in massachusetts it was in seventh grade i remember… i remember it like it was yesterday ’cause i was shocked i was like “people we know are just making out with other people we know” “but how” you know it seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden i was like “i am not doing that” and collectively all the girls in my class were like “that is fine “you are not on the list “you’re not exactly a firstround draft pick for our new activity” i was like “perfect” it seemed so gross to me and it still does kind of like sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like “i don’t like when i see two dudes making out in the street” and i feel that way about anyone like making out is just sloppy it’s like watching a dog eat spaghetti that’s how i make out is that right does anybody know if that’s right okay good so… in seventh grade i was like “i’m not gonna make out with anybody” and that was fine for a while but increasingly it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts it was like the makeout club and the nonmakeout club and these were informal organizations of course i mean i would be sad if that were schoolsanctioned like “we call this meeting of the nonmakeout club to order “first order of business nintendo “second order of business why doesn’t anyone like us meeting adjourned” i don’t know it was a sad group and we were losing good guys by the day i feared… i feared that soon i would be the lone member of the nonmakeout club so i was like “i got to try to get into the makeout club” but it was a very intangible goal i didn’t really talk to a lot of girls and… there was one girl who sat in front of me in class named lisa bazetti who i had a huge crush on but she was way out of my league like she had many suitors she had… i don’t… the rest of the show is in old english uh… she doth had many suitors uh no she had many you know admirers and there were three of us really and i was in third place in all the trade publications but i had one advantage over these other guys which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework thanks to alphabetical order bazetti birbiglia one time i said something on the phone that made her laugh and i was like “oh this is great i got to do that more” and one time we were on the phone and she was laughing so hard i remember so well ’cause she goes “mike you got to stop i’m gonna pee myself” and i was like “wow” this was the closest i’d ever come to a vagina so spent the next  years trying to get lisa bazetti to pee and that’s how i ended up here yeah that’s how we all ended up here in a sense so… uh… so here’s what happened with lisa one time i built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me and she said yes i couldn’t believe it like all of a sudden i thought “well maybe this will be like “one of those romantic comedy montages “we’ll go to the carnival we’ll get stuck “on the top of the ferris wheel we’ll make out “it’ll all take a minute and a half and it will be set to phil collins song” but i think that when you’re  years old you just don’t understand certain things about your digestive system you don’t know that you shouldn’t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler cotton candy being the most insane of these items it’s basically saying “we’re gonna take sugar “which everyone knows is bad but then we’ll dress it up like insulation” and i’m like “i’m not sure “what the selling point is there is it the sugar or the insulation” they’re like “we already sold it” i’m like “well done way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates” i don’t know if you have the scrambler here in seattle i imagine you might it travels on a truck it is a very mobile scrambling unit the premise is very simple you just sit on a twoperson pod with the person you are in love with and that pod goes in a circle which is part of a larger circle which is part of an even grander circle as i understand it it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients it was called the “shits of pantserator” and it was wildly successful and then it was coopted by the carnival workers of america cwoa and they said… they said “we like it but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff” and then one guy says “well what about the ‘i think i’m gonna dieerator’” and they’re like “that’s good “’cause it gets across the essence of how you feel “when you’re on the machine “plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea “which is a nice homage “to the original intention of the machine “but we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff” and then one guy goes “well what about the scrambler ‘cause it scrambles you” they’re like “we get it frank but who…” frank is a maniac this guy can’t be stopped but every once in a while he’s got a good idea “but who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment” and this one guy goes “well i have a nephew who’s  years old “and smokes pot  hours a day i feel like he might be available” and they’re like “he sounds amazing “we don’t even need to interview him he sounds completely qualified”\n",
            "i sit down with lisa on the scrambler and i’m feeling good like she’s snuggling up close to me and i’m thinking… i’m thinking like “this could be it “this could be where it’s all gonna happen this is very special” and then they put that bar seat belt down and the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment it’s not a ralph nader approved item i don’t think it’s saved lives i think the only thing it’s ever done is in a scrambler accident it’s just sort of held someone’s esophagus down to the pavement making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident first rule of scrambler accident don’t talk about scrambler accident that’s from scrambler club well i knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that i was going to throw up for sure and i even said to the  stoner i was like “hey actually…” and then he was gone apparently he doesn’t enjoy the second halves of sentences\n",
            "so then i’m scrambling and… as i am scrambling i’m thinking “i need to come up with a plan of some kind i’m not going down without a fight” my first plan was very simple it was just don’t look at lisa don’t look at any other people i was like “don’t look at lisa “don’t look at any other people “don’t look at lisa “don’t look at any other people i need a new plan” and… the new plan was i needed to tell the scrambler operator… that he needed to stop the ride but… the mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window so i’m like “i got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride “i got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride “i got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride please stop the ride” and i’m back “i’m not sure he heard me “i got to say it louder please stop the ride “i’m not sure he’s paying attention i think he might be smoking pot right now” the third time i said “please stop” and then i started throwing up and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler just… popcorn peanuts… insulation really insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa i did not look at lisa but i’m pretty sure she was staring at me because i was a spectacle at that point i was spectacular and we did not make out i did not lose my mouth virginity that evening two years later it gets worse um… i’m at the st john’s high school what they call a cattle call dance this is an all boys catholic school i attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty st john’s gymnasium like cattle which is a friendly way to describe women you know so… cattle shows up at  we’ll make out with the cattle cattle goes home at  then we go out for burgers completely separate from the cattle analogy it was a horrible affair it was just like this room chockfull of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out at this point i was indeed the lone member of the nonmakeout club but it was actually worse than that ’cause i had to lie to my friends and tell them i had had my first kiss ’cause it was like this really tough all boys school and so when they would ask like “oh have you had your first kiss” i’d be like “yeah like all the time like every… every week” i always feared at some point there’d be a followup question like “oh yeah what’s it like” and i’d be like “yeah you know it’s just like licking an ice cream cone” and they’d be like “no it’s not it’s like sucking on a rocket pop” and i’d be like “ah wrong frozen dessert analogy” i’m at the dance and i’m flanked by my friend sam ricciardi and we’re introduced by our friend tom to these girls from his town they were the last two cows at the dance they were like “moo” and we were like “moo” and then sam says one of these phrases i think we’ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat he says “you get that one” which i know it’s the worst turn of phrase but i’m comfortable saying it ’cause i know i’ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me “you get that one” and then her friend goes like “oof” you know or even worse… or even worse like “you owe me” which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance i would hate to hurt someone’s credit score you know so he goes… he goes “you get that one” and then i’m just fast dancing with this girl sandra to young mc’s bust a move and i’m not great at fast dancing but they had the strobe light going so it’s only catching me one out of every five… hey so she’s losing interest but at  the speed and then i’m saved by a slow song stairway to heaven which is a classic makeout anthem led zeppelin eight minutes long what’s great about slow dancing is you can’t really mess it up ’cause it’s just sort of a slowmotion hug like the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it she’d be like “what are you doing” and i’d be like “i don’t pick up on social cues” you know but it’s such a long song you know stairway so i’m just trying not to fidget i’m sort of a fidgety person i feared if i fidgeted too much i might initiate the head tilt too early i didn’t know anything about making out but i’d seen people do it i could see there’s like a head tilt i had heard there were tongues involved and i could see that there was like some kind of space in between the two mouths to me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing what is happening in that space there is no… you know there’s no video documentation of that area it’s like the giant squid of making out no one has seen it alive they’ve only seen it washed up on the shore… which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy but… so i’m trying not to fidget then with   minutes left in stairway to heaven the song hits that crescendo… all around me kids start to make the tilt just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me and i was like “oh no i don’t want to be alone anymore” and i make the slightest tilt and then sandra comes in strong and then it’s an allout mouth war and she had artillery ’cause she had braces it was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork as this oral atrocity is taking place all i can think is “i’m not alone anymore i’m not in the nonmakeout club” and all i wanted to do was tell my friends but i couldn’t because up until that point i’d lied and said that i’d had my first kiss i walked off the dance floor sam was like “how’d it go dude” i had to be like “same as always pretty smooth” as the week wore on i started to convince myself “well maybe it did go well “and i should call sandra and this could bud into a relationship of some kind” but… i got her number from tom and those conversations ended up being very brief you know we didn’t have a lot to talk about i remember just being like “hey you like full house “me neither cool all right later” you know what i mean at certain points i remember getting this vibe from her kind of like “why are you calling me” and i remember thinking “oh i’m probably reading into that one too much” and… and then she stopped calling me back and i was like “oh yeah i read into that one perfectly” but i just felt so dumb about the whole thing and the worst part is i couldn’t even tell my friends until one day i was… i was standing by my locker with my friend tom and so i said to him i was like “hey what’s going on with sandra like she hasn’t called me back” and tom has this knowing grin on his face i was like “what” tom was like “nothing” and i was like “what” tom was like “nothing” and i was like “what” tom’s like “oh” “i talked to sandra and she said “you’re the worst kisser she’s ever kissed” and it was so devastating ’cause not only was it probably true but i couldn’t explain to my friends why it was true i couldn’t say “that makes sense i’ve never done that before” so instead i had to play it off i had to be like “yeah that sounds about right “i’m a terrible kisser that’s kind of my thing” so i lean in to kiss jenny and she says “oh no thank you” she agrees to go out with me in new york we were both living in new york and she gave me her number and i typed it in my phone and from that point on she would be “jen irish pub nice” a few weeks later i took her out to a restaurant i couldn’t afford to show her how much money i could put on my credit card we’re out to dinner and she says to me she goes “everyone hates me at work” and i said “why would they hate you i love you” she goes “you love me” i go “i mean you seem cool” i pulled it back i didn’t want to show all my cards just about nine of them one of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said “you know sometimes i’ll date two people at once and that way i’m never let down by either person” i said “that seems like a really smart plan like i’d like to do that as well” and she said “i’m still kind of seeing my exboyfriend john and you can see other people too but you have to tell me if you’re seeing them” and i was like “all right sounds like a plan “got it break i got to go find some more people you know” and so a few nights later i’m in another city and i do a show and after the show i went out to a bar and i ended up making out with this random girl then a few nights later i’m out to dinner with jenny and she says “how was your trip” and i said “it was great i did some shows “and then one night i ended up making out with this random girl” and that didn’t go over very well in the conversation i could sense that something was wrong and i was like “but i’m right about that right like i’m supposed to tell you if that happens right” and she says “yeah but it doesn’t mean “that i won’t lose interest in you” and i said “that’s a whole new clause “that’s a twist what is this the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects” i said “are you still seeing john” and she said “sometimes” i said “well don’t you see the contradiction in that” and she says “yes” and it gets very quiet… because we were falling in love three weeks into my relationship with jenny i built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to bermuda i wanted to show her how much more money i could put on my credit card since i didn’t have a lot left we went to bermuda ’cause it was the off season you can get these great deals online because as it turns out when it’s winter in new york it is also winter… in bermuda and uh… jenny and i meet up at the airport and she’s late which is a big pet peeve of mine i fancy myself as a professional traveler i’m always two hours early i have my pocket for my ticket and my passport and i have laceless moccasins i never tell jokes about bombs and… and jenny’s late and then we get to security and i’m not making this up she doesn’t have a license or a passport and i said “what do you mean” i go “how do you travel” and she goes “well “usually they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work id” i don’t like to dwell on the differences between men and women but i just can’t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport and they would let him on the plane but women get a pass on things like this that i find completely bewildering i mean if i were in charge of alqaeda for example what… what i would do is i would recruit attractive women because they’re just not stopped under any circumstances although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the  virgins and you know the women wouldn’t want that unless they’re lesbians although there’s an idea you know alqaeda… alqaeda could recruit hot lesbians although… then they’d have to guarantee that the  virgins are also lesbians i mean what are the odds you know all  virgins are also lesbians unless you think of sexuality as like a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity like the  virgins are like “i didn’t even know i was a lesbian “until i had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist “and now that’s all i’m into “i used to be into these afghani guys who are so crazy “they’d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me “and  of my friends but now i don’t see khalid in the same way anymore” the point is we went to bermuda and we’re on the flight… on the flight and the flight attendant comes over and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us and she says “congratulations on your honeymoon” and we said “oh no thanks we’re not on our honeymoon” and she walks away and jenny says “that’s so funny i don’t think i’ll ever go on a honeymoon” and i said “oh really” and she goes “yeah i don’t think i’d ever want to get married in my life” and i said “oh really” i go “me too” i said “is that based on a principle “or did you have a bad relationship like what was your first boyfriend like” and… she told me about her first boyfriend brian it was… they were at the same bus stop when they were  and they would make out on the bus and they were together for six years and they… you know their relationship got deeper and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together and i said “then what” and she said “he died he had leukemia” and i said “well do you ever talk about this with anyone” and she says “no i don’t really like to talk about it” but these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where jenny was opening up to me and i was opening up to her and every night we’d be up till  or  in the morning and we were so happy we… at one point i was like “well we should do this again “we should go on another trip and you could get a license or a passport” jenny said “that sounds great “but i don’t think i’d get a license or a passport ’cause they don’t make me get one” and i was like “yeah but it’s the law” you know jenny says “yeah i don’t think i’ll get one “’cause they don’t make me get one you know that’s how i feel” that’s how jenny argues things sometimes she’ll just say “that’s how i feel” and i’ll say “that’s not an argument” “like we’re not even in an argument right now because you don’t have an argument” and she’ll say “i just won that argument” and i’ll say “that’s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is” and she’ll say “i just won that argument” again “that’s how i feel” you could see how this could be a little bit maddening you know uh… on our final day on the trip we got into an argument about essentially nothing she noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel and she said “we should play” and i was like “yeah but not like a game” and she said “why” and i said “well ’cause i’d win” and she said “no i think i would win” i go “no i know that i’d win “and i know that what i’m supposed to say is that… “the guy says ‘i’ll win’ the girl says ‘i’ll win’ “and the guy lets her win and then she likes him more but i just don’t have that in me” and jenny goes “you don’t have to let me win let’s go out and play” and so we went out and played basketball and i just kicked her ass i mean it was just like… it was just like…  to  you know  to  i mean i was having a good day but still i was just destroying her and at one point she literally said “i’ve never met someone who’s so obsessed with the score” and i said “the score is what makes it a game” so we’re arguing this over lunch and then again it comes up at dinner and then we’re still arguing about it at  or  in the morning about essentially nothing and she said “i don’t understand why you’re so obsessed with being right” i go “i’m not obsessed with it i just am” i said “why do you think you’re right” and she says “that’s how i feel” i said “if you think i’m so wrong about everything why are you even with me” and jenny says “you can’t choose who you love” which is true but it doesn’t mean it’s good i remember the first time i fell in love i was in high school and it was that first time where you fall in love and you’re just like “this is it i found her i’m  years old and i’m done you know” and… her name was amanda and she was like adorable and funny and what was really exciting for me was that she was like a delinquent like i was like this playbytherules school citizen and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid which i thought was a really strong quality like at one point she was like “it was totally messed up because it wasn’t even me it was this other girl and i was framed” and i was just like “awesome” like no one would ever frame me for anything i just… i thought it was like an opposites attract situation she wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper and i wanted to know what it was like to be cool at one point i was like “do you want to write an article for the newspaper” she goes “i don’t want to write an article i want to do things people write articles about” and i was like “good answer”\n",
            "i find that when you fall in love you tend to overlook certain red flags one of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me but then she would pull it back she’d be like “no one likes you at all only kidding” or like “you’re like a nerd but you’re not even smart just joking” can’t choose who you love\n",
            "second red flag with amanda was that she was a liar and i don’t… i don’t mean that in an offensive way like lying was kind of like a… it’s like a sport at the school i was at i transferred from the all boys school to this coed school there was this one guy in my class named keith robbins who was a legendary liar you’d know when he was lying ’cause he would lick his finger like a bookie and he would dart his eyes from side to side and he’d go “yeah yeah nice nice you know” and he wasn’t even handling money like i don’t even know what this is about and then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant he’d be like “yeah my uncle’s tony robbins “motivational speaker yeah nice you know” and… we found out that that wasn’t even true but even if that were true that wouldn’t be impressive to a bunch of high school students but i think that’s the jedi level of lying is you lie about little stuff and no one notices when you’re lying about big stuff it’s like banking\n",
            "the final red flag with amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend i know i’m in the future also i think we can all see now ’cause we’re so smart and mike’s so dumb and uh… you know i can also see in retrospect that’s a much bigger red flag than i perceived it to be at the time but i was so excited she was even with me at all and she said she had another boyfriend at home but they were in the process of breaking up but it was a bad time ’cause his parents were sick and so i tried to be understanding of that you know i went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents and i thought “well this is the affirmation that i need i’m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend” and i drive my mom’s station wagon to amanda’s parents’ house and i walk in the front door and there’s amanda and there’s her parents and it’s going well and a few hours go by and this other guy comes over to the house and his name is scott i’m assuming he’s like a family friend or a relative and slowly i’m noticing similarities between scott and things that amanda has said about her other boyfriend they’re both in their first year in college and they’re competitive wrestlers and… it’s dawning on me that i’m hanging out with my girlfriend’s boyfriend and it’s going pretty well i mean he… he seemed like a nice guy i could totally see what she saw in him there was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom she would hold on to my hand and she would say “i wish it were just you and me here” and i remember thinking “you could make that happen” the way she said it was as though she weren’t involved in the decision process like “i’d love to but the boys in corporate…”\n",
            "well the day took an even stranger turn when scott suggested that we go hang out at his house and i met his parents it is indescribable meeting your girlfriend’s boyfriend’s parents for the first time part of you is angry for obvious reasons but then part of you still wants to make a good impression you know you’re like… “maybe if this goes well she’ll see that i’m good with adults in general” as a side note his parents seemed in perfect health at one point his dad even said to me “how do you know amanda” and i said “we’re just friends from school” and i was so ashamed and i felt so dumb and i drove home and i remember thinking “i am never gonna let this happen to me again” so… ten months into my relationship with jenny she invites me to meet her parents and this was a tricky time at this point our relationship was intense but casual which is a dangerous relationship cocktail and it was a hard thing to organize ’cause i was away probably five days out of the week and so we found a sunday where i was coming back from a fiveday stint in texas which was awful ’cause it was… in texas and i… that’s… that’s not to say i dislike texas entirely it’s such a large thing to dislike and uh… but that week it felt like texas just disliked me and i just kind of disliked texas back to the point where i developed a small drinking problem which is… which is very popular in texas i was performing at a comedy club now comedy… i love comedy clubs ’cause they’re sort of a highlow entertainment proposition like in some ways though they’re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word and then some of them sell dildo straws you know like there’s  bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends and they’re handing out gummy penises or whatever that’s… that’s actually a thing i didn’t even realize that… i didn’t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was… was the gummy quality of the penis i feel like if i were in charge of the candification of the penis it would be hard candy and then if… and then if you suck it down to the gummy part then you just sort of put that off to the side but i… but that’s… that’s not my job i’m… you know i leave that to the experts but i just… i just do the comedy part but i was performing at this club all week and after the late show saturday night i was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things and… i’d been drinking all week and uh i always try to be a team player you know so i was like “whatever i can do to help i don’t see how this could end badly” and uh… the next morning i wake up in the my hotel room and i’m hung over and i’m groggy and i roll out of bed and i run to the airport to catch my flight i’m still two hours early and… i land in new york and i get a cab to jenny’s parents’ house and i walk in the front door and there’s jenny and there’s her parents and there’s her other sort of exboyfriend john and he wasn’t front and center like he was just kind of around like he was in the pool like wading and doing laps like that kind of thing but i pulled jenny aside i was like “well what’s john doing here” and she says “well he and i aren’t still together “but when we were together “he became friends with my stepdad “and he’s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks” and i said “you know that’s not good i feel like that gives him the edge” jenny’s staring at me and i said “what” she says “you have a hickey on your neck” and i said “i don’t think that’s true” and then i glance at the mirror next to me and realize that in fact i do have a hickey on my neck and i say “i’m really sorry” and she says “where is that from” and i said “there was this bachelorette party and i was drunk” that sentence never comes out right i mean there’s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay and… we start arguing and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment i didn’t have a leg to stand on i was like “well what about john what was he doing there” she said “you have a hickey on your neck” i said “yeah but at least i told you the truth” and she said “eventually” and i said “eventually is better than never” and then she kneed me in the balls i don’t know if you’ve ever experienced this before i’m sure half of you have not uh… it’s like being electrocuted except you don’t get to die it’s like you want to die but you can’t and there’s a person in your face saying “you deserve this” which they wouldn’t even do in electrocutions i think they would deem that as inhumane  even in texas\n",
            "jenny says “i think that we should just break up “you know it’s not just this “i mean you’re away a lot of the time “and even when you’re here you work at night “and i work in the day i just don’t think it’s gonna work out” and i said “okay”  and we were apart for about six months and i missed her so much but i kept resisting calling her ’cause i wanted to give her space and every once in a while i’d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from “jen irish pub nice” and it would just say “hi” and i’d write back “hi” it was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another but i think in some ways kept us together and finally on new year’s i caved in and i called her i said “hey i really miss you and i want to see you” and we got together for coffee and we hit it off just like we used to and we decided we would get back together we had a great period there you know i took her to get a license and a passport first we went for her social security card and then we took that to the dmv and then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport it was like the triple crown of identifications jenny was wildly identifiable one night she was heading back from my apartment to hers and she stops and i said “what” and she says “i think that we should live together” and i said “no i really don’t think that’s a good idea “you know i’ve just decided you know as a principle “i’m not gonna get married or live with someone it’s not personal” and she said “well unless we live together “i just don’t think it’s gonna work out “’cause we just don’t see each other enough “and i don’t think that we stand a chance that’s how i feel” so we moved in together and one day jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends and she invites me to come along and i said “oh no thanks” that doesn’t go over so well she says “why” and i said “well as you know “i don’t believe in marriage and so i don’t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it” she said “well what do you believe in” and i said “i don’t know” she said “well if you don’t believe in anything how can you not believe in marriage” and i said “well first of all “you know it just doesn’t seem necessary “i mean is it… you know “marriage is an archaic institution “invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property “i don’t want to be a part of that “second of all i don’t even think we have “a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is “i mean one of me and andy’s friends “was about to get engaged and we were skeptical “and we said ‘are you sure this is the person “you want to be with for the rest of your life’ “and he goes ‘yeah i think so’ “and we said ‘well what if she gets in a car accident “and she’s disfigured would you stay with her then’ “and he said ‘maybe’ “that is not an acceptable answer “third of all if i’m so in love “why does it need to be written into a government contract “and i’m not one of these like “‘i don’t want government up in my business’ kind of people “i think the government does a nice job “delivering the mail and suggesting i don’t eat poison “but i just don’t understand why they need to be involved “in my personal relationships “then finally if marriage is religious “shouldn’t i believe in the religion “i’ve been to more weddings of my friends “where the people on the altar don’t believe “in the religion of the church they’ve invited us to “some of them even go to classes with the priest “in advance to more elaborately lie “about believing in a religion they don’t believe in “just to have a wedding in a fancy building “that is insane that’s how i feel” so i explain this to jenny and jenny says “well if you ever did want to get married i would marry you” and i said “why aren’t you listening to any of this” and jenny says “that’s how i feel” at this point it was  in the morning we’d been arguing all night and we hadn’t slept i had to catch a flight at  am out of newark airport to los angeles for a show i was doing that night at this point i’m overtired and i’m angry and i’m late i’m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase and i walk out of our apartment it’s  am that part of the morning before the earth even exists before they program the matrix or whatever you walk out of your apartment part of the road isn’t even there there’s a guy with a laptop going “we need a road stat what’s the code for building tank” you know and i get to the airport the news hasn’t even started yet it’s just an anchor looking around like “what are you up to” and i get to the kiosk and i print up my ticket and i bring it to the security lady and she looks at me and she goes “well that ain’t your gate” like i guess they changed the gate but the way she said it was as though i had participated in the decision of changing it i was like “i was not involved in this process i wasn’t even cc’d” like as though i had gone to the kiosk and been like “ like hell i’m flying out of ” and then i photoshopped my own ticket printed it out and been like “this is where i’m going” you know i’m not that aggressive as a traveler so i was like “well where is this gate” she goes “it’s in another terminal you got to take a tram” she points to the tram and i start walking my roller suitcase and i hear her say “and you better run” like i guess i was late at that point so i started running and the roller suitcase does not enjoy running the roller suitcase was like “i don’t want to run i have wheels” and i was like “i don’t want to run either but this is what we have to do “i tell you what when we get to the hotel i’ll walk you in circles for a few hours” then i… i get to the tram and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives and it says zero minutes i was like “perfect that’s exactly how long i want to wait” but the tram’s riding away i was like “that’s  minute” then it says ten minutes and i’m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like “oh great i’m gonna miss my flight “and then i’m gonna miss every flight from now on “and i’m gonna miss my family reunion “and then i’m not gonna have a family and then i’m gonna be a crack whore” and it’s like all of a sudden i’m a crack whore just because i miss this one flight i can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and…\n",
            "i get on the next tram ten minutes later and i run to the gate and i’m sweaty and i’m out of breath but i’m on time and i’m so relieved that i sit down in a chair at the gate and i fall asleep and i wake up to the sound of the door shutting i jump up and the door is closed and i am on the sad side of the door the happy side has an airplane and a pilot the sad side is me and the cinnabon lady normally i’d be very excited if it were just me and the cinnabon lady i’m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year i think that’s an effective use of time but in this instance i needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane and the cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community i was like “do you know these people” she was like “all i know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun” i ran up to the giant glass window i started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy i was like “drew barrymore’s character come back” she didn’t come back and i missed my flight i got on the next one they could get me on there was a stopover in texas you know how i feel about texas and uh i get to los angeles late that night and i’d missed my show i’d never missed one of my shows before and i’m so angry and jenny’s calling me but i’m not picking up the phone ’cause i’m blaming this entire day on her i get back to my friend andy’s house and i said “andy this relationship is messing up my entire life” and andy goes “you’re right” i go “i know i’m right” he goes “yeah you’re right” i go “i know i’m right i got to tell her about this in the morning” i drive out of andy’s small road and i’m tboned that’s the culinary way of describing it in   seconds i’m spun around and i think i’m dead no wait i’m paralyzed and then i hear nothing then i hear the other car skid out and drive away  minutes later i’m sitting on a curb at this point the police have arri… have arrived as well as my friend andy and that’s when i start crying you know how when you drop a baby on the ground it doesn’t… doesn’t start crying right away because it doesn’t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face and then it’s like “oh i guess i should be doing something “that matches that waah” i’m crying because i’m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that in that moment i might have ceased to exist like i said earlier i don’t really believe in anything so in my mind that would have been the end of all things i’d experienced in my life every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion and… the officer comes over and he says “what happened” and i said “i got hit by this car “and then i heard nothing and then i heard the other car skid out and drive away” the officer points over to the light the other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree i can’t help but think “that’s karma that’s a hit and run and hit” and then the officer puts this form in my face and he goes “sign this” and i said “well what does it mean” and he goes “it means you’re okay and that we can leave” i was really shaken up i was like “i don’t know if i’m okay” and he goes “just sign it” which is a very unattractive quality when someone just repeats a command that you’ve just said no to and it’s unattractive but very effective you know i signed it andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution but we have to wait two hours ’cause the other driver had beat us there and… eventually we’re with the doctor and andy says to him he goes “well was the other guy drunk” and the doctor says “well i can’t answer that” and andy says “was he” he uses the technique we had learned earlier and it works you know the doctor says “well he’s heading to jail now” and andy and i flash each other a look like the hardy boys like “case closed” a few hours later we’re back at andy’s house it’s probably around  in the morning and i have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have neardeath experiences i say “i need to call jenny and tell her that we need to get married” and andy says “mike… sleep on it” and i said “no no no this makes perfect sense” and i pick up my phone and i dial her number and he puts his hand over the phone and he says “mike… sleep on it” he saves me the next morning i fly back to new york and a few weeks later i get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that i just described and it had found me at fault and that i owed… and i’m not making this up…  for the repairs on the other driver’s mercedes suv and i was like “well this can’t be happening” i explained to the woman “i think it’s a misunderstanding “the other guy was clearly drunk it was definitely not my fault” and she said “i’m really sorry but unless they change the accident report you owe this money” so i requested the accident report and i’m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight i don’t know if you’ve ever seen one of these things before… but it’s a little bit like homework for cops and officer timson not so good with the homework he consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two vehicle one and vehicle two at one point so badly that he says … that’s me… started to go but all of a sudden … that’s me also… came at a high rate of speed crashing into him now i’m pretty selfdestructive as a person but i would never crash into my own car with my own car nor would i understand how you could do that this part is even crazier the other driver’s statement at the scene of the accident was “i was on venice going… uh i’m not too sure “i was going away from the beach “i was driving “i don’t know what happened “did i hurt anyone “i don’t know where i was going “but i came from home i had a sip of beer” which is really everyone’s favorite quantity of beer just the one sip right that’s what they serve these days at the homebeachpub\n",
            "so all of it’s mine the officer makes one key mistake he checks the box that finds me at fault so i’m like “i need to get officer timson on the phone so we can clear up this misunderstanding” the problem is he keeps ducking my calls and i know ’cause i’m calling two or three times a day leaving messages calling departments next to his department so he knows i’m trying to reach him and finally after a month of this i get him on the phone and i’m so relieved and i explain this misunderstanding and he listens to me and he says “do the right thing and pay for the guy’s car” i know and i mean that’s what i said i go “aren’t you listening to any of this” i go “and this guy was clearly drunk “i mean he nearly killed me “inches from where he hit “and i would be dead right now “and he wants me to pay for his car “don’t you see how crazy that is just as one human being to another” and he says “do the right thing and pay for the guy’s car” and he hangs up the phone and at this point this stops being about money and it’s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law this is chinatown so i started printing up google maps of the scene of the accident and california state driving law i’m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators there’s only one lawyer who would consider the case and he was an accident lawyer and he said “did you have any loss of income from the accident” and i said “no” and he says “did you have any loss of income from the accident” and i said “no this isn’t about money” and he doesn’t take the case and this is when i start going completely mad\n",
            "i’m up to about  or  am every night just surfing the web i get a subscription to a site called netdetectivecom which is a great site for vigilantes who have  so now i know this guy’s name i know where he lives i know what he does for a living and in my mind it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller like “jim bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this “but jim bosworth had another thing coming mike birbiglia” i was like “i’m gonna track down jim bosworth “i’m gonna sue jim bosworth and i’m gonna sue the entire los angeles police department” at this point people stopped talking to me entirely my friends would call me like “hey what’s going on” i’d be like “i’ll tell you what’s going on” i’d tell them this whole story and they’d be like “you should get a lawyer” i’d be like “this is way past lawyers a lawyer wouldn’t even touch this” ‘cause he wouldn’t\n",
            "the only person who would talk to me at this point was jenny one night we were out to dinner at a restaurant and she’s talking to me but i’m not listening ’cause i’m writing down ideas i have for the case on my napkin i’ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in the laws the other driver broke and the phone numbers i’m gonna call that week and i’m so angry i’m writing over my own handwriting to the point where i’m ripping through the napkin and jenny looks at me and she says “what are you doing” and i said “well this is my case” and she says “well why don’t you work on that in the morning” and i said “well which part of this napkin don’t you understand” jenny says “mike… “you’re right “but it’s only hurting you “and i’m just so glad that you’re alive and i think that we should focus on that” she only has to say it once and i give up the case and i pay for this guy’s car july   jenny and i went to city hall and got married i still didn’t believe in the idea of marriage and i still don’t but i believe in her and i’ve given up on the idea of being right thank you guys very much thank you thank you guys so much thanks for coming here tonight and joining me epic your email address will not be published required fields are marked  \n",

            "hello. hello! how you doing? great. thank you. wow. calm down. shut the fuck up. thank you. what a lovely welcome. i’m gonna try my hardest tonight. you’re thinking, “relax, we’ve had our money’s worth just seeing you.” what? you’re a legend. shut up! what is he? i’m not a god. i’m just an ordinary guy, you know, going round talking to people sort… sort of like jesus… in a way… but better. well, i’ve actually turned up. so… thank you and welcome to my new show, humanity. i don’t know why i called it that. i’m not a big fan. i prefer dogs… obviously. dogs are better people than people, aren’t they? they’re amazing, dogs. they’re our best friends. they guard us, they guide us. there’s medical detection dogs that can smell if you’ve got… aids. i’m not a doctor… but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so they go, “cor, you’re well hiv! fuck!” you know? and you go, “you can smell aids on someone?” yeah. “why didn’t you smell it on the bloke i brought home last night, you fucking idiot?” they did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. then we got involved and did some selective breeding. getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. bit stronger, faster, whatever. they’re great at the jobs they’re bred to do. they love the job they’re bred to do. they’re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. although, the rhodesian ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. i can’t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. so we’ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. a big passing-out parade. there’s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. he goes, “right, dogs!” they go, “what?” “who wants to know what job they got?” “we all do. we all do.” “okay, labradors.” “yeah?” “do you like carefully bringing back dead ducks?” “yeah?” “that’s your job.” “amazing. that is amazing. that is my favorite job. that is my favorite job.” “jack russells?” -“yeah?” -“you like shooting down rabbit holes?” -“yeah!” -“that’s your job.” “fuckin’ hell. best day ever! best day ever!” -“miniature poodles?” -“yeah?” “do you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals?” -“yeah.” -“that’s your job.” that’s your job. “ridgebacks?” “yo!” “you’re hunting lions.” “what?” “you’re hunting lions.” “fuck off!” -“yeah, you are.” -“no, we’re not. look, lions? we’ll get fucking mashed! why can’t the rottweilers hunt lions?” “they’re shaking babies.” good boy! good boy! you shake that baby if you want. good boy! cheers. this is my first new stand-up for seven years, if you don’t count the golden globes. which you shouldn’t. the golden globes. very different. god, a different vibe. two hundred million people watching. and it’s live. big thrill. but with that many people watching, there’s a bit of stick. everyone’s different, everyone’s a blogger. everyone goes, “i was offended.” -“why?” -“he said an horrible thing.” “he said loads of horrible things.” “yeah, but that was a thing that i care about.” that’s the thing about offense, it’s about personal feelings. i don’t care about the backlash. “comedian in hot water.” you know? my girlfriend, jane, she worries, and she reads things. “what have you said?” “don’t worry. they won’t come to the house. fuck ’em.” so i wind her up. i pretend i’m gonna say much worse things than i ever would. i have to make up worse jokes than i actually… just to scare my girlfriend. when i do the golden globes, we go out about a week before. it’s in la. we fly out. i’m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. they release more presenters. i take my pick. “i got a good intro for them. yeah. mel gibson? i’ll introduce him, yes.” about three days before this last one, just to wind jane up, i said, “i got a good intro.” she went, “what?” i said, “bill cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. please welcome helen mirren!” i didn’t do it. she said, “you won’t do that?” i said, “no.” next day, i got her again. i said, “is this too much?” i said, “not even bill cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. please welcome melissa mccarthy!” i didn’t do it! i would never… i’d never… tell a joke like that. it’s horrible. i was just doing it to annoy jane. i’d never even… think… of that, so don’t… even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, i said, “i’ll start with a funny one-liner. an old-fashioned joke.” she went, “what?” i said, “what did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for christmas?” jane went, “i don’t know.” i said, “cancer.” i didn’t do it, so… you’re getting offended at a joke that doesn’t exist, so… i’d never say that in public, so… to anyone who mattered, anyway. so, don’t… i didn’t have to worry about offending anyone. it just happens. the big controversy last time i did it was a caitlyn jenner joke. outrage on twitter the next day. i mean a couple of people going, “it was transphobic.” it wasn’t transphobic in the slightest. it was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. and that’s the other thing about offense. people mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. they’re not necessarily the same. i’ll tell you the joke, you make your minds up. it’s live, so they go, “your host for the 68th annual golden globes awards, please welcome ricky gervais.” they’re all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. nervously. it’s brilliant, right? so, i just go, “relax, i’m gonna be nice tonight. i’ve changed. not as much as bruce jenner, obviously.” and i go, “now caitlyn jenner, of course.” and what a year she’s had. became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. she didn’t do a lot for women drivers…” that’s a clever joke. i’ll tell you why. right? it’s layered. no, listen, right? the subject of that joke is stereotypes. i’m playing with the notion of stereotypes. i start by saying she’s a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. then if she’s a real woman, i hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. she must be a bad driver, then. right? the target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. let’s not forget that, shall we? a celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. that’s… the target of the joke, just so we’re clear. okay? she was interviewed a week later at a press conference for a show of hers. now cancelled. and… one of the press said, “what do you think of the ricky gervais joke?” she went, “maybe i should host the golden globes.” and they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. it was clickbait. i rose to the bait. obviously… i just sent back, “let her host. just don’t let her drive.” another website that was in the room, entertainment weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. their headline was “caitlyn finally breaks silence over ricky gervais.” i just sent back: “at last. she always brakes too late.” bring it on. bring it on. but i’m a considered comedian. i like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. so i was engaging these people, saying, “why is it transphobic?” they said, “it’s about a trans person.” that’s ridiculous. that’s like saying a joke about bill cosby is automatically racist. it depends on the joke. but i’m willing to learn. i found out my crime was that i dead-named her. i’d never heard that term before a day after the golden globes. and that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. but she did! i saw him on the olympic games! he was a decathlete, he was in everything! all over the place! shot put and pole vault. he won a medal! he was famous! he was on telly all the time, you know? a big… famous… man. with a huge… i don’t know. i’m guessing. probably. he was big. but i’ve learnt my lesson. now i know it’s wrong. i’d never dead-name her now. but, years ago, when she was a… man… years ago, i’m saying. and she went to the… doctor… and… knocked on the door. the doctor went, “come in!” this is years ago. i’d never dead-name her now, but this is like… a flashback before anyone… you know what… so… so, like, “come in!” and he went, “hello, bruce jenner.” because that… that was his name… then. the doctor– this was years ago… the doctor went, “all right, bruce jenner, how you doing, you fucker? you big old lunk. how you doing? come here, you, you fucker. how you doing, brucie boy?” and bruce jenner– that was his name. this is years ago. right? so… bruce jenner went, “yeah. yeah, not too bad, doctor. yeah.” “what can i do for you, bruce, you fucker? how you doing, boy?” and bruce jenner went– that was his name. bruce jenner went… “look at that.” the doctor went, “come on, bruce jenner, you know the rules.” he uses his whole name every time, for some reason… “come on, bruce jenner, you fucker. you know the rules. you can’t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate.” bruce jenner went, “no, that’s not my pole, that’s my enormous penis.” “well, seeing as it’s your penis, you can bring it in here. but you should have left your shot puts outside.” and bruce jenner went… that was his name for… fifty-eight years, i think. he went, “no, they’re not my shot puts, doctor, they’re my enormous testicles.” that’s where i keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? and the doctor went, “oh yeah. that makes perfect– i’m a medical man. you’re a big bloke. you fucker. how you doing, boy? you’re a big… you’re big, and you would have a big old… cock and… balls. they’re beautiful.” bit familiar, innit? “no, you must be very proud of them, bruce.” bruce went, “this is going to surprise you, doctor. i wanna get rid of them.” and the doctor went, “what? why?” “oh, they get in the way.” “in the way of what?” “fucking driving, for one thing!” so, i’m engaging these people, and i’m saying, “but i had to say her old name. that’s the joke. i say, “i’ve changed. not as much as bruce jenner.” then i do the joke.” but, no. this is my second crime. i say, she hasn’t changed. she’s always identified as a woman. that means she’s a woman. fine, if that’s the rules. if you feel you’re a woman, you are. i’m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. in fact, i don’t think it’s going far enough. cause i’ve always identified as a chimp, right? well, i am a chimp. if i say i’m a chimp, i am a chimp. pre-op. but… don’t ever dead-name me. don’t call me ricky gervais again. from now on, you call me bobo. i’m gonna have species realignment. i’m halfway there. i’m short, with short legs and long arms. i stoop. my back’s getting hairier by the day. i’ve got fangs, like that. i love nuts. i love nuts. once, i was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so i just started masturbating, like… so… i am a chimp, right? i am a chimp if i say i’m a chimp. i’ve got to live as a chimp for a year. then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. that’d be lovely. i’m gonna stay a male chimp… so i can keep all that, right? male, heterosexual chimp. keep the same girlfriend. jane would be happy. she loves me, she loves chimps, so… you know. i reckon that’s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, we’re so close, than for a man to turn into a woman, in many ways. a bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off… and a hole gouged out, into– i’m not a doctor! but that is… the gist of it. i know which one i’d rather have done. i’m not saying chimps are better than women. no way. right? any ladies here? i can’t see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equal… to a chimp. so… so, i’d have all that done, hair and that. i’d do all that, all the… i’ll retain the ability to speak english. like in emergencies. i’m talking to jane, she’s going, “what is it?” “what is it, bobo?” “you left the fucking oven on! there’s a fire!” are you saying that if caitlyn jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, she’d… revert. she’d be over that fucking… easy. so i’d have all that done. top lip. doing all that. right? i’ll be legally a chimp. i’ll be well… properly chimped-up. i’ll be able to use chimp toilets! i’ll be walking along, holding jane’s hand. “come on, bobo.” right? we don’t hold hands now. i don’t know why she’s all over me now i’m a chimp. but we’ll be all in love. maybe matching jumpers. “come on, bobo.” in love. just two… like that. then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, “that’s fucking disgusting.” i’ll fling shit at him and run up a tree. and that’s why that joke isn’t transphobic. so… cheers. so, humanity. what is humanity? what are we? well, we’ve touched upon it there. we’re great apes. not metaphorically! we’re literally great apes. we are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. we’re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. we left our common ancestor about six million years ago. we have the same life cycle. same as any other animal. which is… our parents mate… we’re born… we grow… we mate… our parents die… our friends die… and then we die. now… my seven-year-old niece didn’t like hearing that. but i said, “you’ve gotta learn. stop crying.” i said, “you’re seven. you know… today. so… any more grizzling and this party’s cancelled, so…” let’s take the first of those. birth. it’s odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. i mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. that’s why the skull is in parts and supple. then we go on gestating outside the womb. that’s why we’re so useless. look at other mammals. a giraffe is walking along. it goes, “i’m proper pregnant.” right? i’m gonna have a baby giraffe right here. yeah, there it is. see you later. and the baby goes, “mum!” it’s got to be fucking ready. we’re… we’re helpless, right? just think, nine months we’re growing in this perfect environment. everything’s… it’s like being in a little kate bush video, right? then, suddenly, you’re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. you’re covered in shit, there’s screaming. you go, “i can’t breathe.” someone goes, “yes, you fucking can!” the first one second of life on earth. you don’t know where you are. you can’t choose where you’re born. i was born in whitley estate in reading, right? i wouldn’t have chosen that. i’d have chosen hampstead. i did choose hampstead. it just took 45 years to be able to afford it. very different. very different, my upbringing to how i live now. now i live a privileged life. hampstead is ridiculous. it’s a rarefied place. it’s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? but, growing up, it was tough! i don’t know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. it felt like wildlife. i was weak and vulnerable. there was danger round every corner. my school was on my street and i ran there every day, so i didn’t get mugged or molested. there weren’t many pedophiles in reading, the murderers had killed a lot. but there was still a couple. i moved to hampstead. oh my god! there’s no crime! i saw a knife once in hampstead. it was a palette knife. just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him “bender”. it was weird! i know my life has changed drastically, it wasn’t always like that. as a famous person, you read about yourself. gossip and twitter and everything. one thing kept cropping up, even as i prepared for this tour. people kept saying, “he’s out of touch. he’s so famous. he’s rich. he’s mega-rich.” i am. right? i could have this place burnt down for a laugh. no, but they say things like, “he’s an observational comedian. how can he say things that relate to ordinary… scum.” and i say.. i say, “don’t call them scum, right?” but even the papers, they try and… get around to it. i do interviews and they’ll always say, “do you always fly first class?” i go, “no. often private.” right? the number of times i’ve answered this question. they say, “do you know how much a pint of milk is?” to make you look out of touch. i don’t know, but that’s irrelevant. next time a journalist asks me, i’ll say, “i don’t know. but here’s a grand. run and get me one.” is that enough? that enough? yeah. another question i always get, particularly with the posh sundays, doing a profile piece. they’re still trying to alienate you, make you look different. they say things like, “you don’t have children.” i say, “no.” “why don’t you have children?” which is an odd question. why don’t you have children? as opposed to asking people, “why do you have children?” let’s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she’s had eight, shall we? nine! that one just fell out. that one didn’t even touch the sides. or… disturb her cigarette. that one just… go and claim for that. people say it’s selfish to not have children. how is it selfish to not bring a life into the world that doesn’t exist on any level? there’s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, “we want to be born!” right? but i’ve thought about it and there’s three reasons i don’t have children. three main reasons and i’ll share them with you. three reasons. one. there’s millions! the world’s over-populated. no-one’s going, “rick’s not having kids. we’re gonna run out. fuck.” two. kids are scroungers. aren’t they? i mean, from day one, it’s all “me, me, me”, isn’t it? “feed me.” “clothe me.” “pay for my chemotherapy.” no… no. not my problem, son. not mine. luck of the draw, boy. luck of the draw. it costs the average household in the west $200,000 to bring up a child. and they don’t want to pay you back. they’re not grateful. they don’t go, “thanks for having me.” it’s “i didn’t wanna be born.” even if they get a top job, which they won’t, you’ll never see that money back. they’ll just put you in a home, okay? and my kid, he’d be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldn’t he? so… he’d be a little cunt. a little hampstead cunt… running around with all the other fucking little hampstead cunts, being all hampstead and cunty. “i’m a little hampstead cunt.” yes, i know. “these are my cunty friends.” i know, it’s obvious. i can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you’re little hampstead cunts, you little posh hampstead… first, he’d know he was a little hampstead cunt. “i’m a little…” yes, we know. everyone knows, right? he’d know that, right? on the other hand, he’d know he’d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. i’d say, “i worked my way up from nothing, and you’re just a useless hampstead cunt.” he’d go, “yeah.” and that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. eleven, twelve, he’d be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. then he’d turn to drugs. about 30, he’d come home, and overdose on my afghan rug. twenty grand, that was, right? and as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle… his little fucking dying words, he’d go, “do you love me now, daddy?” no! no. no, i never did. that’s why you’ll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, hampstead cunt. and, three… i’d worry sick about him. you know? no i would! i’ve only got a cat now and i worry sick about her. i check the door three times when i go out, so she doesn’t escape. i put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she’s peckish. a human baby? oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? i’d watch it sleep. you know? we said how weak and vulnerable they are. oh, my god! you perfect little thing. oh, you flesh of my flesh. now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. night, night. sleep tight. don’t let the bedbugs… dead. yeah. just… why? why is it dead? it’s just fucking dead, look! fuck’s sake! fucking hell. what the… what a fucking waste of time that was! fuck’s sake. embarrassing. “jane?” -“what?” -“come here.” -“i’m in the shower.” -“come here.” “what?” “fucking dead already. i didn’t… just fucking… fucking hell, jane. you call that a baby? that is…” if jane was out, i’d have to text her, wouldn’t i? what could you… “baby’s dead.” she’d come back. “what the fuck?” i’d go, “yep… forget the pampers. lol.” but even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. i’d have to pad them so it didn’t run into it, cave its head in and die. then social services come round and say, “is this your child, mr. gervais?” -“yeah.” -“what happened here, then?” i go, “it’s a fucking idiot.” i did think of adopting for a while. a little third world child. because that would tick all three boxes. one, i wouldn’t be adding to the population problem. i’d be alleviating an existing problem. a young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, i can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. right? two. he would be grateful, wouldn’t he? he’d wanna pay me back, woudn’t he? particularly if i let him know the other kids in the village weren’t so lucky. they didn’t… they didn’t make it out. right? i’d tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. i’d go, “tunde, come here. come here. yeah, yeah. go and pop a shirt on, you’re not in africa now. that’s better. yeah. tunde, look– yeah! water straight out of a tap, innit? yes! yeah. yeah! no, it’s not free. it’s hampstead, you know, but… yeah, course it’s safe. safe, fresh drinking water. have as much as you want. have a bucket full. fresh drinking water. there you go. go and clean the car. go on.” no, i’d go, “look. remember all your friends in the village back in africa? they’re all dead. a rich man didn’t save them and bring them to hampstead. -do you wanna pay me back?” -“yeah.” “yeah, i bet you do.” the good thing about them is, they can start work when they’re about… six. i just call up nike and i go… “do you still make your stuff in sweatshops? got a great little worker here, yeah. pound a day’s fine. he’s gotta start somewhere. and, three… if he ran round and caved his head in… and died, and social services came round and said, “is this your child, mr gervais?” i’d go, “does it look like mine?” i’d go… “this is hampstead. it’s obviously broken in.” that’s why i don’t have kids. even though i don’t have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like i give a shit. i don’t mean my own family. they’ve given up. i’ve got older brothers and sisters. they’ve had loads of kids. and their kids have kids, and then their kids! there’s about 50. i don’t know all their names. i see them at christmas. it’s all “uncle ricky!” they know i’ve got a bit of cash. they go through my pockets, and then fuck off. it’s like being mugged by mice, right? i don’t mean them, i mean strangers. i could be busy, i could be working, like on the set of a tv or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. you get someone who’s in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. “good. be with you in a minute.” then they hover. -“busy?” -i go, “yeah! yes. yeah.” they go, “working the weekend?” i go, “not filming, but i’ll be in the edit.” “i’m taking my youngest to ballet lessons.” “ah. great. great.” “yeah, she’s eight.” “i’ve got a photograph.” i go, “you know what? show me it if she goes missing. i’ll keep an eye open in the woods.” you’ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, “she’s beautiful.” it’s gotta be long. too short, it’s awkward. they know. you go, “yeah, right.” too long and it’s like, “she’s… she’s fucking beautiful.” it’s a minefield, innit? so… i’m not out of touch. but i am spoiled. there’s a difference. i didn’t have any money until i was 40. i’ve got the same family, friends and values. but i am spoiled. because opportunity and privilege spoils you. and it doesn’t take much. i’l give you an example. when i first made it in america, the next time we flew, we’re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. and he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. the first time, you’re horrified. “everyone’s looking.” pretending to be late, baseball cap. oh, god. next time we flew, i went, “where’s that bloke? i’m not queueing!” it’s quick! when i fly to the states, i’ve got a place there, but i’m always working. so, someone else is paying. so, i go first class. ba. it doesn’t get any better. even if i was paying, i’d still go first class, but jane would probably be in coach… it’s ten grand a pop! that new planet of the apes movie’s on. she’ll love that. she’ll be up for that. but when someone else is paying, i say, “jane, get up here with me.” right? front two seats… they board us early. we’re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else. god. they bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. champagne. it’s great. it’s like a day off. no phone or anything. it’s like a holiday, flying to the states.\n",
            "i could do without the safety video. that’s always a bit of a downer. and totally pointless. if you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. imagine if that worked. you’re going down, the plane smashes. you go, “i’ll try it.” you do that. ball of flames, you wake up, everyone’s dead. you go, “fucking hell, that’s amazing, that is!” and they always use that voice, don’t they? that calming, hypnotic voice, like, “nothing bad will happen.” they’re saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because i’m using this voice, don’t worry. things like, “in the event of the plane landing on water–” it smashes the fuck to bits, right? they say, “in the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle.” a fucking whistle. so, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyone’s dead, except you, by a miracle. you’re bobbing around in the atlantic ocean. four degrees, that water is. you’ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in. or you’re eaten by a shark, or you drown. you’re hoping they’ve sent air-sea rescue. you’re going, “god, i’m gonna die, i don’t know what i’m doing!” hold on! i mean, air sea rescue… i don’t know if you’ve ever been in a helicopter. o course you haven’t. but… they’re fucking loud. it’s like having your head in a washing machine. you have to wear ear plugs and defenders. your teeth rattle. it’s like… like that. over the atlantic ocean at night. never gonna happen. if you crash, you die, right? but apart from that, it’s brilliant. right… i was flying heathrow to jfk just before christmas, right? boarded us early, on the plane. she comes round. “champagne in a wine glass, like you like it, mr. gervais.” she goes off. i go, “have you got any of them warm nuts?” she went, “we’re not handing out nuts on this flight. a lady’s getting on who’s so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction.” i went, “oh, my god, of course.” i was fuming. i mean… what’s that got to do with me? why can’t i eat nuts, just cause… fucking… this woman will… die, right? nuts! how has she lived this long? if walking by a nut kills you… if being… just near a nut… how has she never been near a nut… before? and how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? honestly. it’s… and if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? i mean… i never wanted nuts more. i felt she was infringing on my human right to eat nuts. and this is how spoiled i am, okay? i actually had this thought. i thought, “oh, i wish i’d brought my own nuts on.” right?. i thought for a second, but that wouldn’t work. she’d get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? like that… and… die. and someone would go, “ricky gervais brought his own nuts on.” you know, right? so i don’t take my own nuts on. now, before i fly, i have a shower, and then i rub myself all over… in nuts… just in case. then i go, “can i have any nuts?” they go, “no, sorry, this lady would die.” “yeah, not a problem.” lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog… i go, “what’s the matter?” i touch her all over. “what’s the matter?” she goes, “nuts!” right? and dies. and i go, “who’s been eating nuts?” i get off scot-free. so i got to america, i went on a chat show. tonight show with jimmy fallon. and i told that story, the whole thing. it went well, audience laughed. great. went out. next day on twitter, outrage. by “outrage”, i mean one person going, “how dare you?” this woman goes, “i saw you on jimmy fallon, making fun of nut allergies. my daughter’s nut-intolerant. how dare you?” i go, “who is this woman?” she’s tweeted 15 times. she starts @-ing nbc and jimmy fallon. i go, “what’s this? how many followers? twenty-three. ignore it.” you know when you’re being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, “so, you find so and so funny?” and cause the teacher’s really angry, yes, you do find that thing funny, whatever… she said… “would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog?” yeah. yeah, you saying that… yes. if you said that at the funeral, i would, yeah… so, someone else gets involved. ohio moms against nuts, right? and she does a blog, and they’re talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting i am. one filmed her little girl, put it on youtube, and sent me it. i opened it. sweet little girl, seven years old. and she went, “dear mr. gervais, i have a fatal nut allergy.” delete. not my problem, right? ignore. ignore. ignore. right? but then one of them said something that reeled me in. just cause i’m this self-confessed twitter police. i try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. a joke about a bad thing isn’t as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. it could be anti the bad thing. it depends on the actual joke. and this woman said… “you should never make jokes about food allergies.” i should have left it, right? i sent back, “i make jokes about aids, cancer, famine, and the holocaust. and you’re telling me i should never joke about food allergies?” she sent back, “yes, but the holocaust didn’t kill children.” well… it did, didn’t it? it was horrible, the holocaust. some would say as bad as food allergies. “didn’t kill children…” jesus. it did kill children. hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. i have to say, hitler, you couldn’t make him up. the worst human being to walk the face of the earth. he is a crazy… evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. just terrible. but… if i was throwing a dinner party, and i’d been slaving over a hot stove, and i was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and i had to… either invite hitler or that little girl with food allergies… i know who’d ruin that party more. everyone’s enjoying it. “everything okay?” “ja, ist yummy!” right? he’s loving it. i go, “cheers, you fucker! how you doing, boy?” she’s going, “i can’t eat that.” fucking hell. “who wants ferrero rocher?” “me!” “all right. here!” “i can’t eat them.” oh, fuck off home. right?\n",
            "that’s what the world’s like. people see something they don’t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. they want us to care about their thing as much as they do. it’s why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. i think i’ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity… 1965 to 2015, the peak of civilization, for everything. for tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. now it’s going the other way a bit. last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe. i’m not saying this because i’m old. old people say things like, “oh, everything was better when i was a kid.” course it was. you were a kid. everything’s better when you’re a kid. being old is the shit bit. whatever’s happening, being old is… i wake up these days, and i go, “oh fuck, i didn’t die.” gotta do it all again. i’m usually hung over, headache, liver pains. i can’t walk for the first five minutes, ’cause i’ve got no joints in my knees. i’m getting fat again now, right? i was thin till i was about 28, proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. then i got a job, right? and the next, sort of, 20 years were what i call my eating years… and i just got steadily fatter and fatter. until i reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when i was about 48 years old. there was one christmas, i was at home, lying on the floor… and… i was saying to jane, “i’m having a heart attack.” right? and, honestly, my heart rate was like 130. i felt nauseous, i had palpitations, i was sweating. because i’d eaten eleven sausages. true story, right? i was like one of them snakes. like when you see a big, like… python swallow a pig whole. and then it’s just fucked. it’s, like… it’ll sit there for a week. it’s like a duffel bag. just there, like that. that was me, right? i wasn’t having a heart attack, but it worried jane. she said, “you gotta look after yourself.” i thought, “you’re right. 48.” so i started working out, right, every day. i didn’t give anything up. i don’t eat meat anymore. but i was having 2500, 3000 calories a day, including wine every night. but i burnt it off the next day. just so i could do all that, i worked out every day, running, weight training… i had more time on my hands than the average person. i had a gym in my house, i had no excuse. i lost 20 pounds. it was great. but now, i still eat and drink too much, but i physically can’t… burn off the calories. i can’t do enough. cause i’m so old and broken and tired. so, i’m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time i am going to die. i’m losing my hair. it’s getting really thin. i know it looks great from there. cheers, but… no, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? i’ll have to buzz that off soon. i’d never wear a wig, oh, my god. if you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think you’ve got away with it… you haven’t. everyone knows. everyone knows immediately. my brain knows a wig has come into the room before i do, right? i could be at a party, it’ll go, “there’s a wig in here.” -i go. “is there?” -“yes! there is, yeah!” spidey senses for the wig. it’s obvious. the way they smile, like nothing’s wrong. hiya. it’s the telltale signs, isn’t it? i was put off wigs for life by my uncle reginald. great bloke. he’s dead now. died a few years ago. i was only little. he went bald in his twenties. tragically bald. his hair fell out. it might have been something like alopecia. but he was bald for ten years into his thirties. turns up one day at our house… “elvis! what is–” i was about eight, i said to auntie edna, “what happened?” she went, “it was a miracle.” they were lying! they were just… everyone knew he was bald! but he’d embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. they’re going, “yeah, it just grew back.” there’s so much he wouldn’t do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. we weren’t allowed balloons at parties, right? auntie edna said, “reg is allergic to balloons.” he wasn’t allergic. he was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. we’ve got photos in the family album. if he’s at a wedding or a christening, and he’s holding a baby, it’s always at arms’ length. like that. so it can’t grab his wig. it must have been on his mind all the time, right? it was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. he was in the army, hard as nails. he wasn’t scared of anyone or anything. spiders, snakes… cancer… how’s the chemo going, uncle? “not a problem.” we’ve got a photo of him, the last year, i think. he was 75. it must have been the last year he was alive. it was a hot day. he was in the garden. in his little trunks. he was a wizened little man by then. white chest hair. jet black wig still! died in it, buried in it. he’s wearing it now. a little skeleton with jet black hair. like posh spice for eternity. but i knew that was gonna happen. i knew i would get old and fat and… ill and blind and deaf and… shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. you’re ready, because you’re warned. you know about getting old. what they don’t talk about, so you’re not prepared, and it was a shock to me… i only found out recently, i’ll share it with you now. the distending testicles. see, you don’t know about it. but it happens in your fifties. i wasn’t checking them or anything… i didn’t see ’em for 20 years. as a young man, they were pert, and now they’re like two plums in a sock. i don’t know when it happened, but it was recently. they just… and this is how i found out. so, as i’ve been getting older, and they’ve been secretly stretching away… as i’ve got older, i’ve got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. last year, i moved into a new house in hampstead. big bath. big sunken bath. south-facing windows. i was in there the first night. lovely bath. sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. i looked down. and they’re floating. right? now, i’d never dreamt that testicles would float. they seem like they’d be heavy. you could tie things down with them, and they’d sink. you know? most people never see their… in the sea, you’re in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths aren’t usually that deep! that was my first thought. “oh, my god, i never thought testicles would float.” then my second thought kicked in. “hold on, this bath’s two feet deep!” right? i’m sitting on the bottom, they’re on top. what’s going on? right? and… i looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. easily, by some way, right? in fact, they’d created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? my penis was dry, just nestled, just… floating on top. like that. like that. just bouncing around. i should have given it a little whistle. i’m just thinking, “this is bizarre.” fucking hell, right? and… i thought, “maybe it’s a fluke.” so i held them under the water for a minute, i let them go and they bobbed up! they’re really… they’re really buoyant, right? try it when you get home, if you’re in your 50s. and a man, obviously. or caitlyn jenner. but… but the world is getting worse. and i blame the beginning of its demise on social media. because twitter and facebook, that’s where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. everything was “like me”, “agree with me”. it falls into two tribes. “i don’t agree with them, so i block them.” and now, in this post-truth era, people don’t care about the argument, they say, “who’s saying the argument? no, they’re not on our side.” it’s ludicrous, okay? and it also bred this ridiculous notion we’ve always had. my opinion is worth as much as yours. now, it’s my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. i get tweets from people saying, “i believe the earth is 6,000 years old.” “i believe you’re a fucking idiot.” you can’t have an opinion on the age of the earth. you can have opinions, but not your own facts. but it was all about being popular, right? and even politicians picked up those symptoms. politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. we had a brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. they didn’t want to make a mistake. and there’s a ridiculous thing of, “let’s ask the average person what they think.” let’s stop asking the average person what they… do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? we still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say “do not drink”. right? let’s take those labels off, right? for two years. and then have a referendum. but it’s not just politicians. even real news. the news on tv says things like, “tweet us your news.” don’t let them tweet you the news! -“i saw a tyrannosaurus rex.” -you liar! right? there was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. the results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. he said, “we’ve looked at everything, and we’ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so we’re going to slow them down a bit. statistically, this shouldn’t happen again.” that would have been it. but the guy went, “we asked the public what they thought.” then there was three banal vox pops. first one said, “i already pay £960 a year, so i’m not happy.” the next one said, “it takes me 45 minutes each way, it’s not good enough.” the last one said, “i say it’s better to arrive at work late than dead.” why is that on the news? and when is that applicable in any situation? all right, ted? you’re in early. ted? oh, ted! we’ve been through this. remember i said i’d rather you arrive late than dead? but… the big enemy is stupidity… right? i wanna share with you the most stupid tweet i ever got. now, admittedly, when i first got on twitter, i pushed my agenda. i was an outspoken atheist. not to change anyone’s opinions. i thought it was important to tell the other side. there are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. i just wanted to say, “it’s fine to be an atheist. it’s fine to believe in god, and it’s fine not to.” that’s all i was saying. i realized i didn’t have to tweet about religion or atheism. i could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. i’d tweet things like “happy birthday, earth. four point six billion years old today.” someone would always go, “we know what you’re fucking doing.” this is a tweet i got after one of those. and… it was all in capitals, which excited me… that’s the sign of twitter madness. mixed with anger. it’s great, right? i looked at his profile. sure enough, he’s a gentleman from texas. he’s a fundamentalist, creationist christian. which is fine! he loves god. he loves god and… fetuses, mainly. he loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then he’s… remember it’s in capitals. he’s shouting at me. best tweet ever. “your science–” my science, right? science, by the way, is spelled s-c-i-e-n-t-s. already good, isn’t it? i mean… he’s obviously heard the word, he took a guess… never seen it written down, because it’s not in the bible. so he’s… “your scients won’t help you… well, it will. it’s helping him… beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. “your scients won’t help you when satan…” of course he believes in satan. why not? he believes that god made the universe in six days. you’re not gonna say to him, “do you believe in satan?” and have him say, “bit far-fetched.” why doesn’t god kill satan? that’s… what i’d ask him. if i was wrong and i met god, i’d go, “oh, you do exist.” he’d go, “yeah.” i’d go, “i’ve got a few fucking questions, mate. the first one would be, “why did you make chocolate kill dogs?” mental, right? also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male g-spot up the arse? what… what is wrong with you? then i’d say, “why don’t you kill satan?” and he’d go, “what?” i’d go, “why don’t you kill satan? if he does all the bad stuff and you do all the good stuff, which you want… i mean, you do want–” “yes, yeah.” “you could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy.” “yeah.” “why don’t you kill him, then?” “because… shut up.” “your scients won’t help you when satan is raping your british ass.” and he’s got a point. because if i die, and i find myself in hell, being raped by satan… science has pretty much let me down. but it’s this last line that he just throws away. the line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet i’ve ever received. “your scients won’t help you when satan is raping your british ass. i’ll be laughing.” so… he’s there too! he’s… so, he’s a fundamentalist… christian, who’s lived his life by the old and new testaments. he dies, he wakes up in hell, right? which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma… “oh, my god, i’m in hell! oh, my god, why have you forsaken me? i’m gonna be tortured for eternity!” he sees me getting raped and goes, “ha, ha, ha!” he’s suddenly over it, is he? his day’s suddenly got a little bit brighter. and like he’s not next, right? so i’m getting raped, right, by the devil, right? he’s just there. “you fucking atheist scum.” and i’m like that. “yeah, whatever.” i assume it happens all eternity. “yeah, yeah, whatever.” like that. i might say, “watch your hooves on my testicles.” and he’d go, “why are they so distended?” and i go, “oh, like you’re brad pitt!” you know what i mean? sorry, are we talking or raping? can we… “you lying, fucking atheist.” he’s probably bored. “fucking atheists. every fucking day.” right? his little gargoyle comes up. “satan?” he goes, “what?” and i go, “yeah? what?” he goes, “there’s a fundamentalist christian.” “fuck this!” he’d be on him like a ton of bricks! so… i got that tweet. i loved it. all i did was re-tweet, right? and just watch the fun, people piling on, going, “ah, loser!” and he’s fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, “go fuck your sister, you english faggot!” that makes no sense at all. i forgot about it. went and did something else. few hours later, on twitter again. it’s still all going off, right? it’s really funny, i’m laughing at all the replies. people saying things to him. i’m scrolling down. there’s one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. she says, “you find rape funny?” no! no! what? no… “your mates find rape funny?” no! listen, right? “you find rape funny?” listen, everyone! listen, right? no… i said to her, “i didn’t tweet that.” -she went, “you retweeted it.” -to show he’s an idiot. “but you must find it funny or amusing. it’s not a frivolous thing.” i said, “no, well, it’s up to him, isn’t it? he can do it.” now i’m arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. but i’m fighting for his right… to fantasize about me being raped by the devil. because i’m so conscious of “freedom of speech”… what a topsy-turvy world, right? although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. because she did that thing that people do. she didn’t say, “what, you find jokes about rape funny?” she said, “what, you find rape funny?” the answer to that is, no, of course not. no one finds rape funny. not even rapists find rape funny, know what i mean? noone ever gives evidence saying, “it was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling.” that’s never… so… i sent back, “you mean jokes about rape?” she said, “yes.” -i went, “depends on the joke.” “-it fucking doesn’t!” i’m going, “no, it does! it does! it depends on the joke. it’s about context, it’s about content. what do you mean by a rape joke?” she said, “even a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it is unacceptable.” i said, “that’s ridiculous, it depends what the joke is.” i tweeted that clip of me in the office, going, “i think there’s been a rape up there!” everyone gets that because of the context. and the target is a middle-aged man, who’s so narcissistic, he’ll say anything to win a silly game. you have to understand the joke and where it comes from. i said, “some jokes don’t punch up or down. they don’t punch anywhere. they can just be a pun, a play on words, that don’t really mean anything.” a joke went round when i was a kid, even adults told it. i’ll tell you. a woman goes running into a police station. she says, “help, i’ve been graped!” the policeman says, “do you mean raped?” she says, “no, there was a bunch of them.” that is a rape joke, right? so…. and i even said to her, “no, i agree, in most cases, yeah. real rape jokes, they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. disgusting! i’d never tell those. but it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject.” i calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. she ended it by saying, “well, okay, i see your point, but… still… i will laugh at a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped.” i should have left it. i just sent back, “what a weird door policy.” you turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, “can i just ask you a question?” yeah. have you ever been raped? i have, yes. you can’t come in. what? why? a lady says she won’t laugh if you’re in. off you go. that’s what the world is like. people take everything personally. they think the world revolves around them, particularly on twitter. i’m not tweeting anyone, i’m just tweeting. i don’t know who’s following me. i’ve got 12 million followers. they can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. that’s like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying “guitar lessons”, and you go, “but i don’t fucking want guitar lessons!” what’s this? there’s a number here. right, call that. are you giving guitar lessons? i don’t fucking want any! fine! it’s not for you, then. just walk away. don’t worry about it.\n",
            "i should say one thing in twitter’s defense. i use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. but one great thing about twitter, for me, personally, i’m very into anti animal cruelty. years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. standing outside tesco’s or something. that’s the magic number, because then it gets heard in parliament. i’ve been part of many campaigns through twitter when we’ve got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. thank you to those who’ve retweeted about animal cruelty. it makes a difference. thank you. but even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, you think no one’s gonna argue with that. yes, they will. they just wanna be heard. i’ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. i say, “ban bullfighting.” someone always says, “what about the kids in syria?” what? well, i’m not giving you a choice. you can do both. i’m not saying, “throw that kid back in the hole, there’s a bull here!” and there’s one thing that i didn’t want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that i found out, through twitter. there’s a thing called the yulin dog meat festival, in china, every year. and it’s horrendous. and we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. it’s a drop in the ocean. they eat thousands over this weekend. i tweet the details, the petition, people don’t really read it. it’s a knee-jerk. people say, “racist!” i go, “what?” they go, “we eat pigs and cows in the west.” yep, we do. i don’t but, yeah, i used to. you’re right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. it’s not about the species. it’s what they do to these poor dogs. what they do is torture the dogs first. ‘cause they think it makes the meat taste better. they beat them, they blowtorch them. they even skin them alive. and i saw this picture… on twitter of the opening of this ceremony. these two guys, in this chinese square, and they’re skinning this dog alive. it’s screaming, they’re laughing. it’s the worst thing i’ve ever seen. i thought, “i’ve got to tweet that.” i tweeted the picture, with a petition, and i just said, “one beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive.” right? and it took off. loads of retweets, it made the press. i got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, “is that language necessary?” i should have left it, right? but i was… i was incensed! i said, “you’re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death?” she said, “i just hate the c-word.” i definitely should have left it. i sent back, “people who hate the c-word would hear it a lot less, if they didn’t go round acting like such cunts.” thank you! you’ve been fantastic! good night! cheers! thank you so much! thank you so much. i hope you enjoyed the show. i hope no-one was offended. no, i really do! that’s not the point. i’ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad people. i think it’s my upbringing. i grew up… in poverty, with nothing. but the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. that was the men. the women carried on working. it was my older brother, bob, it was him who i first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. people were laughing. i realized, “he’s healing them.” that’s what comedy’s for, what humor’s for. it gets us over bad stuff. right? typical bob story. he once spent an hour in the pound shop in hayling island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. just to see if he could break this poor man’s will. bob was the first person i saw answer back to authority. the first authority you come across are your parents. and he’d get in trouble. he got sent to bed. but i thought he’d won the argument. and he’d tease my mum. my mum was a typical working-class woman. as i say, we lived in a shitty area, right? and most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. she mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. she thought, “if it looked respectable, we’d be respectable.” it was about reputation, i guess. bob would send her postcards that just read, “is that pedophile postman still reading your mail?” and she’d take it, she’d go in, and she’d be horrified. she’d call bob. “he saw it this time, you must stop doing that!” even at her funeral… my mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. at mum’s funeral, we had different duties. i did catering and flowers. bob went to see the local vicar. that was a mistake, right? we’d never been to church, he didn’t know us, we didn’t know him. so, he said to bob, “tell me about your mum, so i can say a few words.” bob saw that as an opportunity, right? so, bob, with a straight face, said, “well, she was a keen racist.” the vicar went, “i can’t say that.” bob said, “okay, put she liked gardening.” he was trying to get the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. he didn’t warn us. and he did get something by the vicar. so we’re called ricky, robert– bob– ricky, robert, marsha and larry. now, larry is the oldest, in his seventies. born in the war. i always thought he was the sensible one. first born, weight of the world on his shoulders. my mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. he’s a stand-up guy, larry. so, bob… gives the vicar the wrong name. didn’t warn us. we’re all in church. start of the funeral, we’re all there. packed out. the coffin comes down. guided by the vicar. the vicar goes to his pulpit. all confident, with his little notes, right? and he goes… eva leaves behind four loving children. ricky. robert. marsha. and barry. and… we snort like that, right? bob’s going… everyone realizes. we’re all laughing. we see larry go… all right. and the church is like… every time we thought of it, we’d see larry go… like that, right? then we’d just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? larry eventually started doing this. and the vicar’s thinking, “what have i said?” right? he’d put in a few things the vicar didn’t know that set us off again. things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. my nieces and nephews started crying. i’d come prepared with a pack of tissues. they’d take one and hand it on. before the funeral, i’d taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. and each tissue said, “snivelling fucking bitch.” and they’re sort of laughing. so it was like a madhouse, right? everything the vicar said or did, we all started fucking laughing! right? and you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. he ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and bob. he said, “sorry, was that okay?” me and bob went, “fucking brilliant, mate. it was fucking brilliant.” that’s what i mean. we’re all gonna die, so we should have a laugh. if you can laugh in the face of adversity, you’re bullet-proof. me and my brother, bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, you’ve got to say it. win, lose or draw. it might go well… it might go badly. but you’ve gotta say it. and bear that in mind, as i leave you with this. right… so… we’re all in the car one day. bob’s driving. packed in this car. a little day trip to the beach. we get stopped for a security check. and there’s a british bobby there. and he stops the car. bob’s at the window. he said, “where are we off to?” bob went, “bognor.” he went, “can you just pop the boot, please?” so he looks at that. looks in the boot, like that. back to bob’s window. gets that mirror on a stick thing. and he starts just looking under the car. and as he does that, his helmet falls off, right? and out of the helmet falls a packet of 20 cigarettes. and the copper went, “bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets.” and bob went, “i knew it wasn’t fucking brains.” you’ve been amazing. good night! prolefeed. your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * \n",

            "hello. hello! how you doing? great. thank you. wow. calm down. shut the fuck up. thank you. what a lovely welcome. i’m gonna try my hardest tonight. you’re thinking, “relax, we’ve had our money’s worth just seeing you.” what? you’re a legend. shut up! what is he? i’m not a god. i’m just an ordinary guy, you know, going round talking to people sort… sort of like jesus… in a way… but better. well, i’ve actually turned up. so… thank you and welcome to my new show, humanity. i don’t know why i called it that. i’m not a big fan. i prefer dogs… obviously. dogs are better people than people, aren’t they? they’re amazing, dogs. they’re our best friends. they guard us, they guide us. there’s medical detection dogs that can smell if you’ve got… aids. i’m not a doctor… but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so they go, “cor, you’re well hiv! fuck!” you know? and you go, “you can smell aids on someone?” yeah. “why didn’t you smell it on the bloke i brought home last night, you fucking idiot?” they did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. then we got involved and did some selective breeding. getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. bit stronger, faster, whatever. they’re great at the jobs they’re bred to do. they love the job they’re bred to do. they’re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. although, the rhodesian ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. i can’t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. so we’ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. a big passing-out parade. there’s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. he goes, “right, dogs!” they go, “what?” “who wants to know what job they got?” “we all do. we all do.” “okay, labradors.” “yeah?” “do you like carefully bringing back dead ducks?” “yeah?” “that’s your job.” “amazing. that is amazing. that is my favorite job. that is my favorite job.” “jack russells?” -“yeah?” -“you like shooting down rabbit holes?” -“yeah!” -“that’s your job.” “fuckin’ hell. best day ever! best day ever!” -“miniature poodles?” -“yeah?” “do you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals?” -“yeah.” -“that’s your job.” that’s your job. “ridgebacks?” “yo!” “you’re hunting lions.” “what?” “you’re hunting lions.” “fuck off!” -“yeah, you are.” -“no, we’re not. look, lions? we’ll get fucking mashed! why can’t the rottweilers hunt lions?” “they’re shaking babies.” good boy! good boy! you shake that baby if you want. good boy! cheers. this is my first new stand-up for seven years, if you don’t count the golden globes. which you shouldn’t. the golden globes. very different. god, a different vibe. two hundred million people watching. and it’s live. big thrill. but with that many people watching, there’s a bit of stick. everyone’s different, everyone’s a blogger. everyone goes, “i was offended.” -“why?” -“he said an horrible thing.” “he said loads of horrible things.” “yeah, but that was a thing that i care about.” that’s the thing about offense, it’s about personal feelings. i don’t care about the backlash. “comedian in hot water.” you know? my girlfriend, jane, she worries, and she reads things. “what have you said?” “don’t worry. they won’t come to the house. fuck ’em.” so i wind her up. i pretend i’m gonna say much worse things than i ever would. i have to make up worse jokes than i actually… just to scare my girlfriend. when i do the golden globes, we go out about a week before. it’s in la. we fly out. i’m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. they release more presenters. i take my pick. “i got a good intro for them. yeah. mel gibson? i’ll introduce him, yes.” about three days before this last one, just to wind jane up, i said, “i got a good intro.” she went, “what?” i said, “bill cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. please welcome helen mirren!” i didn’t do it. she said, “you won’t do that?” i said, “no.” next day, i got her again. i said, “is this too much?” i said, “not even bill cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. please welcome melissa mccarthy!” i didn’t do it! i would never… i’d never… tell a joke like that. it’s horrible. i was just doing it to annoy jane. i’d never even… think… of that, so don’t… even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, i said, “i’ll start with a funny one-liner. an old-fashioned joke.” she went, “what?” i said, “what did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for christmas?” jane went, “i don’t know.” i said, “cancer.” i didn’t do it, so… you’re getting offended at a joke that doesn’t exist, so… i’d never say that in public, so… to anyone who mattered, anyway. so, don’t… i didn’t have to worry about offending anyone. it just happens. the big controversy last time i did it was a caitlyn jenner joke. outrage on twitter the next day. i mean a couple of people going, “it was transphobic.” it wasn’t transphobic in the slightest. it was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. and that’s the other thing about offense. people mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. they’re not necessarily the same. i’ll tell you the joke, you make your minds up. it’s live, so they go, “your host for the 68th annual golden globes awards, please welcome ricky gervais.” they’re all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. nervously. it’s brilliant, right? so, i just go, “relax, i’m gonna be nice tonight. i’ve changed. not as much as bruce jenner, obviously.” and i go, “now caitlyn jenner, of course.” and what a year she’s had. became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. she didn’t do a lot for women drivers…” that’s a clever joke. i’ll tell you why. right? it’s layered. no, listen, right? the subject of that joke is stereotypes. i’m playing with the notion of stereotypes. i start by saying she’s a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. then if she’s a real woman, i hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. she must be a bad driver, then. right? the target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. let’s not forget that, shall we? a celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. that’s… the target of the joke, just so we’re clear. okay? she was interviewed a week later at a press conference for a show of hers. now cancelled. and… one of the press said, “what do you think of the ricky gervais joke?” she went, “maybe i should host the golden globes.” and they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. it was clickbait. i rose to the bait. obviously… i just sent back, “let her host. just don’t let her drive.” another website that was in the room, entertainment weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. their headline was “caitlyn finally breaks silence over ricky gervais.” i just sent back: “at last. she always brakes too late.” bring it on. bring it on. but i’m a considered comedian. i like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. so i was engaging these people, saying, “why is it transphobic?” they said, “it’s about a trans person.” that’s ridiculous. that’s like saying a joke about bill cosby is automatically racist. it depends on the joke. but i’m willing to learn. i found out my crime was that i dead-named her. i’d never heard that term before a day after the golden globes. and that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. but she did! i saw him on the olympic games! he was a decathlete, he was in everything! all over the place! shot put and pole vault. he won a medal! he was famous! he was on telly all the time, you know? a big… famous… man. with a huge… i don’t know. i’m guessing. probably. he was big. but i’ve learnt my lesson. now i know it’s wrong. i’d never dead-name her now. but, years ago, when she was a… man… years ago, i’m saying. and she went to the… doctor… and… knocked on the door. the doctor went, “come in!” this is years ago. i’d never dead-name her now, but this is like… a flashback before anyone… you know what… so… so, like, “come in!” and he went, “hello, bruce jenner.” because that… that was his name… then. the doctor– this was years ago… the doctor went, “all right, bruce jenner, how you doing, you fucker? you big old lunk. how you doing? come here, you, you fucker. how you doing, brucie boy?” and bruce jenner– that was his name. this is years ago. right? so… bruce jenner went, “yeah. yeah, not too bad, doctor. yeah.” “what can i do for you, bruce, you fucker? how you doing, boy?” and bruce jenner went– that was his name. bruce jenner went… “look at that.” the doctor went, “come on, bruce jenner, you know the rules.” he uses his whole name every time, for some reason… “come on, bruce jenner, you fucker. you know the rules. you can’t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate.” bruce jenner went, “no, that’s not my pole, that’s my enormous penis.” “well, seeing as it’s your penis, you can bring it in here. but you should have left your shot puts outside.” and bruce jenner went… that was his name for… fifty-eight years, i think. he went, “no, they’re not my shot puts, doctor, they’re my enormous testicles.” that’s where i keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? and the doctor went, “oh yeah. that makes perfect– i’m a medical man. you’re a big bloke. you fucker. how you doing, boy? you’re a big… you’re big, and you would have a big old… cock and… balls. they’re beautiful.” bit familiar, innit? “no, you must be very proud of them, bruce.” bruce went, “this is going to surprise you, doctor. i wanna get rid of them.” and the doctor went, “what? why?” “oh, they get in the way.” “in the way of what?” “fucking driving, for one thing!” so, i’m engaging these people, and i’m saying, “but i had to say her old name. that’s the joke. i say, “i’ve changed. not as much as bruce jenner.” then i do the joke.” but, no. this is my second crime. i say, she hasn’t changed. she’s always identified as a woman. that means she’s a woman. fine, if that’s the rules. if you feel you’re a woman, you are. i’m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. in fact, i don’t think it’s going far enough. cause i’ve always identified as a chimp, right? well, i am a chimp. if i say i’m a chimp, i am a chimp. pre-op. but… don’t ever dead-name me. don’t call me ricky gervais again. from now on, you call me bobo. i’m gonna have species realignment. i’m halfway there. i’m short, with short legs and long arms. i stoop. my back’s getting hairier by the day. i’ve got fangs, like that. i love nuts. i love nuts. once, i was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so i just started masturbating, like… so… i am a chimp, right? i am a chimp if i say i’m a chimp. i’ve got to live as a chimp for a year. then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. that’d be lovely. i’m gonna stay a male chimp… so i can keep all that, right? male, heterosexual chimp. keep the same girlfriend. jane would be happy. she loves me, she loves chimps, so… you know. i reckon that’s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, we’re so close, than for a man to turn into a woman, in many ways. a bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off… and a hole gouged out, into– i’m not a doctor! but that is… the gist of it. i know which one i’d rather have done. i’m not saying chimps are better than women. no way. right? any ladies here? i can’t see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equal… to a chimp. so… so, i’d have all that done, hair and that. i’d do all that, all the… i’ll retain the ability to speak english. like in emergencies. i’m talking to jane, she’s going, “what is it?” “what is it, bobo?” “you left the fucking oven on! there’s a fire!” are you saying that if caitlyn jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, she’d… revert. she’d be over that fucking… easy. so i’d have all that done. top lip. doing all that. right? i’ll be legally a chimp. i’ll be well… properly chimped-up. i’ll be able to use chimp toilets! i’ll be walking along, holding jane’s hand. “come on, bobo.” right? we don’t hold hands now. i don’t know why she’s all over me now i’m a chimp. but we’ll be all in love. maybe matching jumpers. “come on, bobo.” in love. just two… like that. then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, “that’s fucking disgusting.” i’ll fling shit at him and run up a tree. and that’s why that joke isn’t transphobic. so… cheers. so, humanity. what is humanity? what are we? well, we’ve touched upon it there. we’re great apes. not metaphorically! we’re literally great apes. we are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. we’re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. we left our common ancestor about six million years ago. we have the same life cycle. same as any other animal. which is… our parents mate… we’re born… we grow… we mate… our parents die… our friends die… and then we die. now… my seven-year-old niece didn’t like hearing that. but i said, “you’ve gotta learn. stop crying.” i said, “you’re seven. you know… today. so… any more grizzling and this party’s cancelled, so…” let’s take the first of those. birth. it’s odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. i mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. that’s why the skull is in parts and supple. then we go on gestating outside the womb. that’s why we’re so useless. look at other mammals. a giraffe is walking along. it goes, “i’m proper pregnant.” right? i’m gonna have a baby giraffe right here. yeah, there it is. see you later. and the baby goes, “mum!” it’s got to be fucking ready. we’re… we’re helpless, right? just think, nine months we’re growing in this perfect environment. everything’s… it’s like being in a little kate bush video, right? then, suddenly, you’re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. you’re covered in shit, there’s screaming. you go, “i can’t breathe.” someone goes, “yes, you fucking can!” the first one second of life on earth. you don’t know where you are. you can’t choose where you’re born. i was born in whitley estate in reading, right? i wouldn’t have chosen that. i’d have chosen hampstead. i did choose hampstead. it just took 45 years to be able to afford it. very different. very different, my upbringing to how i live now. now i live a privileged life. hampstead is ridiculous. it’s a rarefied place. it’s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? but, growing up, it was tough! i don’t know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. it felt like wildlife. i was weak and vulnerable. there was danger round every corner. my school was on my street and i ran there every day, so i didn’t get mugged or molested. there weren’t many pedophiles in reading, the murderers had killed a lot. but there was still a couple. i moved to hampstead. oh my god! there’s no crime! i saw a knife once in hampstead. it was a palette knife. just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him “bender”. it was weird! i know my life has changed drastically, it wasn’t always like that. as a famous person, you read about yourself. gossip and twitter and everything. one thing kept cropping up, even as i prepared for this tour. people kept saying, “he’s out of touch. he’s so famous. he’s rich. he’s mega-rich.” i am. right? i could have this place burnt down for a laugh. no, but they say things like, “he’s an observational comedian. how can he say things that relate to ordinary… scum.” and i say.. i say, “don’t call them scum, right?” but even the papers, they try and… get around to it. i do interviews and they’ll always say, “do you always fly first class?” i go, “no. often private.” right? the number of times i’ve answered this question. they say, “do you know how much a pint of milk is?” to make you look out of touch. i don’t know, but that’s irrelevant. next time a journalist asks me, i’ll say, “i don’t know. but here’s a grand. run and get me one.” is that enough? that enough? yeah. another question i always get, particularly with the posh sundays, doing a profile piece. they’re still trying to alienate you, make you look different. they say things like, “you don’t have children.” i say, “no.” “why don’t you have children?” which is an odd question. why don’t you have children? as opposed to asking people, “why do you have children?” let’s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she’s had eight, shall we? nine! that one just fell out. that one didn’t even touch the sides. or… disturb her cigarette. that one just… go and claim for that. people say it’s selfish to not have children. how is it selfish to not bring a life into the world that doesn’t exist on any level? there’s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, “we want to be born!” right? but i’ve thought about it and there’s three reasons i don’t have children. three main reasons and i’ll share them with you. three reasons. one. there’s millions! the world’s over-populated. no-one’s going, “rick’s not having kids. we’re gonna run out. fuck.” two. kids are scroungers. aren’t they? i mean, from day one, it’s all “me, me, me”, isn’t it? “feed me.” “clothe me.” “pay for my chemotherapy.” no… no. not my problem, son. not mine. luck of the draw, boy. luck of the draw. it costs the average household in the west $200,000 to bring up a child. and they don’t want to pay you back. they’re not grateful. they don’t go, “thanks for having me.” it’s “i didn’t wanna be born.” even if they get a top job, which they won’t, you’ll never see that money back. they’ll just put you in a home, okay? and my kid, he’d be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldn’t he? so… he’d be a little cunt. a little hampstead cunt… running around with all the other fucking little hampstead cunts, being all hampstead and cunty. “i’m a little hampstead cunt.” yes, i know. “these are my cunty friends.” i know, it’s obvious. i can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you’re little hampstead cunts, you little posh hampstead… first, he’d know he was a little hampstead cunt. “i’m a little…” yes, we know. everyone knows, right? he’d know that, right? on the other hand, he’d know he’d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. i’d say, “i worked my way up from nothing, and you’re just a useless hampstead cunt.” he’d go, “yeah.” and that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. eleven, twelve, he’d be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. then he’d turn to drugs. about 30, he’d come home, and overdose on my afghan rug. twenty grand, that was, right? and as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle… his little fucking dying words, he’d go, “do you love me now, daddy?” no! no. no, i never did. that’s why you’ll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, hampstead cunt. and, three… i’d worry sick about him. you know? no i would! i’ve only got a cat now and i worry sick about her. i check the door three times when i go out, so she doesn’t escape. i put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she’s peckish. a human baby? oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? i’d watch it sleep. you know? we said how weak and vulnerable they are. oh, my god! you perfect little thing. oh, you flesh of my flesh. now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. night, night. sleep tight. don’t let the bedbugs… dead. yeah. just… why? why is it dead? it’s just fucking dead, look! fuck’s sake! fucking hell. what the… what a fucking waste of time that was! fuck’s sake. embarrassing. “jane?” -“what?” -“come here.” -“i’m in the shower.” -“come here.” “what?” “fucking dead already. i didn’t… just fucking… fucking hell, jane. you call that a baby? that is…” if jane was out, i’d have to text her, wouldn’t i? what could you… “baby’s dead.” she’d come back. “what the fuck?” i’d go, “yep… forget the pampers. lol.” but even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. i’d have to pad them so it didn’t run into it, cave its head in and die. then social services come round and say, “is this your child, mr. gervais?” -“yeah.” -“what happened here, then?” i go, “it’s a fucking idiot.” i did think of adopting for a while. a little third world child. because that would tick all three boxes. one, i wouldn’t be adding to the population problem. i’d be alleviating an existing problem. a young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, i can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. right? two. he would be grateful, wouldn’t he? he’d wanna pay me back, woudn’t he? particularly if i let him know the other kids in the village weren’t so lucky. they didn’t… they didn’t make it out. right? i’d tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. i’d go, “tunde, come here. come here. yeah, yeah. go and pop a shirt on, you’re not in africa now. that’s better. yeah. tunde, look– yeah! water straight out of a tap, innit? yes! yeah. yeah! no, it’s not free. it’s hampstead, you know, but… yeah, course it’s safe. safe, fresh drinking water. have as much as you want. have a bucket full. fresh drinking water. there you go. go and clean the car. go on.” no, i’d go, “look. remember all your friends in the village back in africa? they’re all dead. a rich man didn’t save them and bring them to hampstead. -do you wanna pay me back?” -“yeah.” “yeah, i bet you do.” the good thing about them is, they can start work when they’re about… six. i just call up nike and i go… “do you still make your stuff in sweatshops? got a great little worker here, yeah. pound a day’s fine. he’s gotta start somewhere. and, three… if he ran round and caved his head in… and died, and social services came round and said, “is this your child, mr gervais?” i’d go, “does it look like mine?” i’d go… “this is hampstead. it’s obviously broken in.” that’s why i don’t have kids. even though i don’t have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like i give a shit. i don’t mean my own family. they’ve given up. i’ve got older brothers and sisters. they’ve had loads of kids. and their kids have kids, and then their kids! there’s about 50. i don’t know all their names. i see them at christmas. it’s all “uncle ricky!” they know i’ve got a bit of cash. they go through my pockets, and then fuck off. it’s like being mugged by mice, right? i don’t mean them, i mean strangers. i could be busy, i could be working, like on the set of a tv or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. you get someone who’s in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. “good. be with you in a minute.” then they hover. -“busy?” -i go, “yeah! yes. yeah.” they go, “working the weekend?” i go, “not filming, but i’ll be in the edit.” “i’m taking my youngest to ballet lessons.” “ah. great. great.” “yeah, she’s eight.” “i’ve got a photograph.” i go, “you know what? show me it if she goes missing. i’ll keep an eye open in the woods.” you’ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, “she’s beautiful.” it’s gotta be long. too short, it’s awkward. they know. you go, “yeah, right.” too long and it’s like, “she’s… she’s fucking beautiful.” it’s a minefield, innit? so… i’m not out of touch. but i am spoiled. there’s a difference. i didn’t have any money until i was 40. i’ve got the same family, friends and values. but i am spoiled. because opportunity and privilege spoils you. and it doesn’t take much. i’l give you an example. when i first made it in america, the next time we flew, we’re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. and he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. the first time, you’re horrified. “everyone’s looking.” pretending to be late, baseball cap. oh, god. next time we flew, i went, “where’s that bloke? i’m not queueing!” it’s quick! when i fly to the states, i’ve got a place there, but i’m always working. so, someone else is paying. so, i go first class. ba. it doesn’t get any better. even if i was paying, i’d still go first class, but jane would probably be in coach… it’s ten grand a pop! that new planet of the apes movie’s on. she’ll love that. she’ll be up for that. but when someone else is paying, i say, “jane, get up here with me.” right? front two seats… they board us early. we’re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else. god. they bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. champagne. it’s great. it’s like a day off. no phone or anything. it’s like a holiday, flying to the states.\n",
            "i could do without the safety video. that’s always a bit of a downer. and totally pointless. if you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. imagine if that worked. you’re going down, the plane smashes. you go, “i’ll try it.” you do that. ball of flames, you wake up, everyone’s dead. you go, “fucking hell, that’s amazing, that is!” and they always use that voice, don’t they? that calming, hypnotic voice, like, “nothing bad will happen.” they’re saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because i’m using this voice, don’t worry. things like, “in the event of the plane landing on water–” it smashes the fuck to bits, right? they say, “in the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle.” a fucking whistle. so, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyone’s dead, except you, by a miracle. you’re bobbing around in the atlantic ocean. four degrees, that water is. you’ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in. or you’re eaten by a shark, or you drown. you’re hoping they’ve sent air-sea rescue. you’re going, “god, i’m gonna die, i don’t know what i’m doing!” hold on! i mean, air sea rescue… i don’t know if you’ve ever been in a helicopter. o course you haven’t. but… they’re fucking loud. it’s like having your head in a washing machine. you have to wear ear plugs and defenders. your teeth rattle. it’s like… like that. over the atlantic ocean at night. never gonna happen. if you crash, you die, right? but apart from that, it’s brilliant. right… i was flying heathrow to jfk just before christmas, right? boarded us early, on the plane. she comes round. “champagne in a wine glass, like you like it, mr. gervais.” she goes off. i go, “have you got any of them warm nuts?” she went, “we’re not handing out nuts on this flight. a lady’s getting on who’s so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction.” i went, “oh, my god, of course.” i was fuming. i mean… what’s that got to do with me? why can’t i eat nuts, just cause… fucking… this woman will… die, right? nuts! how has she lived this long? if walking by a nut kills you… if being… just near a nut… how has she never been near a nut… before? and how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? honestly. it’s… and if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? i mean… i never wanted nuts more. i felt she was infringing on my human right to eat nuts. and this is how spoiled i am, okay? i actually had this thought. i thought, “oh, i wish i’d brought my own nuts on.” right?. i thought for a second, but that wouldn’t work. she’d get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? like that… and… die. and someone would go, “ricky gervais brought his own nuts on.” you know, right? so i don’t take my own nuts on. now, before i fly, i have a shower, and then i rub myself all over… in nuts… just in case. then i go, “can i have any nuts?” they go, “no, sorry, this lady would die.” “yeah, not a problem.” lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog… i go, “what’s the matter?” i touch her all over. “what’s the matter?” she goes, “nuts!” right? and dies. and i go, “who’s been eating nuts?” i get off scot-free. so i got to america, i went on a chat show. tonight show with jimmy fallon. and i told that story, the whole thing. it went well, audience laughed. great. went out. next day on twitter, outrage. by “outrage”, i mean one person going, “how dare you?” this woman goes, “i saw you on jimmy fallon, making fun of nut allergies. my daughter’s nut-intolerant. how dare you?” i go, “who is this woman?” she’s tweeted 15 times. she starts @-ing nbc and jimmy fallon. i go, “what’s this? how many followers? twenty-three. ignore it.” you know when you’re being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, “so, you find so and so funny?” and cause the teacher’s really angry, yes, you do find that thing funny, whatever… she said… “would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog?” yeah. yeah, you saying that… yes. if you said that at the funeral, i would, yeah… so, someone else gets involved. ohio moms against nuts, right? and she does a blog, and they’re talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting i am. one filmed her little girl, put it on youtube, and sent me it. i opened it. sweet little girl, seven years old. and she went, “dear mr. gervais, i have a fatal nut allergy.” delete. not my problem, right? ignore. ignore. ignore. right? but then one of them said something that reeled me in. just cause i’m this self-confessed twitter police. i try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. a joke about a bad thing isn’t as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. it could be anti the bad thing. it depends on the actual joke. and this woman said… “you should never make jokes about food allergies.” i should have left it, right? i sent back, “i make jokes about aids, cancer, famine, and the holocaust. and you’re telling me i should never joke about food allergies?” she sent back, “yes, but the holocaust didn’t kill children.” well… it did, didn’t it? it was horrible, the holocaust. some would say as bad as food allergies. “didn’t kill children…” jesus. it did kill children. hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. i have to say, hitler, you couldn’t make him up. the worst human being to walk the face of the earth. he is a crazy… evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. just terrible. but… if i was throwing a dinner party, and i’d been slaving over a hot stove, and i was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and i had to… either invite hitler or that little girl with food allergies… i know who’d ruin that party more. everyone’s enjoying it. “everything okay?” “ja, ist yummy!” right? he’s loving it. i go, “cheers, you fucker! how you doing, boy?” she’s going, “i can’t eat that.” fucking hell. “who wants ferrero rocher?” “me!” “all right. here!” “i can’t eat them.” oh, fuck off home. right?\n",
            "that’s what the world’s like. people see something they don’t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. they want us to care about their thing as much as they do. it’s why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. i think i’ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity… 1965 to 2015, the peak of civilization, for everything. for tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. now it’s going the other way a bit. last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe. i’m not saying this because i’m old. old people say things like, “oh, everything was better when i was a kid.” course it was. you were a kid. everything’s better when you’re a kid. being old is the shit bit. whatever’s happening, being old is… i wake up these days, and i go, “oh fuck, i didn’t die.” gotta do it all again. i’m usually hung over, headache, liver pains. i can’t walk for the first five minutes, ’cause i’ve got no joints in my knees. i’m getting fat again now, right? i was thin till i was about 28, proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. then i got a job, right? and the next, sort of, 20 years were what i call my eating years… and i just got steadily fatter and fatter. until i reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when i was about 48 years old. there was one christmas, i was at home, lying on the floor… and… i was saying to jane, “i’m having a heart attack.” right? and, honestly, my heart rate was like 130. i felt nauseous, i had palpitations, i was sweating. because i’d eaten eleven sausages. true story, right? i was like one of them snakes. like when you see a big, like… python swallow a pig whole. and then it’s just fucked. it’s, like… it’ll sit there for a week. it’s like a duffel bag. just there, like that. that was me, right? i wasn’t having a heart attack, but it worried jane. she said, “you gotta look after yourself.” i thought, “you’re right. 48.” so i started working out, right, every day. i didn’t give anything up. i don’t eat meat anymore. but i was having 2500, 3000 calories a day, including wine every night. but i burnt it off the next day. just so i could do all that, i worked out every day, running, weight training… i had more time on my hands than the average person. i had a gym in my house, i had no excuse. i lost 20 pounds. it was great. but now, i still eat and drink too much, but i physically can’t… burn off the calories. i can’t do enough. cause i’m so old and broken and tired. so, i’m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time i am going to die. i’m losing my hair. it’s getting really thin. i know it looks great from there. cheers, but… no, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? i’ll have to buzz that off soon. i’d never wear a wig, oh, my god. if you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think you’ve got away with it… you haven’t. everyone knows. everyone knows immediately. my brain knows a wig has come into the room before i do, right? i could be at a party, it’ll go, “there’s a wig in here.” -i go. “is there?” -“yes! there is, yeah!” spidey senses for the wig. it’s obvious. the way they smile, like nothing’s wrong. hiya. it’s the telltale signs, isn’t it? i was put off wigs for life by my uncle reginald. great bloke. he’s dead now. died a few years ago. i was only little. he went bald in his twenties. tragically bald. his hair fell out. it might have been something like alopecia. but he was bald for ten years into his thirties. turns up one day at our house… “elvis! what is–” i was about eight, i said to auntie edna, “what happened?” she went, “it was a miracle.” they were lying! they were just… everyone knew he was bald! but he’d embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. they’re going, “yeah, it just grew back.” there’s so much he wouldn’t do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. we weren’t allowed balloons at parties, right? auntie edna said, “reg is allergic to balloons.” he wasn’t allergic. he was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. we’ve got photos in the family album. if he’s at a wedding or a christening, and he’s holding a baby, it’s always at arms’ length. like that. so it can’t grab his wig. it must have been on his mind all the time, right? it was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. he was in the army, hard as nails. he wasn’t scared of anyone or anything. spiders, snakes… cancer… how’s the chemo going, uncle? “not a problem.” we’ve got a photo of him, the last year, i think. he was 75. it must have been the last year he was alive. it was a hot day. he was in the garden. in his little trunks. he was a wizened little man by then. white chest hair. jet black wig still! died in it, buried in it. he’s wearing it now. a little skeleton with jet black hair. like posh spice for eternity. but i knew that was gonna happen. i knew i would get old and fat and… ill and blind and deaf and… shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. you’re ready, because you’re warned. you know about getting old. what they don’t talk about, so you’re not prepared, and it was a shock to me… i only found out recently, i’ll share it with you now. the distending testicles. see, you don’t know about it. but it happens in your fifties. i wasn’t checking them or anything… i didn’t see ’em for 20 years. as a young man, they were pert, and now they’re like two plums in a sock. i don’t know when it happened, but it was recently. they just… and this is how i found out. so, as i’ve been getting older, and they’ve been secretly stretching away… as i’ve got older, i’ve got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. last year, i moved into a new house in hampstead. big bath. big sunken bath. south-facing windows. i was in there the first night. lovely bath. sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. i looked down. and they’re floating. right? now, i’d never dreamt that testicles would float. they seem like they’d be heavy. you could tie things down with them, and they’d sink. you know? most people never see their… in the sea, you’re in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths aren’t usually that deep! that was my first thought. “oh, my god, i never thought testicles would float.” then my second thought kicked in. “hold on, this bath’s two feet deep!” right? i’m sitting on the bottom, they’re on top. what’s going on? right? and… i looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. easily, by some way, right? in fact, they’d created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? my penis was dry, just nestled, just… floating on top. like that. like that. just bouncing around. i should have given it a little whistle. i’m just thinking, “this is bizarre.” fucking hell, right? and… i thought, “maybe it’s a fluke.” so i held them under the water for a minute, i let them go and they bobbed up! they’re really… they’re really buoyant, right? try it when you get home, if you’re in your 50s. and a man, obviously. or caitlyn jenner. but… but the world is getting worse. and i blame the beginning of its demise on social media. because twitter and facebook, that’s where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. everything was “like me”, “agree with me”. it falls into two tribes. “i don’t agree with them, so i block them.” and now, in this post-truth era, people don’t care about the argument, they say, “who’s saying the argument? no, they’re not on our side.” it’s ludicrous, okay? and it also bred this ridiculous notion we’ve always had. my opinion is worth as much as yours. now, it’s my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. i get tweets from people saying, “i believe the earth is 6,000 years old.” “i believe you’re a fucking idiot.” you can’t have an opinion on the age of the earth. you can have opinions, but not your own facts. but it was all about being popular, right? and even politicians picked up those symptoms. politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. we had a brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. they didn’t want to make a mistake. and there’s a ridiculous thing of, “let’s ask the average person what they think.” let’s stop asking the average person what they… do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? we still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say “do not drink”. right? let’s take those labels off, right? for two years. and then have a referendum. but it’s not just politicians. even real news. the news on tv says things like, “tweet us your news.” don’t let them tweet you the news! -“i saw a tyrannosaurus rex.” -you liar! right? there was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. the results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. he said, “we’ve looked at everything, and we’ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so we’re going to slow them down a bit. statistically, this shouldn’t happen again.” that would have been it. but the guy went, “we asked the public what they thought.” then there was three banal vox pops. first one said, “i already pay £960 a year, so i’m not happy.” the next one said, “it takes me 45 minutes each way, it’s not good enough.” the last one said, “i say it’s better to arrive at work late than dead.” why is that on the news? and when is that applicable in any situation? all right, ted? you’re in early. ted? oh, ted! we’ve been through this. remember i said i’d rather you arrive late than dead? but… the big enemy is stupidity… right? i wanna share with you the most stupid tweet i ever got. now, admittedly, when i first got on twitter, i pushed my agenda. i was an outspoken atheist. not to change anyone’s opinions. i thought it was important to tell the other side. there are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. i just wanted to say, “it’s fine to be an atheist. it’s fine to believe in god, and it’s fine not to.” that’s all i was saying. i realized i didn’t have to tweet about religion or atheism. i could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. i’d tweet things like “happy birthday, earth. four point six billion years old today.” someone would always go, “we know what you’re fucking doing.” this is a tweet i got after one of those. and… it was all in capitals, which excited me… that’s the sign of twitter madness. mixed with anger. it’s great, right? i looked at his profile. sure enough, he’s a gentleman from texas. he’s a fundamentalist, creationist christian. which is fine! he loves god. he loves god and… fetuses, mainly. he loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then he’s… remember it’s in capitals. he’s shouting at me. best tweet ever. “your science–” my science, right? science, by the way, is spelled s-c-i-e-n-t-s. already good, isn’t it? i mean… he’s obviously heard the word, he took a guess… never seen it written down, because it’s not in the bible. so he’s… “your scients won’t help you… well, it will. it’s helping him… beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. “your scients won’t help you when satan…” of course he believes in satan. why not? he believes that god made the universe in six days. you’re not gonna say to him, “do you believe in satan?” and have him say, “bit far-fetched.” why doesn’t god kill satan? that’s… what i’d ask him. if i was wrong and i met god, i’d go, “oh, you do exist.” he’d go, “yeah.” i’d go, “i’ve got a few fucking questions, mate. the first one would be, “why did you make chocolate kill dogs?” mental, right? also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male g-spot up the arse? what… what is wrong with you? then i’d say, “why don’t you kill satan?” and he’d go, “what?” i’d go, “why don’t you kill satan? if he does all the bad stuff and you do all the good stuff, which you want… i mean, you do want–” “yes, yeah.” “you could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy.” “yeah.” “why don’t you kill him, then?” “because… shut up.” “your scients won’t help you when satan is raping your british ass.” and he’s got a point. because if i die, and i find myself in hell, being raped by satan… science has pretty much let me down. but it’s this last line that he just throws away. the line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet i’ve ever received. “your scients won’t help you when satan is raping your british ass. i’ll be laughing.” so… he’s there too! he’s… so, he’s a fundamentalist… christian, who’s lived his life by the old and new testaments. he dies, he wakes up in hell, right? which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma… “oh, my god, i’m in hell! oh, my god, why have you forsaken me? i’m gonna be tortured for eternity!” he sees me getting raped and goes, “ha, ha, ha!” he’s suddenly over it, is he? his day’s suddenly got a little bit brighter. and like he’s not next, right? so i’m getting raped, right, by the devil, right? he’s just there. “you fucking atheist scum.” and i’m like that. “yeah, whatever.” i assume it happens all eternity. “yeah, yeah, whatever.” like that. i might say, “watch your hooves on my testicles.” and he’d go, “why are they so distended?” and i go, “oh, like you’re brad pitt!” you know what i mean? sorry, are we talking or raping? can we… “you lying, fucking atheist.” he’s probably bored. “fucking atheists. every fucking day.” right? his little gargoyle comes up. “satan?” he goes, “what?” and i go, “yeah? what?” he goes, “there’s a fundamentalist christian.” “fuck this!” he’d be on him like a ton of bricks! so… i got that tweet. i loved it. all i did was re-tweet, right? and just watch the fun, people piling on, going, “ah, loser!” and he’s fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, “go fuck your sister, you english faggot!” that makes no sense at all. i forgot about it. went and did something else. few hours later, on twitter again. it’s still all going off, right? it’s really funny, i’m laughing at all the replies. people saying things to him. i’m scrolling down. there’s one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. she says, “you find rape funny?” no! no! what? no… “your mates find rape funny?” no! listen, right? “you find rape funny?” listen, everyone! listen, right? no… i said to her, “i didn’t tweet that.” -she went, “you retweeted it.” -to show he’s an idiot. “but you must find it funny or amusing. it’s not a frivolous thing.” i said, “no, well, it’s up to him, isn’t it? he can do it.” now i’m arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. but i’m fighting for his right… to fantasize about me being raped by the devil. because i’m so conscious of “freedom of speech”… what a topsy-turvy world, right? although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. because she did that thing that people do. she didn’t say, “what, you find jokes about rape funny?” she said, “what, you find rape funny?” the answer to that is, no, of course not. no one finds rape funny. not even rapists find rape funny, know what i mean? noone ever gives evidence saying, “it was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling.” that’s never… so… i sent back, “you mean jokes about rape?” she said, “yes.” -i went, “depends on the joke.” “-it fucking doesn’t!” i’m going, “no, it does! it does! it depends on the joke. it’s about context, it’s about content. what do you mean by a rape joke?” she said, “even a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it is unacceptable.” i said, “that’s ridiculous, it depends what the joke is.” i tweeted that clip of me in the office, going, “i think there’s been a rape up there!” everyone gets that because of the context. and the target is a middle-aged man, who’s so narcissistic, he’ll say anything to win a silly game. you have to understand the joke and where it comes from. i said, “some jokes don’t punch up or down. they don’t punch anywhere. they can just be a pun, a play on words, that don’t really mean anything.” a joke went round when i was a kid, even adults told it. i’ll tell you. a woman goes running into a police station. she says, “help, i’ve been graped!” the policeman says, “do you mean raped?” she says, “no, there was a bunch of them.” that is a rape joke, right? so…. and i even said to her, “no, i agree, in most cases, yeah. real rape jokes, they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. disgusting! i’d never tell those. but it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject.” i calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. she ended it by saying, “well, okay, i see your point, but… still… i will laugh at a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped.” i should have left it. i just sent back, “what a weird door policy.” you turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, “can i just ask you a question?” yeah. have you ever been raped? i have, yes. you can’t come in. what? why? a lady says she won’t laugh if you’re in. off you go. that’s what the world is like. people take everything personally. they think the world revolves around them, particularly on twitter. i’m not tweeting anyone, i’m just tweeting. i don’t know who’s following me. i’ve got 12 million followers. they can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. that’s like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying “guitar lessons”, and you go, “but i don’t fucking want guitar lessons!” what’s this? there’s a number here. right, call that. are you giving guitar lessons? i don’t fucking want any! fine! it’s not for you, then. just walk away. don’t worry about it.\n",
            "i should say one thing in twitter’s defense. i use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. but one great thing about twitter, for me, personally, i’m very into anti animal cruelty. years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. standing outside tesco’s or something. that’s the magic number, because then it gets heard in parliament. i’ve been part of many campaigns through twitter when we’ve got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. thank you to those who’ve retweeted about animal cruelty. it makes a difference. thank you. but even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, you think no one’s gonna argue with that. yes, they will. they just wanna be heard. i’ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. i say, “ban bullfighting.” someone always says, “what about the kids in syria?” what? well, i’m not giving you a choice. you can do both. i’m not saying, “throw that kid back in the hole, there’s a bull here!” and there’s one thing that i didn’t want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that i found out, through twitter. there’s a thing called the yulin dog meat festival, in china, every year. and it’s horrendous. and we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. it’s a drop in the ocean. they eat thousands over this weekend. i tweet the details, the petition, people don’t really read it. it’s a knee-jerk. people say, “racist!” i go, “what?” they go, “we eat pigs and cows in the west.” yep, we do. i don’t but, yeah, i used to. you’re right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. it’s not about the species. it’s what they do to these poor dogs. what they do is torture the dogs first. ‘cause they think it makes the meat taste better. they beat them, they blowtorch them. they even skin them alive. and i saw this picture… on twitter of the opening of this ceremony. these two guys, in this chinese square, and they’re skinning this dog alive. it’s screaming, they’re laughing. it’s the worst thing i’ve ever seen. i thought, “i’ve got to tweet that.” i tweeted the picture, with a petition, and i just said, “one beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive.” right? and it took off. loads of retweets, it made the press. i got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, “is that language necessary?” i should have left it, right? but i was… i was incensed! i said, “you’re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death?” she said, “i just hate the c-word.” i definitely should have left it. i sent back, “people who hate the c-word would hear it a lot less, if they didn’t go round acting like such cunts.” thank you! you’ve been fantastic! good night! cheers! thank you so much! thank you so much. i hope you enjoyed the show. i hope no-one was offended. no, i really do! that’s not the point. i’ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad people. i think it’s my upbringing. i grew up… in poverty, with nothing. but the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. that was the men. the women carried on working. it was my older brother, bob, it was him who i first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. people were laughing. i realized, “he’s healing them.” that’s what comedy’s for, what humor’s for. it gets us over bad stuff. right? typical bob story. he once spent an hour in the pound shop in hayling island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. just to see if he could break this poor man’s will. bob was the first person i saw answer back to authority. the first authority you come across are your parents. and he’d get in trouble. he got sent to bed. but i thought he’d won the argument. and he’d tease my mum. my mum was a typical working-class woman. as i say, we lived in a shitty area, right? and most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. she mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. she thought, “if it looked respectable, we’d be respectable.” it was about reputation, i guess. bob would send her postcards that just read, “is that pedophile postman still reading your mail?” and she’d take it, she’d go in, and she’d be horrified. she’d call bob. “he saw it this time, you must stop doing that!” even at her funeral… my mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. at mum’s funeral, we had different duties. i did catering and flowers. bob went to see the local vicar. that was a mistake, right? we’d never been to church, he didn’t know us, we didn’t know him. so, he said to bob, “tell me about your mum, so i can say a few words.” bob saw that as an opportunity, right? so, bob, with a straight face, said, “well, she was a keen racist.” the vicar went, “i can’t say that.” bob said, “okay, put she liked gardening.” he was trying to get the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. he didn’t warn us. and he did get something by the vicar. so we’re called ricky, robert– bob– ricky, robert, marsha and larry. now, larry is the oldest, in his seventies. born in the war. i always thought he was the sensible one. first born, weight of the world on his shoulders. my mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. he’s a stand-up guy, larry. so, bob… gives the vicar the wrong name. didn’t warn us. we’re all in church. start of the funeral, we’re all there. packed out. the coffin comes down. guided by the vicar. the vicar goes to his pulpit. all confident, with his little notes, right? and he goes… eva leaves behind four loving children. ricky. robert. marsha. and barry. and… we snort like that, right? bob’s going… everyone realizes. we’re all laughing. we see larry go… all right. and the church is like… every time we thought of it, we’d see larry go… like that, right? then we’d just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? larry eventually started doing this. and the vicar’s thinking, “what have i said?” right? he’d put in a few things the vicar didn’t know that set us off again. things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. my nieces and nephews started crying. i’d come prepared with a pack of tissues. they’d take one and hand it on. before the funeral, i’d taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. and each tissue said, “snivelling fucking bitch.” and they’re sort of laughing. so it was like a madhouse, right? everything the vicar said or did, we all started fucking laughing! right? and you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. he ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and bob. he said, “sorry, was that okay?” me and bob went, “fucking brilliant, mate. it was fucking brilliant.” that’s what i mean. we’re all gonna die, so we should have a laugh. if you can laugh in the face of adversity, you’re bullet-proof. me and my brother, bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, you’ve got to say it. win, lose or draw. it might go well… it might go badly. but you’ve gotta say it. and bear that in mind, as i leave you with this. right… so… we’re all in the car one day. bob’s driving. packed in this car. a little day trip to the beach. we get stopped for a security check. and there’s a british bobby there. and he stops the car. bob’s at the window. he said, “where are we off to?” bob went, “bognor.” he went, “can you just pop the boot, please?” so he looks at that. looks in the boot, like that. back to bob’s window. gets that mirror on a stick thing. and he starts just looking under the car. and as he does that, his helmet falls off, right? and out of the helmet falls a packet of 20 cigarettes. and the copper went, “bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets.” and bob went, “i knew it wasn’t fucking brains.” you’ve been amazing. good night! prolefeed. your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * \n",

poodles” “yeah” “do you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals” “yeah” “that’s your job” that’s your job “ridgebacks” “yo” “you’re hunting lions” “what” “you’re hunting lions” “fuck off” “yeah you are” “no we’re not look lions we’ll get fucking mashed why can’t the rottweilers hunt lions” “they’re shaking babies” good boy good boy you shake that baby if you want good boy cheers this is my first new standup for seven years if you don’t count the golden globes which you shouldn’t the golden globes very different god a different vibe two hundred million people watching and it’s live big thrill but with that many people watching there’s a bit of stick everyone’s different everyone’s a blogger everyone goes “i was offended” “why” “he said an horrible thing” “he said loads of horrible things” “yeah but that was a thing that i care about” that’s the thing about offense it’s about personal feelings i don’t care about the backlash “comedian in hot water” you know my girlfriend jane she worries and she reads things “what have you said” “don’t worry they won’t come to the house fuck ’em” so i wind her up i pretend i’m gonna say much worse things than i ever would i have to make up worse jokes than i actually… just to scare my girlfriend when i do the golden globes we go out about a week before it’s in la we fly out i’m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches they release more presenters i take my pick “i got a good intro for them yeah mel gibson i’ll introduce him yes” about three days before this last one just to wind jane up i said “i got a good intro” she went “what” i said “bill cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch please welcome helen mirren” i didn’t do it she said “you won’t do that” i said “no” next day i got her again i said “is this too much” i said “not even bill cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast please welcome melissa mccarthy” i didn’t do it i would never… i’d never… tell a joke like that it’s horrible i was just doing it to annoy jane i’d never even… think… of that so don’t… even on the day on the way to the red carpet in the limo i said “i’ll start with a funny oneliner an oldfashioned joke” she went “what” i said “what did the deaf dumb and blind orphan get for christmas” jane went “i don’t know” i said “cancer” i didn’t do it so… you’re getting offended at a joke that doesn’t exist so… i’d never say that in public so… to anyone who mattered anyway so don’t… i didn’t have to worry about offending anyone it just happens the big controversy last time i did it was a caitlyn jenner joke outrage on twitter the next day i mean a couple of people going “it was transphobic” it wasn’t transphobic in the slightest it was a joke about a trans person but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence and that’s the other thing about offense people mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target they’re not necessarily the same i’ll tell you the joke you make your minds up it’s live so they go “your host for the 68th annual golden globes awards please welcome ricky gervais” they’re all clapping the actors are smiling at me nervously it’s brilliant right so i just go “relax i’m gonna be nice tonight i’ve changed not as much as bruce jenner obviously” and i go “now caitlyn jenner of course” and what a year she’s had became a role model for trans people everywhere bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes she didn’t do a lot for women drivers…” that’s a clever joke i’ll tell you why right it’s layered no listen right the subject of that joke is stereotypes i’m playing with the notion of stereotypes i start by saying she’s a real woman a liberal progressive attitude then if she’s a real woman i hit them with the oldfashioned stereotype she must be a bad driver then right the target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car let’s not forget that shall we a celebrity killing someone in their car running home and popping on a dress that’s… the target of the joke just so we’re clear okay she was interviewed a week later at a press conference for a show of hers now cancelled and… one of the press said “what do you think of the ricky gervais joke” she went “maybe i should host the golden globes” and they tweeted that and ed me in because they want a celebrity feud it was clickbait i rose to the bait obviously… i just sent back “let her host just don’t let her drive” another website that was in the room entertainment weekly they tweeted a different headline and they ed me in their headline was “caitlyn finally breaks silence over ricky gervais” i just sent back “at last she always brakes too late” bring it on bring it on but i’m a considered comedian i like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair so i was engaging these people saying “why is it transphobic” they said “it’s about a trans person” that’s ridiculous that’s like saying a joke about bill cosby is automatically racist it depends on the joke but i’m willing to learn i found out my crime was that i deadnamed her i’d never heard that term before a day after the golden globes and that was saying her old name and even acknowledging she used to be a man but she did i saw him on the olympic games he was a decathlete he was in everything all over the place shot put and pole vault he won a medal he was famous he was on telly all the time you know a big… famous… man with a huge… i don’t know i’m guessing probably he was big but i’ve learnt my lesson now i know it’s wrong i’d never deadname her now but years ago when she was a… man… years ago i’m saying and she went to the… doctor… and… knocked on the door the doctor went “come in” this is years ago i’d never deadname her now but this is like… a flashback before anyone… you know what… so… so like “come in” and he went “hello bruce jenner” because that… that was his name… then the doctor– this was years ago… the doctor went “all right bruce jenner how you doing you fucker you big old lunk how you doing come here you you fucker how you doing brucie boy” and bruce jenner– that was his name this is years ago right so… bruce jenner went “yeah yeah not too bad doctor yeah” “what can i do for you bruce you fucker how you doing boy” and bruce jenner went– that was his name bruce jenner went… “look at that” the doctor went “come on bruce jenner you know the rules” he uses his whole name every time for some reason… “come on bruce jenner you fucker you know the rules you can’t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here mate” bruce jenner went “no that’s not my pole that’s my enormous penis” “well seeing as it’s your penis you can bring it in here but you should have left your shot puts outside” and bruce jenner went… that was his name for… fiftyeight years i think he went “no they’re not my shot puts doctor they’re my enormous testicles” that’s where i keep my testosterone and my spunk and shit right and the doctor went “oh yeah that makes perfect– i’m a medical man you’re a big bloke you fucker how you doing boy you’re a big… you’re big and you would have a big old… cock and… balls they’re beautiful” bit familiar innit “no you must be very proud of them bruce” bruce went “this is going to surprise you doctor i wanna get rid of them” and the doctor went “what why” “oh they get in the way” “in the way of what” “fucking driving for one thing” so i’m engaging these people and i’m saying “but i had to say her old name that’s the joke i say “i’ve changed not as much as bruce jenner” then i do the joke” but no this is my second crime i say she hasn’t changed she’s always identified as a woman that means she’s a woman fine if that’s the rules if you feel you’re a woman you are i’m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far in fact i don’t think it’s going far enough cause i’ve always identified as a chimp right well i am a chimp if i say i’m a chimp i am a chimp preop but… don’t ever deadname me don’t call me ricky gervais again from now on you call me bobo i’m gonna have species realignment i’m halfway there i’m short with short legs and long arms i stoop my back’s getting hairier by the day i’ve got fangs like that i love nuts i love nuts once i was at the zoo and people were looking at me so i just started masturbating like… so… i am a chimp right i am a chimp if i say i’m a chimp i’ve got to live as a chimp for a year then have hormones get me all nice and hairy that’d be lovely i’m gonna stay a male chimp… so i can keep all that right male heterosexual chimp keep the same girlfriend jane would be happy she loves me she loves chimps so… you know i reckon that’s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp we’re so close than for a man to turn into a woman in many ways a bit of hair and a top lip like that as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off… and a hole gouged out into– i’m not a doctor but that is… the gist of it i know which one i’d rather have done i’m not saying chimps are better than women no way right any ladies here i can’t see you but to me every single one of you is equal… to a chimp so… so i’d have all that done hair and that i’d do all that all the… i’ll retain the ability to speak english like in emergencies i’m talking to jane she’s going “what is it” “what is it bobo” “you left the fucking oven on there’s a fire” are you saying that if caitlyn jenner was being chased by a wolf and there was a big fence but she had a long pole she’d… revert she’d be over that fucking… easy so i’d have all that done top lip doing all that right i’ll be legally a chimp i’ll be well… properly chimpedup i’ll be able to use chimp toilets i’ll be walking along holding jane’s hand “come on bobo” right we don’t hold hands now i don’t know why she’s all over me now i’m a chimp but we’ll be all in love maybe matching jumpers “come on bobo” in love just two… like that then if a bigot in a van slows down and goes “that’s fucking disgusting” i’ll fling shit at him and run up a tree and that’s why that joke isn’t transphobic so… cheers so humanity what is humanity what are we well we’ve touched upon it there we’re great apes not metaphorically we’re literally great apes we are 986 genetically identical to a chimpanzee we’re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas we left our common ancestor about six million years ago we have the same life cycle same as any other animal which is… our parents mate… we’re born… we grow… we mate… our parents die… our friends die… and then we die now… my sevenyearold niece didn’t like hearing that but i said “you’ve gotta learn stop crying” i said “you’re seven you know… today so… any more grizzling and this party’s cancelled so…” let’s take the first of those birth it’s odd because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period i mean because of our evolution our brain is so big we have to get that huge head out early that’s why the skull is in parts and supple then we go on gestating outside the womb that’s why we’re so useless look at other mammals a giraffe is walking along it goes “i’m proper pregnant” right i’m gonna have a baby giraffe right here yeah there it is see you later and the baby goes “mum” it’s got to be fucking ready we’re… we’re helpless right just think nine months we’re growing in this perfect environment everything’s… it’s like being in a little kate bush video right then suddenly you’re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass you’re covered in shit there’s screaming you go “i can’t breathe” someone goes “yes you fucking can” the first one second of life on earth you don’t know where you are you can’t choose where you’re born i was born in whitley estate in reading right i wouldn’t have chosen that i’d have chosen hampstead i did choose hampstead it just took 45 years to be able to afford it very different very different my upbringing to how i live now now i live a privileged life hampstead is ridiculous it’s a rarefied place it’s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me new money right but growing up it was tough i don’t know about now but in my day my estate was rough and scary it felt like wildlife i was weak and vulnerable there was danger round every corner my school was on my street and i ran there every day so i didn’t get mugged or molested there weren’t many pedophiles in reading the murderers had killed a lot but there was still a couple i moved to hampstead oh my god there’s no crime i saw a knife once in hampstead it was a palette knife just a bloke oil painting in the middle of the street broad daylight noone gobbing on it or calling him “bender” it was weird i know my life has changed drastically it wasn’t always like that as a famous person you read about yourself gossip and twitter and everything one thing kept cropping up even as i prepared for this tour people kept saying “he’s out of touch he’s so famous he’s rich he’s megarich” i am right i could have this place burnt down for a laugh no but they say things like “he’s an observational comedian how can he say things that relate to ordinary… scum” and i say i say “don’t call them scum right” but even the papers they try and… get around to it i do interviews and they’ll always say “do you always fly first class” i go “no often private” right the number of times i’ve answered this question they say “do you know how much a pint of milk is” to make you look out of touch i don’t know but that’s irrelevant next time a journalist asks me i’ll say “i don’t know but here’s a grand run and get me one” is that enough that enough yeah another question i always get particularly with the posh sundays doing a profile piece they’re still trying to alienate you make you look different they say things like “you don’t have children” i say “no” “why don’t you have children” which is an odd question why don’t you have children as opposed to asking people “why do you have children” let’s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she’s had eight shall we nine that one just fell out that one didn’t even touch the sides or… disturb her cigarette that one just… go and claim for that people say it’s selfish to not have children how is it selfish to not bring a life into the world that doesn’t exist on any level there’s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going “we want to be born” right but i’ve thought about it and there’s three reasons i don’t have children three main reasons and i’ll share them with you three reasons one there’s millions the world’s overpopulated noone’s going “rick’s not having kids we’re gonna run out fuck” two kids are scroungers aren’t they i mean from day one it’s all “me me me” isn’t it “feed me” “clothe me” “pay for my chemotherapy” no… no not my problem son not mine luck of the draw boy luck of the draw it costs the average household in the west 200000 to bring up a child and they don’t want to pay you back they’re not grateful they don’t go “thanks for having me” it’s “i didn’t wanna be born” even if they get a top job which they won’t you’ll never see that money back they’ll just put you in a home okay and my kid he’d be born into ridiculous wealth wouldn’t he so… he’d be a little cunt a little hampstead cunt… running around with all the other fucking little hampstead cunts being all hampstead and cunty “i’m a little hampstead cunt” yes i know “these are my cunty friends” i know it’s obvious i can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you’re little hampstead cunts you little posh hampstead… first he’d know he was a little hampstead cunt “i’m a little…” yes we know everyone knows right he’d know that right on the other hand he’d know he’d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad i’d say “i worked my way up from nothing and you’re just a useless hampstead cunt” he’d go “yeah” and that would probably prey on his little mind a bit eleven twelve he’d be naughty run with the wrong crowd try and get out from under my shadow then he’d turn to drugs about 30 he’d come home and overdose on my afghan rug twenty grand that was right and as he was there convulsing and throwing up his fucking lungs right and with his little posh highpitched fucking death rattle… his little fucking dying words he’d go “do you love me now daddy” no no no i never did that’s why you’ll never be born you useless fucking junkie hampstead cunt and three… i’d worry sick about him you know no i would i’ve only got a cat now and i worry sick about her i check the door three times when i go out so she doesn’t escape i put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she’s peckish a human baby oh my god the responsibility of a human life i’d watch it sleep you know we said how weak and vulnerable they are oh my god you perfect little thing oh you flesh of my flesh now go to sleep in your expensive cot like that night night sleep tight don’t let the bedbugs… dead yeah just… why why is it dead it’s just fucking dead look fuck’s sake fucking hell what the… what a fucking waste of time that was fuck’s sake embarrassing “jane” “what” “come here” “i’m in the shower” “come here” “what” “fucking dead already i didn’t… just fucking… fucking hell jane you call that a baby that is…” if jane was out i’d have to text her wouldn’t i what could you… “baby’s dead” she’d come back “what the fuck” i’d go “yep… forget the pampers lol” but even if it made it through the terrifying cot years and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables with their sharp edges i’d have to pad them so it didn’t run into it cave its head in and die then social services come round and say “is this your child mr gervais” “yeah” “what happened here then” i go “it’s a fucking idiot” i did think of adopting for a while a little third world child because that would tick all three boxes one i wouldn’t be adding to the population problem i’d be alleviating an existing problem a young kid born through no fault of his own into abject poverty he would have died i can literally save his life and give him a great upbringing right two he would be grateful wouldn’t he he’d wanna pay me back woudn’t he particularly if i let him know the other kids in the village weren’t so lucky they didn’t… they didn’t make it out right i’d tell him that early on so he really bucked his ideas up i’d go “tunde come here come here yeah yeah go and pop a shirt on you’re not in africa now that’s better yeah tunde look– yeah water straight out of a tap innit yes yeah yeah no it’s not free it’s hampstead you know but… yeah course it’s safe safe fresh drinking water have as much as you want have a bucket full fresh drinking water there you go go and clean the car go on” no i’d go “look remember all your friends in the village back in africa they’re all dead a rich man didn’t save them and bring them to hampstead do you wanna pay me back” “yeah” “yeah i bet you do” the good thing about them is they can start work when they’re about… six i just call up nike and i go… “do you still make your stuff in sweatshops got a great little worker here yeah pound a day’s fine he’s gotta start somewhere and three… if he ran round and caved his head in… and died and social services came round and said “is this your child mr gervais” i’d go “does it look like mine” i’d go… “this is hampstead it’s obviously broken in” that’s why i don’t have kids even though i don’t have children of my own people still show me photos of theirs like i give a shit i don’t mean my own family they’ve given up i’ve got older brothers and sisters they’ve had loads of kids and their kids have kids and then their kids there’s about 50 i don’t know all their names i see them at christmas it’s all “uncle ricky” they know i’ve got a bit of cash they go through my pockets and then fuck off it’s like being mugged by mice right i don’t mean them i mean strangers i could be busy i could be working like on the set of a tv or film or something stressed producing or directing it you get someone who’s in for one day with one line or a stuntman they introduce themselves “good be with you in a minute” then they hover “busy” i go “yeah yes yeah” they go “working the weekend” i go “not filming but i’ll be in the edit” “i’m taking my youngest to ballet lessons” “ah great great” “yeah she’s eight” “i’ve got a photograph” i go “you know what show me it if she goes missing i’ll keep an eye open in the woods” you’ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole and go “she’s beautiful” it’s gotta be long too short it’s awkward they know you go “yeah right” too long and it’s like “she’s… she’s fucking beautiful” it’s a minefield innit so… i’m not out of touch but i am spoiled there’s a difference i didn’t have any money until i was 40 i’ve got the same family friends and values but i am spoiled because opportunity and privilege spoils you and it doesn’t take much i’l give you an example when i first made it in america the next time we flew we’re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing and he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side the first time you’re horrified “everyone’s looking” pretending to be late baseball cap oh god next time we flew i went “where’s that bloke i’m not queueing” it’s quick when i fly to the states i’ve got a place there but i’m always working so someone else is paying so i go first class ba it doesn’t get any better even if i was paying i’d still go first class but jane would probably be in coach… it’s ten grand a pop that new planet of the apes movie’s on she’ll love that she’ll be up for that but when someone else is paying i say “jane get up here with me” right front two seats… they board us early we’re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else god they bring round these snacks these warmed caramelized nuts in a bowl champagne it’s great it’s like a day off no phone or anything it’s like a holiday flying to the states\n",
            "i could do without the safety video that’s always a bit of a downer and totally pointless if you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour the brace position does fuck all imagine if that worked you’re going down the plane smashes you go “i’ll try it” you do that ball of flames you wake up everyone’s dead you go “fucking hell that’s amazing that is” and they always use that voice don’t they that calming hypnotic voice like “nothing bad will happen” they’re saying horrendous things but nothing bad will happen because i’m using this voice don’t worry things like “in the event of the plane landing on water–” it smashes the fuck to bits right they say “in the event of the plane landing on water your life jacket is equipped with a whistle” a fucking whistle so the plane hits the water smashes to bits everyone’s dead except you by a miracle you’re bobbing around in the atlantic ocean four degrees that water is you’ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in or you’re eaten by a shark or you drown you’re hoping they’ve sent airsea rescue you’re going “god i’m gonna die i don’t know what i’m doing” hold on i mean air sea rescue… i don’t know if you’ve ever been in a helicopter o course you haven’t but… they’re fucking loud it’s like having your head in a washing machine you have to wear ear plugs and defenders your teeth rattle it’s like… like that over the atlantic ocean at night never gonna happen if you crash you die right but apart from that it’s brilliant right… i was flying heathrow to jfk just before christmas right boarded us early on the plane she comes round “champagne in a wine glass like you like it mr gervais” she goes off i go “have you got any of them warm nuts” she went “we’re not handing out nuts on this flight a lady’s getting on who’s so allergic even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction” i went “oh my god of course” i was fuming i mean… what’s that got to do with me why can’t i eat nuts just cause… fucking… this woman will… die right nuts how has she lived this long if walking by a nut kills you… if being… just near a nut… how has she never been near a nut… before and how has she lived long enough having never been near a nut how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane right honestly it’s… and if being near a nut kills you do we really want that in the gene pool i mean… i never wanted nuts more i felt she was infringing on my human right to eat nuts and this is how spoiled i am okay i actually had this thought i thought “oh i wish i’d brought my own nuts on” right i thought for a second but that wouldn’t work she’d get on and start blowing up like a frog right like that… and… die and someone would go “ricky gervais brought his own nuts on” you know right so i don’t take my own nuts on now before i fly i have a shower and then i rub myself all over… in nuts… just in case then i go “can i have any nuts” they go “no sorry this lady would die” “yeah not a problem” lady gets on sits down starts blowing up like a frog… i go “what’s the matter” i touch her all over “what’s the matter” she goes “nuts” right and dies and i go “who’s been eating nuts” i get off scotfree so i got to america i went on a chat show tonight show with jimmy fallon and i told that story the whole thing it went well audience laughed great went out next day on twitter outrage by “outrage” i mean one person going “how dare you” this woman goes “i saw you on jimmy fallon making fun of nut allergies my daughter’s nutintolerant how dare you” i go “who is this woman” she’s tweeted 15 times she starts ing nbc and jimmy fallon i go “what’s this how many followers twentythree ignore it” you know when you’re being told off and they use your own words against you like a teacher going “so you find so and so funny” and cause the teacher’s really angry yes you do find that thing funny whatever… she said… “would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog” yeah yeah you saying that… yes if you said that at the funeral i would yeah… so someone else gets involved ohio moms against nuts right and she does a blog and they’re talking to each other and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting i am one filmed her little girl put it on youtube and sent me it i opened it sweet little girl seven years old and she went “dear mr gervais i have a fatal nut allergy” delete not my problem right ignore ignore ignore right but then one of them said something that reeled me in just cause i’m this selfconfessed twitter police i try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means particularly in the context of comedy and in the context of a joke a joke about a bad thing isn’t as bad as the bad thing or necessarily condoning the bad thing it could be anti the bad thing it depends on the actual joke and this woman said… “you should never make jokes about food allergies” i should have left it right i sent back “i make jokes about aids cancer famine and the holocaust and you’re telling me i should never joke about food allergies” she sent back “yes but the holocaust didn’t kill children” well… it did didn’t it it was horrible the holocaust some would say as bad as food allergies “didn’t kill children…” jesus it did kill children hitler killed 12 million people many of them children i have to say hitler you couldn’t make him up the worst human being to walk the face of the earth he is a crazy… evil racist narcissistic serial killer just terrible but… if i was throwing a dinner party and i’d been slaving over a hot stove and i was getting everything ready and there was one place left and i had to… either invite hitler or that little girl with food allergies… i know who’d ruin that party more everyone’s enjoying it “everything okay” “ja ist yummy” right he’s loving it i go “cheers you fucker how you doing boy” she’s going “i can’t eat that” fucking hell “who wants ferrero rocher” “me” “all right here” “i can’t eat them” oh fuck off home right\n",
            "that’s what the world’s like people see something they don’t like they expect it to stop as opposed to deal with their emotions they want us to care about their thing as much as they do it’s why the world is getting worse and the world is getting worse i think i’ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity… 1965 to 2015 the peak of civilization for everything for tolerances for freedoms for communication for medicine now it’s going the other way a bit last couple of years just a little blip maybe i’m not saying this because i’m old old people say things like “oh everything was better when i was a kid” course it was you were a kid everything’s better when you’re a kid being old is the shit bit whatever’s happening being old is… i wake up these days and i go “oh fuck i didn’t die” gotta do it all again i’m usually hung over headache liver pains i can’t walk for the first five minutes ’cause i’ve got no joints in my knees i’m getting fat again now right i was thin till i was about 28 proper skinny like nine and a half stone then i got a job right and the next sort of 20 years were what i call my eating years… and i just got steadily fatter and fatter until i reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness when i was about 48 years old there was one christmas i was at home lying on the floor… and… i was saying to jane “i’m having a heart attack” right and honestly my heart rate was like 130 i felt nauseous i had palpitations i was sweating because i’d eaten eleven sausages true story right i was like one of them snakes like when you see a big like… python swallow a pig whole and then it’s just fucked it’s like… it’ll sit there for a week it’s like a duffel bag just there like that that was me right i wasn’t having a heart attack but it worried jane she said “you gotta look after yourself” i thought “you’re right 48” so i started working out right every day i didn’t give anything up i don’t eat meat anymore but i was having 2500 3000 calories a day including wine every night but i burnt it off the next day just so i could do all that i worked out every day running weight training… i had more time on my hands than the average person i had a gym in my house i had no excuse i lost 20 pounds it was great but now i still eat and drink too much but i physically can’t… burn off the calories i can’t do enough cause i’m so old and broken and tired so i’m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again and this time i am going to die i’m losing my hair it’s getting really thin i know it looks great from there cheers but… no honestly in a lift with that light directly overhead and the mirror it looks like an xray right i’ll have to buzz that off soon i’d never wear a wig oh my god if you wear a wig or a toupee and you think you’ve got away with it… you haven’t everyone knows everyone knows immediately my brain knows a wig has come into the room before i do right i could be at a party it’ll go “there’s a wig in here” i go “is there” “yes there is yeah” spidey senses for the wig it’s obvious the way they smile like nothing’s wrong hiya it’s the telltale signs isn’t it i was put off wigs for life by my uncle reginald great bloke he’s dead now died a few years ago i was only little he went bald in his twenties tragically bald his hair fell out it might have been something like alopecia but he was bald for ten years into his thirties turns up one day at our house… “elvis what is–” i was about eight i said to auntie edna “what happened” she went “it was a miracle” they were lying they were just… everyone knew he was bald but he’d embroiled his family in the lie so they had to lie as well they’re going “yeah it just grew back” there’s so much he wouldn’t do cause he was terrified of the wig coming off we weren’t allowed balloons at parties right auntie edna said “reg is allergic to balloons” he wasn’t allergic he was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater and his wig would fly across the room we’ve got photos in the family album if he’s at a wedding or a christening and he’s holding a baby it’s always at arms’ length like that so it can’t grab his wig it must have been on his mind all the time right it was the only thing he feared the wig coming off in public and this ridiculous lie being exposed he was in the army hard as nails he wasn’t scared of anyone or anything spiders snakes… cancer… how’s the chemo going uncle “not a problem” we’ve got a photo of him the last year i think he was 75 it must have been the last year he was alive it was a hot day he was in the garden in his little trunks he was a wizened little man by then white chest hair jet black wig still died in it buried in it he’s wearing it now a little skeleton with jet black hair like posh spice for eternity but i knew that was gonna happen i knew i would get old and fat and… ill and blind and deaf and… shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket you’re ready because you’re warned you know about getting old what they don’t talk about so you’re not prepared and it was a shock to me… i only found out recently i’ll share it with you now the distending testicles see you don’t know about it but it happens in your fifties i wasn’t checking them or anything… i didn’t see ’em for 20 years as a young man they were pert and now they’re like two plums in a sock i don’t know when it happened but it was recently they just… and this is how i found out so as i’ve been getting older and they’ve been secretly stretching away… as i’ve got older i’ve got richer so my baths have been getting more luxurious last year i moved into a new house in hampstead big bath big sunken bath southfacing windows i was in there the first night lovely bath sun streaming in classical music this is the life i looked down and they’re floating right now i’d never dreamt that testicles would float they seem like they’d be heavy you could tie things down with them and they’d sink you know most people never see their… in the sea you’re in trunks in the shower they dangle and baths aren’t usually that deep that was my first thought “oh my god i never thought testicles would float” then my second thought kicked in “hold on this bath’s two feet deep” right i’m sitting on the bottom they’re on top what’s going on right and… i looked and my testicles are now longer than my penis easily by some way right in fact they’d created a little fleshy sort of life raft right my penis was dry just nestled just… floating on top like that like that just bouncing around i should have given it a little whistle i’m just thinking “this is bizarre” fucking hell right and… i thought “maybe it’s a fluke” so i held them under the water for a minute i let them go and they bobbed up they’re really… they’re really buoyant right try it when you get home if you’re in your 50s and a man obviously or caitlyn jenner but… but the world is getting worse and i blame the beginning of its demise on social media because twitter and facebook that’s where this ridiculous notion bred and became stable that it was more important to be popular than right everything was “like me” “agree with me” it falls into two tribes “i don’t agree with them so i block them” and now in this posttruth era people don’t care about the argument they say “who’s saying the argument no they’re not on our side” it’s ludicrous okay and it also bred this ridiculous notion we’ve always had my opinion is worth as much as yours now it’s my opinion is worth as much as your fact which is nonsense i get tweets from people saying “i believe the earth is 6000 years old” “i believe you’re a fucking idiot” you can’t have an opinion on the age of the earth you can have opinions but not your own facts but it was all about being popular right and even politicians picked up those symptoms politicians tweet now they want to be popular we had a brexit referendum cause they passed the buck they didn’t want to make a mistake and there’s a ridiculous thing of “let’s ask the average person what they think” let’s stop asking the average person what they… do you know how fucking stupid the average person is we still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say “do not drink” right let’s take those labels off right for two years and then have a referendum but it’s not just politicians even real news the news on tv says things like “tweet us your news” don’t let them tweet you the news “i saw a tyrannosaurus rex” you liar right there was a big news story last year about a train crash that happened a year before and there was an inquiry the results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news he said “we’ve looked at everything and we’ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor so we’re going to slow them down a bit statistically this shouldn’t happen again” that would have been it but the guy went “we asked the public what they thought” then there was three banal vox pops first one said “i already pay £960 a year so i’m not happy” the next one said “it takes me 45 minutes each way it’s not good enough” the last one said “i say it’s better to arrive at work late than dead” why is that on the news and when is that applicable in any situation all right ted you’re in early ted oh ted we’ve been through this remember i said i’d rather you arrive late than dead but… the big enemy is stupidity… right i wanna share with you the most stupid tweet i ever got now admittedly when i first got on twitter i pushed my agenda i was an outspoken atheist not to change anyone’s opinions i thought it was important to tell the other side there are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist i just wanted to say “it’s fine to be an atheist it’s fine to believe in god and it’s fine not to” that’s all i was saying i realized i didn’t have to tweet about religion or atheism i could tweet a fact and that annoyed just the right people i’d tweet things like “happy birthday earth four point six billion years old today” someone would always go “we know what you’re fucking doing” this is a tweet i got after one of those and… it was all in capitals which excited me… that’s the sign of twitter madness mixed with anger it’s great right i looked at his profile sure enough he’s a gentleman from texas he’s a fundamentalist creationist christian which is fine he loves god he loves god and… fetuses mainly he loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay and then he’s… remember it’s in capitals he’s shouting at me best tweet ever “your science–” my science right science by the way is spelled scients already good isn’t it i mean… he’s obviously heard the word he took a guess… never seen it written down because it’s not in the bible so he’s… “your scients won’t help you… well it will it’s helping him… beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me “your scients won’t help you when satan…” of course he believes in satan why not he believes that god made the universe in six days you’re not gonna say to him “do you believe in satan” and have him say “bit farfetched” why doesn’t god kill satan that’s… what i’d ask him if i was wrong and i met god i’d go “oh you do exist” he’d go “yeah” i’d go “i’ve got a few fucking questions mate the first one would be “why did you make chocolate kill dogs” mental right also if you hate homosexuality so much why did you put the male gspot up the arse what… what is wrong with you then i’d say “why don’t you kill satan” and he’d go “what” i’d go “why don’t you kill satan if he does all the bad stuff and you do all the good stuff which you want… i mean you do want–” “yes yeah” “you could kill him if you wanted you can do anything easy” “yeah” “why don’t you kill him then” “because… shut up” “your scients won’t help you when satan is raping your british ass” and he’s got a point because if i die and i find myself in hell being raped by satan… science has pretty much let me down but it’s this last line that he just throws away the line he signs off with makes this the best tweet i’ve ever received “your scients won’t help you when satan is raping your british ass i’ll be laughing” so… he’s there too he’s… so he’s a fundamentalist… christian who’s lived his life by the old and new testaments he dies he wakes up in hell right which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma… “oh my god i’m in hell oh my god why have you forsaken me i’m gonna be tortured for eternity” he sees me getting raped and goes “ha ha ha” he’s suddenly over it is he his day’s suddenly got a little bit brighter and like he’s not next right so i’m getting raped right by the devil right he’s just there “you fucking atheist scum” and i’m like that “yeah whatever” i assume it happens all eternity “yeah yeah whatever” like that i might say “watch your hooves on my testicles” and he’d go “why are they so distended” and i go “oh like you’re brad pitt” you know what i mean sorry are we talking or raping can we… “you lying fucking atheist” he’s probably bored “fucking atheists every fucking day” right his little gargoyle comes up “satan” he goes “what” and i go “yeah what” he goes “there’s a fundamentalist christian” “fuck this” he’d be on him like a ton of bricks so… i got that tweet i loved it all i did was retweet right and just watch the fun people piling on going “ah loser” and he’s fighting back really witlessly saying things like “go fuck your sister you english faggot” that makes no sense at all i forgot about it went and did something else few hours later on twitter again it’s still all going off right it’s really funny i’m laughing at all the replies people saying things to him i’m scrolling down there’s one tweet directly to me from this woman she says “you find rape funny” no no what no… “your mates find rape funny” no listen right “you find rape funny” listen everyone listen right no… i said to her “i didn’t tweet that” she went “you retweeted it” to show he’s an idiot “but you must find it funny or amusing it’s not a frivolous thing” i said “no well it’s up to him isn’t it he can do it” now i’m arguing with quite a nice sane person who thinks this is mental but i’m fighting for his right… to fantasize about me being raped by the devil because i’m so conscious of “freedom of speech”… what a topsyturvy world right although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit because she did that thing that people do she didn’t say “what you find jokes about rape funny” she said “what you find rape funny” the answer to that is no of course not no one finds rape funny not even rapists find rape funny know what i mean noone ever gives evidence saying “it was dark he wore a ski mask and he was giggling” that’s never… so… i sent back “you mean jokes about rape” she said “yes” i went “depends on the joke” “it fucking doesn’t” i’m going “no it does it does it depends on the joke it’s about context it’s about content what do you mean by a rape joke” she said “even a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it is unacceptable” i said “that’s ridiculous it depends what the joke is” i tweeted that clip of me in the office going “i think there’s been a rape up there” everyone gets that because of the context and the target is a middleaged man who’s so narcissistic he’ll say anything to win a silly game you have to understand the joke and where it comes from i said “some jokes don’t punch up or down they don’t punch anywhere they can just be a pun a play on words that don’t really mean anything” a joke went round when i was a kid even adults told it i’ll tell you a woman goes running into a police station she says “help i’ve been graped” the policeman says “do you mean raped” she says “no there was a bunch of them” that is a rape joke right so… and i even said to her “no i agree in most cases yeah real rape jokes they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target disgusting i’d never tell those but it depends on the joke not the word or the subject” i calmed it down and they agreed some jokes are worse than others she ended it by saying “well okay i see your point but… still… i will laugh at a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it when noone in the audience has been raped” i should have left it i just sent back “what a weird door policy” you turn up to a comedy gig pay your money someone says “can i just ask you a question” yeah have you ever been raped i have yes you can’t come in what why a lady says she won’t laugh if you’re in off you go that’s what the world is like people take everything personally they think the world revolves around them particularly on twitter i’m not tweeting anyone i’m just tweeting i don’t know who’s following me i’ve got 12 million followers they can be following me without me knowing choose to read my tweet and then take that personally that’s like going into a town square seeing a big noticeboard saying “guitar lessons” and you go “but i don’t fucking want guitar lessons” what’s this there’s a number here right call that are you giving guitar lessons i don’t fucking want any fine it’s not for you then just walk away don’t worry about it\n",
            "i should say one thing in twitter’s defense i use it as a marketing tool and for fun like everyone else but one great thing about twitter for me personally i’m very into anti animal cruelty years ago it would take ages to get 100000 signatures on a petition standing outside tesco’s or something that’s the magic number because then it gets heard in parliament i’ve been part of many campaigns through twitter when we’ve got 100000 signatures in days and the law has been changed thank you to those who’ve retweeted about animal cruelty it makes a difference thank you but even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty you think no one’s gonna argue with that yes they will they just wanna be heard i’ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment i say “ban bullfighting” someone always says “what about the kids in syria” what well i’m not giving you a choice you can do both i’m not saying “throw that kid back in the hole there’s a bull here” and there’s one thing that i didn’t want in my head but it exists so we have to deal with it now that i found out through twitter there’s a thing called the yulin dog meat festival in china every year and it’s horrendous and we send people with money to buy the dogs to bring them back it’s a drop in the ocean they eat thousands over this weekend i tweet the details the petition people don’t really read it it’s a kneejerk people say “racist” i go “what” they go “we eat pigs and cows in the west” yep we do i don’t but yeah i used to you’re right a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog it’s not about the species it’s what they do to these poor dogs what they do is torture the dogs first ‘cause they think it makes the meat taste better they beat them they blowtorch them they even skin them alive and i saw this picture… on twitter of the opening of this ceremony these two guys in this chinese square and they’re skinning this dog alive it’s screaming they’re laughing it’s the worst thing i’ve ever seen i thought “i’ve got to tweet that” i tweeted the picture with a petition and i just said “one beautiful creature and two ugly cunts skinning it alive” right and it took off loads of retweets it made the press i got one tweet back from a woman that said “is that language necessary” i should have left it right but i was… i was incensed i said “you’re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death” she said “i just hate the cword” i definitely should have left it i sent back “people who hate the cword would hear it a lot less if they didn’t go round acting like such cunts” thank you you’ve been fantastic good night cheers thank you so much thank you so much i hope you enjoyed the show i hope noone was offended no i really do that’s not the point i’ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things without being bad people i think it’s my upbringing i grew up… in poverty with nothing but the point was to pay your way then have a laugh that was the men the women carried on working it was my older brother bob it was him who i first saw making these dark jokes right in the bad situation as things were happening people were laughing i realized “he’s healing them” that’s what comedy’s for what humor’s for it gets us over bad stuff right typical bob story he once spent an hour in the pound shop in hayling island just asking the cashier how much everything was just to see if he could break this poor man’s will bob was the first person i saw answer back to authority the first authority you come across are your parents and he’d get in trouble he got sent to bed but i thought he’d won the argument and he’d tease my mum my mum was a typical workingclass woman as i say we lived in a shitty area right and most of the houses looked like a bit of mud and a stolen bike and fence posts missing she mended the fence turfed the garden herself painted the step she thought “if it looked respectable we’d be respectable” it was about reputation i guess bob would send her postcards that just read “is that pedophile postman still reading your mail” and she’d take it she’d go in and she’d be horrified she’d call bob “he saw it this time you must stop doing that” even at her funeral… my mum died first and my dad carried on for a year or so just drinking beer then he went at mum’s funeral we had different duties i did catering and flowers bob went to see the local vicar that was a mistake right we’d never been to church he didn’t know us we didn’t know him so he said to bob “tell me about your mum so i can say a few words” bob saw that as an opportunity right so bob with a straight face said “well she was a keen racist” the vicar went “i can’t say that” bob said “okay put she liked gardening” he was trying to get the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church he didn’t warn us and he did get something by the vicar so we’re called ricky robert– bob– ricky robert marsha and larry now larry is the oldest in his seventies born in the war i always thought he was the sensible one first born weight of the world on his shoulders my mum said when he was a teenager he got a job and gave her the money to help out he’s a standup guy larry so bob… gives the vicar the wrong name didn’t warn us we’re all in church start of the funeral we’re all there packed out the coffin comes down guided by the vicar the vicar goes to his pulpit all confident with his little notes right and he goes… eva leaves behind four loving children ricky robert marsha and barry and… we snort like that right bob’s going… everyone realizes we’re all laughing we see larry go… all right and the church is like… every time we thought of it we’d see larry go… like that right then we’d just start giggling just fits of fucking giggles right larry eventually started doing this and the vicar’s thinking “what have i said” right he’d put in a few things the vicar didn’t know that set us off again things that were just lies or slightly wrong my nieces and nephews started crying i’d come prepared with a pack of tissues they’d take one and hand it on before the funeral i’d taken the tissues out written on them folded them back and put them in and each tissue said “snivelling fucking bitch” and they’re sort of laughing so it was like a madhouse right everything the vicar said or did we all started fucking laughing right and you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit he ended the funeral and he made a beeline for me and bob he said “sorry was that okay” me and bob went “fucking brilliant mate it was fucking brilliant” that’s what i mean we’re all gonna die so we should have a laugh if you can laugh in the face of adversity you’re bulletproof me and my brother bob had one simple rule and that was if you think of something funny you’ve got to say it win lose or draw it might go well… it might go badly but you’ve gotta say it and bear that in mind as i leave you with this right… so… we’re all in the car one day bob’s driving packed in this car a little day trip to the beach we get stopped for a security check and there’s a british bobby there and he stops the car bob’s at the window he said “where are we off to” bob went “bognor” he went “can you just pop the boot please” so he looks at that looks in the boot like that back to bob’s window gets that mirror on a stick thing and he starts just looking under the car and as he does that his helmet falls off right and out of the helmet falls a packet of 20 cigarettes and the copper went “bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets” and bob went “i knew it wasn’t fucking brains” you’ve been amazing good night prolefeed your email address will not be published required fields are marked  \n",

            "hello hello how you doing great thank you wow calm down shut the fuck up thank you what a lovely welcome i’m gonna try my hardest tonight you’re thinking “relax we’ve had our money’s worth just seeing you” what you’re a legend shut up what is he i’m not a god i’m just an ordinary guy you know going round talking to people sort… sort of like jesus… in a way… but better well i’ve actually turned up so… thank you and welcome to my new show humanity i don’t know why i called it that i’m not a big fan i prefer dogs… obviously dogs are better people than people aren’t they they’re amazing dogs they’re our best friends they guard us they guide us there’s medical detection dogs that can smell if you’ve got… aids i’m not a doctor… but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours so they go “cor you’re well hiv fuck” you know and you go “you can smell aids on someone” yeah “why didn’t you smell it on the bloke i brought home last night you fucking idiot” they did the first three billion years by themselves evolution and all that then we got involved and did some selective breeding getting them how we wanted to do jobs for us bit stronger faster whatever they’re great at the jobs they’re bred to do they love the job they’re bred to do they’re genetically hardwired to love that behavior although the rhodesian ridgeback was bred to hunt lions i can’t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out so we’ve got all the pedigrees for miles around a big passingout parade there’s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard he goes “right dogs” they go “what” “who wants to know what job they got” “we all do we all do” “okay labradors” “yeah” “do you like carefully bringing back dead ducks” “yeah” “that’s your job” “amazing that is amazing that is my favorite job that is my favorite job” “jack russells” “yeah” “you like shooting down rabbit holes” “yeah” “that’s your job” “fuckin’ hell best day ever best day ever” “miniature poodles” “yeah” “do you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals” “yeah” “that’s your job” that’s your job “ridgebacks” “yo” “you’re hunting lions” “what” “you’re hunting lions” “fuck off” “yeah you are” “no we’re not look lions we’ll get fucking mashed why can’t the rottweilers hunt lions” “they’re shaking babies” good boy good boy you shake that baby if you want good boy cheers this is my first new standup for seven years if you don’t count the golden globes which you shouldn’t the golden globes very different god a different vibe two hundred million people watching and it’s live big thrill but with that many people watching there’s a bit of stick everyone’s different everyone’s a blogger everyone goes “i was offended” “why” “he said an horrible thing” “he said loads of horrible things” “yeah but that was a thing that i care about” that’s the thing about offense it’s about personal feelings i don’t care about the backlash “comedian in hot water” you know my girlfriend jane she worries and she reads things “what have you said” “don’t worry they won’t come to the house fuck ’em” so i wind her up i pretend i’m gonna say much worse things than i ever would i have to make up worse jokes than i actually… just to scare my girlfriend when i do the golden globes we go out about a week before it’s in la we fly out i’m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches they release more presenters i take my pick “i got a good intro for them yeah mel gibson i’ll introduce him yes” about three days before this last one just to wind jane up i said “i got a good intro” she went “what” i said “bill cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch please welcome helen mirren” i didn’t do it she said “you won’t do that” i said “no” next day i got her again i said “is this too much” i said “not even bill cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast please welcome melissa mccarthy” i didn’t do it i would never… i’d never… tell a joke like that it’s horrible i was just doing it to annoy jane i’d never even… think… of that so don’t… even on the day on the way to the red carpet in the limo i said “i’ll start with a funny oneliner an oldfashioned joke” she went “what” i said “what did the deaf dumb and blind orphan get for christmas” jane went “i don’t know” i said “cancer” i didn’t do it so… you’re getting offended at a joke that doesn’t exist so… i’d never say that in public so… to anyone who mattered anyway so don’t… i didn’t have to worry about offending anyone it just happens the big controversy last time i did it was a caitlyn jenner joke outrage on twitter the next day i mean a couple of people going “it was transphobic” it wasn’t transphobic in the slightest it was a joke about a trans person but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence and that’s the other thing about offense people mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target they’re not necessarily the same i’ll tell you the joke you make your minds up it’s live so they go “your host for the  annual golden globes awards please welcome ricky gervais” they’re all clapping the actors are smiling at me nervously it’s brilliant right so i just go “relax i’m gonna be nice tonight i’ve changed not as much as bruce jenner obviously” and i go “now caitlyn jenner of course” and what a year she’s had became a role model for trans people everywhere bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes she didn’t do a lot for women drivers…” that’s a clever joke i’ll tell you why right it’s layered no listen right the subject of that joke is stereotypes i’m playing with the notion of stereotypes i start by saying she’s a real woman a liberal progressive attitude then if she’s a real woman i hit them with the oldfashioned stereotype she must be a bad driver then right the target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car let’s not forget that shall we a celebrity killing someone in their car running home and popping on a dress that’s… the target of the joke just so we’re clear okay she was interviewed a week later at a press conference for a show of hers now cancelled and… one of the press said “what do you think of the ricky gervais joke” she went “maybe i should host the golden globes” and they tweeted that and ed me in because they want a celebrity feud it was clickbait i rose to the bait obviously… i just sent back “let her host just don’t let her drive” another website that was in the room entertainment weekly they tweeted a different headline and they ed me in their headline was “caitlyn finally breaks silence over ricky gervais” i just sent back “at last she always brakes too late” bring it on bring it on but i’m a considered comedian i like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair so i was engaging these people saying “why is it transphobic” they said “it’s about a trans person” that’s ridiculous that’s like saying a joke about bill cosby is automatically racist it depends on the joke but i’m willing to learn i found out my crime was that i deadnamed her i’d never heard that term before a day after the golden globes and that was saying her old name and even acknowledging she used to be a man but she did i saw him on the olympic games he was a decathlete he was in everything all over the place shot put and pole vault he won a medal he was famous he was on telly all the time you know a big… famous… man with a huge… i don’t know i’m guessing probably he was big but i’ve learnt my lesson now i know it’s wrong i’d never deadname her now but years ago when she was a… man… years ago i’m saying and she went to the… doctor… and… knocked on the door the doctor went “come in” this is years ago i’d never deadname her now but this is like… a flashback before anyone… you know what… so… so like “come in” and he went “hello bruce jenner” because that… that was his name… then the doctor– this was years ago… the doctor went “all right bruce jenner how you doing you fucker you big old lunk how you doing come here you you fucker how you doing brucie boy” and bruce jenner– that was his name this is years ago right so… bruce jenner went “yeah yeah not too bad doctor yeah” “what can i do for you bruce you fucker how you doing boy” and bruce jenner went– that was his name bruce jenner went… “look at that” the doctor went “come on bruce jenner you know the rules” he uses his whole name every time for some reason… “come on bruce jenner you fucker you know the rules you can’t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here mate” bruce jenner went “no that’s not my pole that’s my enormous penis” “well seeing as it’s your penis you can bring it in here but you should have left your shot puts outside” and bruce jenner went… that was his name for… fiftyeight years i think he went “no they’re not my shot puts doctor they’re my enormous testicles” that’s where i keep my testosterone and my spunk and shit right and the doctor went “oh yeah that makes perfect– i’m a medical man you’re a big bloke you fucker how you doing boy you’re a big… you’re big and you would have a big old… cock and… balls they’re beautiful” bit familiar innit “no you must be very proud of them bruce” bruce went “this is going to surprise you doctor i wanna get rid of them” and the doctor went “what why” “oh they get in the way” “in the way of what” “fucking driving for one thing” so i’m engaging these people and i’m saying “but i had to say her old name that’s the joke i say “i’ve changed not as much as bruce jenner” then i do the joke” but no this is my second crime i say she hasn’t changed she’s always identified as a woman that means she’s a woman fine if that’s the rules if you feel you’re a woman you are i’m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far in fact i don’t think it’s going far enough cause i’ve always identified as a chimp right well i am a chimp if i say i’m a chimp i am a chimp preop but… don’t ever deadname me don’t call me ricky gervais again from now on you call me bobo i’m gonna have species realignment i’m halfway there i’m short with short legs and long arms i stoop my back’s getting hairier by the day i’ve got fangs like that i love nuts i love nuts once i was at the zoo and people were looking at me so i just started masturbating like… so… i am a chimp right i am a chimp if i say i’m a chimp i’ve got to live as a chimp for a year then have hormones get me all nice and hairy that’d be lovely i’m gonna stay a male chimp… so i can keep all that right male heterosexual chimp keep the same girlfriend jane would be happy she loves me she loves chimps so… you know i reckon that’s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp we’re so close than for a man to turn into a woman in many ways a bit of hair and a top lip like that as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off… and a hole gouged out into– i’m not a doctor but that is… the gist of it i know which one i’d rather have done i’m not saying chimps are better than women no way right any ladies here i can’t see you but to me every single one of you is equal… to a chimp so… so i’d have all that done hair and that i’d do all that all the… i’ll retain the ability to speak english like in emergencies i’m talking to jane she’s going “what is it” “what is it bobo” “you left the fucking oven on there’s a fire” are you saying that if caitlyn jenner was being chased by a wolf and there was a big fence but she had a long pole she’d… revert she’d be over that fucking… easy so i’d have all that done top lip doing all that right i’ll be legally a chimp i’ll be well… properly chimpedup i’ll be able to use chimp toilets i’ll be walking along holding jane’s hand “come on bobo” right we don’t hold hands now i don’t know why she’s all over me now i’m a chimp but we’ll be all in love maybe matching jumpers “come on bobo” in love just two… like that then if a bigot in a van slows down and goes “that’s fucking disgusting” i’ll fling shit at him and run up a tree and that’s why that joke isn’t transphobic so… cheers so humanity what is humanity what are we well we’ve touched upon it there we’re great apes not metaphorically we’re literally great apes we are  genetically identical to a chimpanzee we’re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas we left our common ancestor about six million years ago we have the same life cycle same as any other animal which is… our parents mate… we’re born… we grow… we mate… our parents die… our friends die… and then we die now… my sevenyearold niece didn’t like hearing that but i said “you’ve gotta learn stop crying” i said “you’re seven you know… today so… any more grizzling and this party’s cancelled so…” let’s take the first of those birth it’s odd because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period i mean because of our evolution our brain is so big we have to get that huge head out early that’s why the skull is in parts and supple then we go on gestating outside the womb that’s why we’re so useless look at other mammals a giraffe is walking along it goes “i’m proper pregnant” right i’m gonna have a baby giraffe right here yeah there it is see you later and the baby goes “mum” it’s got to be fucking ready we’re… we’re helpless right just think nine months we’re growing in this perfect environment everything’s… it’s like being in a little kate bush video right then suddenly you’re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass you’re covered in shit there’s screaming you go “i can’t breathe” someone goes “yes you fucking can” the first one second of life on earth you don’t know where you are you can’t choose where you’re born i was born in whitley estate in reading right i wouldn’t have chosen that i’d have chosen hampstead i did choose hampstead it just took  years to be able to afford it very different very different my upbringing to how i live now now i live a privileged life hampstead is ridiculous it’s a rarefied place it’s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me new money right but growing up it was tough i don’t know about now but in my day my estate was rough and scary it felt like wildlife i was weak and vulnerable there was danger round every corner my school was on my street and i ran there every day so i didn’t get mugged or molested there weren’t many pedophiles in reading the murderers had killed a lot but there was still a couple i moved to hampstead oh my god there’s no crime i saw a knife once in hampstead it was a palette knife just a bloke oil painting in the middle of the street broad daylight noone gobbing on it or calling him “bender” it was weird i know my life has changed drastically it wasn’t always like that as a famous person you read about yourself gossip and twitter and everything one thing kept cropping up even as i prepared for this tour people kept saying “he’s out of touch he’s so famous he’s rich he’s megarich” i am right i could have this place burnt down for a laugh no but they say things like “he’s an observational comedian how can he say things that relate to ordinary… scum” and i say i say “don’t call them scum right” but even the papers they try and… get around to it i do interviews and they’ll always say “do you always fly first class” i go “no often private” right the number of times i’ve answered this question they say “do you know how much a pint of milk is” to make you look out of touch i don’t know but that’s irrelevant next time a journalist asks me i’ll say “i don’t know but here’s a grand run and get me one” is that enough that enough yeah another question i always get particularly with the posh sundays doing a profile piece they’re still trying to alienate you make you look different they say things like “you don’t have children” i say “no” “why don’t you have children” which is an odd question why don’t you have children as opposed to asking people “why do you have children” let’s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she’s had eight shall we nine that one just fell out that one didn’t even touch the sides or… disturb her cigarette that one just… go and claim for that people say it’s selfish to not have children how is it selfish to not bring a life into the world that doesn’t exist on any level there’s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going “we want to be born” right but i’ve thought about it and there’s three reasons i don’t have children three main reasons and i’ll share them with you three reasons one there’s millions the world’s overpopulated noone’s going “rick’s not having kids we’re gonna run out fuck” two kids are scroungers aren’t they i mean from day one it’s all “me me me” isn’t it “feed me” “clothe me” “pay for my chemotherapy” no… no not my problem son not mine luck of the draw boy luck of the draw it costs the average household in the west  to bring up a child and they don’t want to pay you back they’re not grateful they don’t go “thanks for having me” it’s “i didn’t wanna be born” even if they get a top job which they won’t you’ll never see that money back they’ll just put you in a home okay and my kid he’d be born into ridiculous wealth wouldn’t he so… he’d be a little cunt a little hampstead cunt… running around with all the other fucking little hampstead cunts being all hampstead and cunty “i’m a little hampstead cunt” yes i know “these are my cunty friends” i know it’s obvious i can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you’re little hampstead cunts you little posh hampstead… first he’d know he was a little hampstead cunt “i’m a little…” yes we know everyone knows right he’d know that right on the other hand he’d know he’d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad i’d say “i worked my way up from nothing and you’re just a useless hampstead cunt” he’d go “yeah” and that would probably prey on his little mind a bit eleven twelve he’d be naughty run with the wrong crowd try and get out from under my shadow then he’d turn to drugs about  he’d come home and overdose on my afghan rug twenty grand that was right and as he was there convulsing and throwing up his fucking lungs right and with his little posh highpitched fucking death rattle… his little fucking dying words he’d go “do you love me now daddy” no no no i never did that’s why you’ll never be born you useless fucking junkie hampstead cunt and three… i’d worry sick about him you know no i would i’ve only got a cat now and i worry sick about her i check the door three times when i go out so she doesn’t escape i put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she’s peckish a human baby oh my god the responsibility of a human life i’d watch it sleep you know we said how weak and vulnerable they are oh my god you perfect little thing oh you flesh of my flesh now go to sleep in your expensive cot like that night night sleep tight don’t let the bedbugs… dead yeah just… why why is it dead it’s just fucking dead look fuck’s sake fucking hell what the… what a fucking waste of time that was fuck’s sake embarrassing “jane” “what” “come here” “i’m in the shower” “come here” “what” “fucking dead already i didn’t… just fucking… fucking hell jane you call that a baby that is…” if jane was out i’d have to text her wouldn’t i what could you… “baby’s dead” she’d come back “what the fuck” i’d go “yep… forget the pampers lol” but even if it made it through the terrifying cot years and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables with their sharp edges i’d have to pad them so it didn’t run into it cave its head in and die then social services come round and say “is this your child mr gervais” “yeah” “what happened here then” i go “it’s a fucking idiot” i did think of adopting for a while a little third world child because that would tick all three boxes one i wouldn’t be adding to the population problem i’d be alleviating an existing problem a young kid born through no fault of his own into abject poverty he would have died i can literally save his life and give him a great upbringing right two he would be grateful wouldn’t he he’d wanna pay me back woudn’t he particularly if i let him know the other kids in the village weren’t so lucky they didn’t… they didn’t make it out right i’d tell him that early on so he really bucked his ideas up i’d go “tunde come here come here yeah yeah go and pop a shirt on you’re not in africa now that’s better yeah tunde look– yeah water straight out of a tap innit yes yeah yeah no it’s not free it’s hampstead you know but… yeah course it’s safe safe fresh drinking water have as much as you want have a bucket full fresh drinking water there you go go and clean the car go on” no i’d go “look remember all your friends in the village back in africa they’re all dead a rich man didn’t save them and bring them to hampstead do you wanna pay me back” “yeah” “yeah i bet you do” the good thing about them is they can start work when they’re about… six i just call up nike and i go… “do you still make your stuff in sweatshops got a great little worker here yeah pound a day’s fine he’s gotta start somewhere and three… if he ran round and caved his head in… and died and social services came round and said “is this your child mr gervais” i’d go “does it look like mine” i’d go… “this is hampstead it’s obviously broken in” that’s why i don’t have kids even though i don’t have children of my own people still show me photos of theirs like i give a shit i don’t mean my own family they’ve given up i’ve got older brothers and sisters they’ve had loads of kids and their kids have kids and then their kids there’s about  i don’t know all their names i see them at christmas it’s all “uncle ricky” they know i’ve got a bit of cash they go through my pockets and then fuck off it’s like being mugged by mice right i don’t mean them i mean strangers i could be busy i could be working like on the set of a tv or film or something stressed producing or directing it you get someone who’s in for one day with one line or a stuntman they introduce themselves “good be with you in a minute” then they hover “busy” i go “yeah yes yeah” they go “working the weekend” i go “not filming but i’ll be in the edit” “i’m taking my youngest to ballet lessons” “ah great great” “yeah she’s eight” “i’ve got a photograph” i go “you know what show me it if she goes missing i’ll keep an eye open in the woods” you’ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole and go “she’s beautiful” it’s gotta be long too short it’s awkward they know you go “yeah right” too long and it’s like “she’s… she’s fucking beautiful” it’s a minefield innit so… i’m not out of touch but i am spoiled there’s a difference i didn’t have any money until i was  i’ve got the same family friends and values but i am spoiled because opportunity and privilege spoils you and it doesn’t take much i’l give you an example when i first made it in america the next time we flew we’re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing and he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side the first time you’re horrified “everyone’s looking” pretending to be late baseball cap oh god next time we flew i went “where’s that bloke i’m not queueing” it’s quick when i fly to the states i’ve got a place there but i’m always working so someone else is paying so i go first class ba it doesn’t get any better even if i was paying i’d still go first class but jane would probably be in coach… it’s ten grand a pop that new planet of the apes movie’s on she’ll love that she’ll be up for that but when someone else is paying i say “jane get up here with me” right front two seats… they board us early we’re on the plane about  minutes before anyone else god they bring round these snacks these warmed caramelized nuts in a bowl champagne it’s great it’s like a day off no phone or anything it’s like a holiday flying to the states\n",
            "i could do without the safety video that’s always a bit of a downer and totally pointless if you hit the side of a mountain at  miles per hour the brace position does fuck all imagine if that worked you’re going down the plane smashes you go “i’ll try it” you do that ball of flames you wake up everyone’s dead you go “fucking hell that’s amazing that is” and they always use that voice don’t they that calming hypnotic voice like “nothing bad will happen” they’re saying horrendous things but nothing bad will happen because i’m using this voice don’t worry things like “in the event of the plane landing on water–” it smashes the fuck to bits right they say “in the event of the plane landing on water your life jacket is equipped with a whistle” a fucking whistle so the plane hits the water smashes to bits everyone’s dead except you by a miracle you’re bobbing around in the atlantic ocean four degrees that water is you’ve got about  minutes before hypothermia sets in or you’re eaten by a shark or you drown you’re hoping they’ve sent airsea rescue you’re going “god i’m gonna die i don’t know what i’m doing” hold on i mean air sea rescue… i don’t know if you’ve ever been in a helicopter o course you haven’t but… they’re fucking loud it’s like having your head in a washing machine you have to wear ear plugs and defenders your teeth rattle it’s like… like that over the atlantic ocean at night never gonna happen if you crash you die right but apart from that it’s brilliant right… i was flying heathrow to jfk just before christmas right boarded us early on the plane she comes round “champagne in a wine glass like you like it mr gervais” she goes off i go “have you got any of them warm nuts” she went “we’re not handing out nuts on this flight a lady’s getting on who’s so allergic even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction” i went “oh my god of course” i was fuming i mean… what’s that got to do with me why can’t i eat nuts just cause… fucking… this woman will… die right nuts how has she lived this long if walking by a nut kills you… if being… just near a nut… how has she never been near a nut… before and how has she lived long enough having never been near a nut how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane right honestly it’s… and if being near a nut kills you do we really want that in the gene pool i mean… i never wanted nuts more i felt she was infringing on my human right to eat nuts and this is how spoiled i am okay i actually had this thought i thought “oh i wish i’d brought my own nuts on” right i thought for a second but that wouldn’t work she’d get on and start blowing up like a frog right like that… and… die and someone would go “ricky gervais brought his own nuts on” you know right so i don’t take my own nuts on now before i fly i have a shower and then i rub myself all over… in nuts… just in case then i go “can i have any nuts” they go “no sorry this lady would die” “yeah not a problem” lady gets on sits down starts blowing up like a frog… i go “what’s the matter” i touch her all over “what’s the matter” she goes “nuts” right and dies and i go “who’s been eating nuts” i get off scotfree so i got to america i went on a chat show tonight show with jimmy fallon and i told that story the whole thing it went well audience laughed great went out next day on twitter outrage by “outrage” i mean one person going “how dare you” this woman goes “i saw you on jimmy fallon making fun of nut allergies my daughter’s nutintolerant how dare you” i go “who is this woman” she’s tweeted  times she starts ing nbc and jimmy fallon i go “what’s this how many followers twentythree ignore it” you know when you’re being told off and they use your own words against you like a teacher going “so you find so and so funny” and cause the teacher’s really angry yes you do find that thing funny whatever… she said… “would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog” yeah yeah you saying that… yes if you said that at the funeral i would yeah… so someone else gets involved ohio moms against nuts right and she does a blog and they’re talking to each other and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting i am one filmed her little girl put it on youtube and sent me it i opened it sweet little girl seven years old and she went “dear mr gervais i have a fatal nut allergy” delete not my problem right ignore ignore ignore right but then one of them said something that reeled me in just cause i’m this selfconfessed twitter police i try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means particularly in the context of comedy and in the context of a joke a joke about a bad thing isn’t as bad as the bad thing or necessarily condoning the bad thing it could be anti the bad thing it depends on the actual joke and this woman said… “you should never make jokes about food allergies” i should have left it right i sent back “i make jokes about aids cancer famine and the holocaust and you’re telling me i should never joke about food allergies” she sent back “yes but the holocaust didn’t kill children” well… it did didn’t it it was horrible the holocaust some would say as bad as food allergies “didn’t kill children…” jesus it did kill children hitler killed  million people many of them children i have to say hitler you couldn’t make him up the worst human being to walk the face of the earth he is a crazy… evil racist narcissistic serial killer just terrible but… if i was throwing a dinner party and i’d been slaving over a hot stove and i was getting everything ready and there was one place left and i had to… either invite hitler or that little girl with food allergies… i know who’d ruin that party more everyone’s enjoying it “everything okay” “ja ist yummy” right he’s loving it i go “cheers you fucker how you doing boy” she’s going “i can’t eat that” fucking hell “who wants ferrero rocher” “me” “all right here” “i can’t eat them” oh fuck off home right\n",
            "that’s what the world’s like people see something they don’t like they expect it to stop as opposed to deal with their emotions they want us to care about their thing as much as they do it’s why the world is getting worse and the world is getting worse i think i’ve lived through the best  years of humanity…  to  the peak of civilization for everything for tolerances for freedoms for communication for medicine now it’s going the other way a bit last couple of years just a little blip maybe i’m not saying this because i’m old old people say things like “oh everything was better when i was a kid” course it was you were a kid everything’s better when you’re a kid being old is the shit bit whatever’s happening being old is… i wake up these days and i go “oh fuck i didn’t die” gotta do it all again i’m usually hung over headache liver pains i can’t walk for the first five minutes ’cause i’ve got no joints in my knees i’m getting fat again now right i was thin till i was about  proper skinny like nine and a half stone then i got a job right and the next sort of  years were what i call my eating years… and i just got steadily fatter and fatter until i reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness when i was about  years old there was one christmas i was at home lying on the floor… and… i was saying to jane “i’m having a heart attack” right and honestly my heart rate was like  i felt nauseous i had palpitations i was sweating because i’d eaten eleven sausages true story right i was like one of them snakes like when you see a big like… python swallow a pig whole and then it’s just fucked it’s like… it’ll sit there for a week it’s like a duffel bag just there like that that was me right i wasn’t having a heart attack but it worried jane she said “you gotta look after yourself” i thought “you’re right ” so i started working out right every day i didn’t give anything up i don’t eat meat anymore but i was having   calories a day including wine every night but i burnt it off the next day just so i could do all that i worked out every day running weight training… i had more time on my hands than the average person i had a gym in my house i had no excuse i lost  pounds it was great but now i still eat and drink too much but i physically can’t… burn off the calories i can’t do enough cause i’m so old and broken and tired so i’m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again and this time i am going to die i’m losing my hair it’s getting really thin i know it looks great from there cheers but… no honestly in a lift with that light directly overhead and the mirror it looks like an xray right i’ll have to buzz that off soon i’d never wear a wig oh my god if you wear a wig or a toupee and you think you’ve got away with it… you haven’t everyone knows everyone knows immediately my brain knows a wig has come into the room before i do right i could be at a party it’ll go “there’s a wig in here” i go “is there” “yes there is yeah” spidey senses for the wig it’s obvious the way they smile like nothing’s wrong hiya it’s the telltale signs isn’t it i was put off wigs for life by my uncle reginald great bloke he’s dead now died a few years ago i was only little he went bald in his twenties tragically bald his hair fell out it might have been something like alopecia but he was bald for ten years into his thirties turns up one day at our house… “elvis what is–” i was about eight i said to auntie edna “what happened” she went “it was a miracle” they were lying they were just… everyone knew he was bald but he’d embroiled his family in the lie so they had to lie as well they’re going “yeah it just grew back” there’s so much he wouldn’t do cause he was terrified of the wig coming off we weren’t allowed balloons at parties right auntie edna said “reg is allergic to balloons” he wasn’t allergic he was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater and his wig would fly across the room we’ve got photos in the family album if he’s at a wedding or a christening and he’s holding a baby it’s always at arms’ length like that so it can’t grab his wig it must have been on his mind all the time right it was the only thing he feared the wig coming off in public and this ridiculous lie being exposed he was in the army hard as nails he wasn’t scared of anyone or anything spiders snakes… cancer… how’s the chemo going uncle “not a problem” we’ve got a photo of him the last year i think he was  it must have been the last year he was alive it was a hot day he was in the garden in his little trunks he was a wizened little man by then white chest hair jet black wig still died in it buried in it he’s wearing it now a little skeleton with jet black hair like posh spice for eternity but i knew that was gonna happen i knew i would get old and fat and… ill and blind and deaf and… shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket you’re ready because you’re warned you know about getting old what they don’t talk about so you’re not prepared and it was a shock to me… i only found out recently i’ll share it with you now the distending testicles see you don’t know about it but it happens in your fifties i wasn’t checking them or anything… i didn’t see ’em for  years as a young man they were pert and now they’re like two plums in a sock i don’t know when it happened but it was recently they just… and this is how i found out so as i’ve been getting older and they’ve been secretly stretching away… as i’ve got older i’ve got richer so my baths have been getting more luxurious last year i moved into a new house in hampstead big bath big sunken bath southfacing windows i was in there the first night lovely bath sun streaming in classical music this is the life i looked down and they’re floating right now i’d never dreamt that testicles would float they seem like they’d be heavy you could tie things down with them and they’d sink you know most people never see their… in the sea you’re in trunks in the shower they dangle and baths aren’t usually that deep that was my first thought “oh my god i never thought testicles would float” then my second thought kicked in “hold on this bath’s two feet deep” right i’m sitting on the bottom they’re on top what’s going on right and… i looked and my testicles are now longer than my penis easily by some way right in fact they’d created a little fleshy sort of life raft right my penis was dry just nestled just… floating on top like that like that just bouncing around i should have given it a little whistle i’m just thinking “this is bizarre” fucking hell right and… i thought “maybe it’s a fluke” so i held them under the water for a minute i let them go and they bobbed up they’re really… they’re really buoyant right try it when you get home if you’re in your  and a man obviously or caitlyn jenner but… but the world is getting worse and i blame the beginning of its demise on social media because twitter and facebook that’s where this ridiculous notion bred and became stable that it was more important to be popular than right everything was “like me” “agree with me” it falls into two tribes “i don’t agree with them so i block them” and now in this posttruth era people don’t care about the argument they say “who’s saying the argument no they’re not on our side” it’s ludicrous okay and it also bred this ridiculous notion we’ve always had my opinion is worth as much as yours now it’s my opinion is worth as much as your fact which is nonsense i get tweets from people saying “i believe the earth is  years old” “i believe you’re a fucking idiot” you can’t have an opinion on the age of the earth you can have opinions but not your own facts but it was all about being popular right and even politicians picked up those symptoms politicians tweet now they want to be popular we had a brexit referendum cause they passed the buck they didn’t want to make a mistake and there’s a ridiculous thing of “let’s ask the average person what they think” let’s stop asking the average person what they… do you know how fucking stupid the average person is we still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say “do not drink” right let’s take those labels off right for two years and then have a referendum but it’s not just politicians even real news the news on tv says things like “tweet us your news” don’t let them tweet you the news “i saw a tyrannosaurus rex” you liar right there was a big news story last year about a train crash that happened a year before and there was an inquiry the results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news he said “we’ve looked at everything and we’ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor so we’re going to slow them down a bit statistically this shouldn’t happen again” that would have been it but the guy went “we asked the public what they thought” then there was three banal vox pops first one said “i already pay £ a year so i’m not happy” the next one said “it takes me  minutes each way it’s not good enough” the last one said “i say it’s better to arrive at work late than dead” why is that on the news and when is that applicable in any situation all right ted you’re in early ted oh ted we’ve been through this remember i said i’d rather you arrive late than dead but… the big enemy is stupidity… right i wanna share with you the most stupid tweet i ever got now admittedly when i first got on twitter i pushed my agenda i was an outspoken atheist not to change anyone’s opinions i thought it was important to tell the other side there are still  countries where people are put to death for being an atheist i just wanted to say “it’s fine to be an atheist it’s fine to believe in god and it’s fine not to” that’s all i was saying i realized i didn’t have to tweet about religion or atheism i could tweet a fact and that annoyed just the right people i’d tweet things like “happy birthday earth four point six billion years old today” someone would always go “we know what you’re fucking doing” this is a tweet i got after one of those and… it was all in capitals which excited me… that’s the sign of twitter madness mixed with anger it’s great right i looked at his profile sure enough he’s a gentleman from texas he’s a fundamentalist creationist christian which is fine he loves god he loves god and… fetuses mainly he loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay and then he’s… remember it’s in capitals he’s shouting at me best tweet ever “your science–” my science right science by the way is spelled scients already good isn’t it i mean… he’s obviously heard the word he took a guess… never seen it written down because it’s not in the bible so he’s… “your scients won’t help you… well it will it’s helping him… beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me “your scients won’t help you when satan…” of course he believes in satan why not he believes that god made the universe in six days you’re not gonna say to him “do you believe in satan” and have him say “bit farfetched” why doesn’t god kill satan that’s… what i’d ask him if i was wrong and i met god i’d go “oh you do exist” he’d go “yeah” i’d go “i’ve got a few fucking questions mate the first one would be “why did you make chocolate kill dogs” mental right also if you hate homosexuality so much why did you put the male gspot up the arse what… what is wrong with you then i’d say “why don’t you kill satan” and he’d go “what” i’d go “why don’t you kill satan if he does all the bad stuff and you do all the good stuff which you want… i mean you do want–” “yes yeah” “you could kill him if you wanted you can do anything easy” “yeah” “why don’t you kill him then” “because… shut up” “your scients won’t help you when satan is raping your british ass” and he’s got a point because if i die and i find myself in hell being raped by satan… science has pretty much let me down but it’s this last line that he just throws away the line he signs off with makes this the best tweet i’ve ever received “your scients won’t help you when satan is raping your british ass i’ll be laughing” so… he’s there too he’s… so he’s a fundamentalist… christian who’s lived his life by the old and new testaments he dies he wakes up in hell right which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma… “oh my god i’m in hell oh my god why have you forsaken me i’m gonna be tortured for eternity” he sees me getting raped and goes “ha ha ha” he’s suddenly over it is he his day’s suddenly got a little bit brighter and like he’s not next right so i’m getting raped right by the devil right he’s just there “you fucking atheist scum” and i’m like that “yeah whatever” i assume it happens all eternity “yeah yeah whatever” like that i might say “watch your hooves on my testicles” and he’d go “why are they so distended” and i go “oh like you’re brad pitt” you know what i mean sorry are we talking or raping can we… “you lying fucking atheist” he’s probably bored “fucking atheists every fucking day” right his little gargoyle comes up “satan” he goes “what” and i go “yeah what” he goes “there’s a fundamentalist christian” “fuck this” he’d be on him like a ton of bricks so… i got that tweet i loved it all i did was retweet right and just watch the fun people piling on going “ah loser” and he’s fighting back really witlessly saying things like “go fuck your sister you english faggot” that makes no sense at all i forgot about it went and did something else few hours later on twitter again it’s still all going off right it’s really funny i’m laughing at all the replies people saying things to him i’m scrolling down there’s one tweet directly to me from this woman she says “you find rape funny” no no what no… “your mates find rape funny” no listen right “you find rape funny” listen everyone listen right no… i said to her “i didn’t tweet that” she went “you retweeted it” to show he’s an idiot “but you must find it funny or amusing it’s not a frivolous thing” i said “no well it’s up to him isn’t it he can do it” now i’m arguing with quite a nice sane person who thinks this is mental but i’m fighting for his right… to fantasize about me being raped by the devil because i’m so conscious of “freedom of speech”… what a topsyturvy world right although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit because she did that thing that people do she didn’t say “what you find jokes about rape funny” she said “what you find rape funny” the answer to that is no of course not no one finds rape funny not even rapists find rape funny know what i mean noone ever gives evidence saying “it was dark he wore a ski mask and he was giggling” that’s never… so… i sent back “you mean jokes about rape” she said “yes” i went “depends on the joke” “it fucking doesn’t” i’m going “no it does it does it depends on the joke it’s about context it’s about content what do you mean by a rape joke” she said “even a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it is unacceptable” i said “that’s ridiculous it depends what the joke is” i tweeted that clip of me in the office going “i think there’s been a rape up there” everyone gets that because of the context and the target is a middleaged man who’s so narcissistic he’ll say anything to win a silly game you have to understand the joke and where it comes from i said “some jokes don’t punch up or down they don’t punch anywhere they can just be a pun a play on words that don’t really mean anything” a joke went round when i was a kid even adults told it i’ll tell you a woman goes running into a police station she says “help i’ve been graped” the policeman says “do you mean raped” she says “no there was a bunch of them” that is a rape joke right so… and i even said to her “no i agree in most cases yeah real rape jokes they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target disgusting i’d never tell those but it depends on the joke not the word or the subject” i calmed it down and they agreed some jokes are worse than others she ended it by saying “well okay i see your point but… still… i will laugh at a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it when noone in the audience has been raped” i should have left it i just sent back “what a weird door policy” you turn up to a comedy gig pay your money someone says “can i just ask you a question” yeah have you ever been raped i have yes you can’t come in what why a lady says she won’t laugh if you’re in off you go that’s what the world is like people take everything personally they think the world revolves around them particularly on twitter i’m not tweeting anyone i’m just tweeting i don’t know who’s following me i’ve got  million followers they can be following me without me knowing choose to read my tweet and then take that personally that’s like going into a town square seeing a big noticeboard saying “guitar lessons” and you go “but i don’t fucking want guitar lessons” what’s this there’s a number here right call that are you giving guitar lessons i don’t fucking want any fine it’s not for you then just walk away don’t worry about it\n",
            "i should say one thing in twitter’s defense i use it as a marketing tool and for fun like everyone else but one great thing about twitter for me personally i’m very into anti animal cruelty years ago it would take ages to get  signatures on a petition standing outside tesco’s or something that’s the magic number because then it gets heard in parliament i’ve been part of many campaigns through twitter when we’ve got  signatures in days and the law has been changed thank you to those who’ve retweeted about animal cruelty it makes a difference thank you but even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty you think no one’s gonna argue with that yes they will they just wanna be heard i’ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment i say “ban bullfighting” someone always says “what about the kids in syria” what well i’m not giving you a choice you can do both i’m not saying “throw that kid back in the hole there’s a bull here” and there’s one thing that i didn’t want in my head but it exists so we have to deal with it now that i found out through twitter there’s a thing called the yulin dog meat festival in china every year and it’s horrendous and we send people with money to buy the dogs to bring them back it’s a drop in the ocean they eat thousands over this weekend i tweet the details the petition people don’t really read it it’s a kneejerk people say “racist” i go “what” they go “we eat pigs and cows in the west” yep we do i don’t but yeah i used to you’re right a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog it’s not about the species it’s what they do to these poor dogs what they do is torture the dogs first ‘cause they think it makes the meat taste better they beat them they blowtorch them they even skin them alive and i saw this picture… on twitter of the opening of this ceremony these two guys in this chinese square and they’re skinning this dog alive it’s screaming they’re laughing it’s the worst thing i’ve ever seen i thought “i’ve got to tweet that” i tweeted the picture with a petition and i just said “one beautiful creature and two ugly cunts skinning it alive” right and it took off loads of retweets it made the press i got one tweet back from a woman that said “is that language necessary” i should have left it right but i was… i was incensed i said “you’re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death” she said “i just hate the cword” i definitely should have left it i sent back “people who hate the cword would hear it a lot less if they didn’t go round acting like such cunts” thank you you’ve been fantastic good night cheers thank you so much thank you so much i hope you enjoyed the show i hope noone was offended no i really do that’s not the point i’ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things without being bad people i think it’s my upbringing i grew up… in poverty with nothing but the point was to pay your way then have a laugh that was the men the women carried on working it was my older brother bob it was him who i first saw making these dark jokes right in the bad situation as things were happening people were laughing i realized “he’s healing them” that’s what comedy’s for what humor’s for it gets us over bad stuff right typical bob story he once spent an hour in the pound shop in hayling island just asking the cashier how much everything was just to see if he could break this poor man’s will bob was the first person i saw answer back to authority the first authority you come across are your parents and he’d get in trouble he got sent to bed but i thought he’d won the argument and he’d tease my mum my mum was a typical workingclass woman as i say we lived in a shitty area right and most of the houses looked like a bit of mud and a stolen bike and fence posts missing she mended the fence turfed the garden herself painted the step she thought “if it looked respectable we’d be respectable” it was about reputation i guess bob would send her postcards that just read “is that pedophile postman still reading your mail” and she’d take it she’d go in and she’d be horrified she’d call bob “he saw it this time you must stop doing that” even at her funeral… my mum died first and my dad carried on for a year or so just drinking beer then he went at mum’s funeral we had different duties i did catering and flowers bob went to see the local vicar that was a mistake right we’d never been to church he didn’t know us we didn’t know him so he said to bob “tell me about your mum so i can say a few words” bob saw that as an opportunity right so bob with a straight face said “well she was a keen racist” the vicar went “i can’t say that” bob said “okay put she liked gardening” he was trying to get the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church he didn’t warn us and he did get something by the vicar so we’re called ricky robert– bob– ricky robert marsha and larry now larry is the oldest in his seventies born in the war i always thought he was the sensible one first born weight of the world on his shoulders my mum said when he was a teenager he got a job and gave her the money to help out he’s a standup guy larry so bob… gives the vicar the wrong name didn’t warn us we’re all in church start of the funeral we’re all there packed out the coffin comes down guided by the vicar the vicar goes to his pulpit all confident with his little notes right and he goes… eva leaves behind four loving children ricky robert marsha and barry and… we snort like that right bob’s going… everyone realizes we’re all laughing we see larry go… all right and the church is like… every time we thought of it we’d see larry go… like that right then we’d just start giggling just fits of fucking giggles right larry eventually started doing this and the vicar’s thinking “what have i said” right he’d put in a few things the vicar didn’t know that set us off again things that were just lies or slightly wrong my nieces and nephews started crying i’d come prepared with a pack of tissues they’d take one and hand it on before the funeral i’d taken the tissues out written on them folded them back and put them in and each tissue said “snivelling fucking bitch” and they’re sort of laughing so it was like a madhouse right everything the vicar said or did we all started fucking laughing right and you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit he ended the funeral and he made a beeline for me and bob he said “sorry was that okay” me and bob went “fucking brilliant mate it was fucking brilliant” that’s what i mean we’re all gonna die so we should have a laugh if you can laugh in the face of adversity you’re bulletproof me and my brother bob had one simple rule and that was if you think of something funny you’ve got to say it win lose or draw it might go well… it might go badly but you’ve gotta say it and bear that in mind as i leave you with this right… so… we’re all in the car one day bob’s driving packed in this car a little day trip to the beach we get stopped for a security check and there’s a british bobby there and he stops the car bob’s at the window he said “where are we off to” bob went “bognor” he went “can you just pop the boot please” so he looks at that looks in the boot like that back to bob’s window gets that mirror on a stick thing and he starts just looking under the car and as he does that his helmet falls off right and out of the helmet falls a packet of  cigarettes and the copper went “bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets” and bob went “i knew it wasn’t fucking brains” you’ve been amazing good night prolefeed your email address will not be published required fields are marked  \n",

goes \\u201coh you\\u2019re being silly what do you care for you\\u2019ve partied way more than i have in my life\\u201d and i went \\u201cthat is not true i\\u2019ve gotten wasted way more than you have but i have in no way partied way more than you have often i get wasted just by myself i wouldn\\u2019t call it a party\\u201d for most of my career i was a struggling comedian right and this is how struggling comedians party right it\\u2019s  am monday right we\\u2019re in a onebedroom apartment seven of us are standing around a coffee table trying to stretch out two grams of coke one of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories\\u2026 and the rest of us are talking about where women might be one of us has come up with a plan the plan goes like this \\u201cwell\\u2026 nurses will be finishing their shift soon maybe if we just stand out the front of the er they\\u2019ll appreciate seven funny guys\\u201d  i don\\u2019t\\u2026 you know i\\u2019ve never partied like a model i have partied twice in my life twice like really partied i\\u2019ve had good nights out but i\\u2019ve really partied twice if you really party and most people never experience this it\\u2019s an amazing thing it happens in vegas it can only happen in vegas and it\\u2019s gotta involve celebrity right i\\u2019m not famous but the people around me were super famous and i was at this party in the night club and they took me in and then there\\u2019s the night club but then there\\u2019s the real night club out the back which is like the size of this stage it\\u2019s only a little room and you go back there and you can just\\u2026 they encourage you to take drugs in the open and you\\u2019re just doing it off a key  and they\\u2019re going \\u201cno dude use the table don\\u2019t use your\\u2026\\u201d and i go \\u201coh oh oh sorry um\\u2026\\u201d and it\\u2019s confusing at first and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room just bring \\u2019em in like \\u201chuh\\u201d and you can do this you can go\\u2026 \\u201cuh\\u2026\\u201d like that and they\\u2019ll drag these women away it is the best thing you\\u2019ll ever do with your life when you party that hard as a man there\\u2019s a lot of remorse \\u2019cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money you wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover and you go to your friends you go \\u201coh my god we partied so hard last night i spent \\u201d when a hot girl parties that hard she wakes up in the morning and goes \\u201coh my god we partied so hard last night i made \\u201d and that\\u2019s a vastly different emotion that\\u2026 i don\\u2019t think women will never\\u2026 yeah okay this is the thing in america at the moment they\\u2019re trying to raise the minimum wage to i don\\u2019t know  an hour or something like that and whenever they bring up this argument they always go \\u201cand still to this day women only earn  of what men earn in the workplace\\u201d and of course that\\u2019s disgusting how dare women earn so much like\\u2026 a lot of things that i say tonight will be jokes that i don\\u2019t actually mean but this is something i\\u2019m really passionate about women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace i\\u2019m sorry i\\u2026  i\\u2019m not being a misogynistic bastard right i\\u2019m not saying that women don\\u2019t work as hard i\\u2019m sure they do i\\u2019m not saying they don\\u2019t do as good a job what i\\u2019m saying is they don\\u2019t deserve to earn as much money as men right men need that extra  to buy meals and drinks and jim jefferies tickets and all that shit  now\\u2026 i\\u2019m sure there\\u2019s women in this room that are saying \\u201coh i pay for my drinks i bought my own ticket\\u201d and don\\u2019t think we don\\u2019t appreciate the uglies \\u2019cause we do right we do but there\\u2019s little things in society that you can\\u2019t change men have extra expenses that you\\u2019ll never understand there\\u2019s holidays that are just for women like valentine\\u2019s day is just for women they say it\\u2019s for romantics they say it\\u2019s for couples or something like that it\\u2019s just for women there\\u2019s no man who gets excited by valentine\\u2019s day there\\u2019s no man that when he sees the valentine\\u2019s day decorations go up in the shopping mall he goes \\u201coh valentine\\u2019s day is coming\\u201d valentine\\u2019s day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head and it goes like this \\u201chow much money do i have to spend today so that you won\\u2019t act like a cunt\\u201d it doesn\\u2019t stop there mother\\u2019s day mother\\u2019s day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old my girlfriend\\u2019s first mother\\u2019s day and she went \\u201coh i wonder what i\\u2019ll get for mother\\u2019s day\\u201d and i went \\u201cprobably fucking nothing he\\u2019s got no money he\\u2019s six months old what do you think he\\u2019s gonna buy you\\u201d within an hour her friends were over at the house just by coincidence telling me what a bad person i was and how important mother\\u2019s day is to a new mum you know and so i went and bought her a cappuccino machine \\u2019cause i assumed that\\u2019s what hank would have wanted her to have\\u2026 and i wrote a card i\\u2019m not a bastard i wrote a card i\\u2019m righthanded so i got my left hand every new dad knows this you get the crayon and you go  \\u201chappy mother\\u2019s day love hank\\u201d and i went \\u201chan\\u2026\\u201d and then i did the \\u201ck\\u201d backtofront because he\\u2019s a fucking moron see now i know there\\u2019s people in the room they\\u2019re thinking \\u201cwell fathers have father\\u2019s day\\u201d father\\u2019s day is bullshit it\\u2019s fucking shit father\\u2019s day father\\u2019s day came around and my girlfriend went \\u201cwhat do you want for father\\u2019s day\\u201d and i went \\u201ci don\\u2019t want anything don\\u2019t even worry about it i don\\u2019t want anything\\u201d and she goes \\u201ccome on you gotta have something\\u201d i said \\u201chonestly i don\\u2019t want anything\\u201d and she goes \\u201ccome on\\u201d and i went \\u201cit\\u2019s my fucking money just don\\u2019t touch it just leave my money alone how hard is this how about for  hours you don\\u2019t touch my fucking money that would be a gift\\u201d that\\u2019s why every single father has that one father\\u2019s day gift that they cherish and it\\u2019s shit it\\u2019s like a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handle\\u2019s too big and it says \\u201ci heart dad\\u201d and they keep that for  fucking years this mug and do you wanna know why they like it every now and again they look at it and go\\u2026 \\u201cthat cost me nothing that mug\\u201d  see\\u2026 wouldn\\u2019t it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff but didn\\u2019t cost anything that everyone could participate in right i\\u2019ve got it right april \\u2026 anal sex day  it\\u2019s good isn\\u2019t it everyone\\u2019s girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on april  it\\u2019s nice a month before you\\u2019d be walking around the shopping center going \\u201coh the decorations are up\\u201d  and it\\u2019s good \\u2019cause if your bird didn\\u2019t take it in the ass you could do the same thing that women do on valentine\\u2019s day when they don\\u2019t get a gift you could go like \\u201coh me mate jason his wife took it in the ass twice yeah obviously they\\u2019re more connected than we are they\\u2019ve uh\\u2026\\u201d i\\u2019m thinking i don\\u2019t do much merchandise after my shows and stuff but i\\u2019m thinking of bringing out some april  tshirts not even putting \\u201cjim jefferies\\u201d on them or anything just tshirts that say \\u201capril \\u201d \\u2018cause it\\u2019s good right you\\u2019re in a bar you\\u2019re a guy you see a guy at the other end of the bar with an april  and you go\\u2026 fucking friends for life right but even better you see a girl with an april  tshirt the weird thing is i\\u2019m biggingup anal sex here and i don\\u2019t even really like fucking girls in the ass that much i\\u2019m not even a huge fan i much prefer the cunt i think it\\u2019s a much more\\u2026 i think that a cunt is a much more purposebuilt thing to fuck but you know anal sex\\u2026 oh you know\\u2026 i do it i get involved \\u2019cause i feel like i have to you know i\\u2026 but i\\u2019ve never been a big fan of the ass fucking i uh\\u2026 when i watch it on porn it seems very inviting the girl\\u2019s taking it so fluently in her ass and she seems to be having fun and uh\\u2026 but the thing is you can\\u2019t smell porn you don\\u2019t smell porn you just\\u2026 you just watch it they never\\u2026 and it\\u2019s different porn it\\u2019s different they clean the girl\\u2019s asshole they pump water into it until it\\u2019s very hygienic i\\u2019m sure and the girl seems to be so happy she\\u2019s like\\u2026 you\\u2019ve got it in her pussy you\\u2019re fucking her and then she\\u2019s like \\u201cput it in my ass\\u201d she\\u2019s inviting it\\u2019s like you\\u2019re doing her a favor in porn and then she\\u2019s like\\u2026 she says things\\u2026 i don\\u2019t know things like \\u201ci\\u2019m enjoying that keep putting it in my ass fuck my ass i love a cock in my ass\\u201d and\\u2026 and the experience i\\u2019ve had in my own life has been vastly different i\\u2019ve\\u2026 my experience has been a lot of crying now although that can help you come at times it\\u2019s not what you want\\u2026 it\\u2019s not what you want for every day i like the girl who acts like she\\u2019s enjoying it like you know when your girlfriend\\u2019s like \\u201ci\\u2019m gonna act like i enjoy it\\u201d she does that whole \\u201cyeah oh no that\\u2019s good\\u201d  ahh \\u266a i\\u2019m having a good time \\u266a and then they\\u2019re always going \\u201care you done are you close to done\\u201d you never fuck a pussy and they go \\u201care you almost done finish this\\u201d like that if you\\u2019re fucking ass they don\\u2019t want you\\u2026 they want it all over quick and they do other things the porn girls i don\\u2019t know how much they get paid i\\u2019m sure it\\u2019s more than what the men get paid it\\u2019s the opposite bit of society um\\u2026 but they do a thing called \\u201catm\\u201d i don\\u2019t know if you know what that is kids that stands for \\u201cass to mouth\\u201d that\\u2019s where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus and she\\u2019ll put it directly in her mouth and she\\u2019ll say something like \\u201ci love the taste of my ass let me taste my ass\\u201d and then the man as a favor to this woman puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work\\u2026  she\\u2019s been doing now i had a drunken night with my exgirlfriend where she thought she\\u2019d be all wild and try that once again vastly different experience i\\u2019m not a big fan of the ass fucking and i don\\u2019t know of any man if they\\u2019re truthful really is now there\\u2019s women in the room who are thinking \\u201cwell why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass\\u201d  what a good question  women the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because\\u2026 we know you fucking hate it  so\\u2026 i\\u2019m a father um\\u2026 i love my son i love my son the same way that i love cigarettes i like to hold him for five minutes every hour and the rest of the time i\\u2019m thinking about how he\\u2019s fucking killing me he\\u2019s a good little boy no he\\u2019s a great little fella i really like him um\\u2026 my girlfriend super loves him though it\\u2019s fucking creepy and\\u2026 i\\u2019m glad i have a son that worked out good for me i wouldn\\u2019t be a good father to a girl it wouldn\\u2019t be good for me nothing weird wouldn\\u2019t fuck it i\\u2026 i just don\\u2019t get along with women you know how it is i don\\u2019t want them in my house and\\u2026 so\\u2026 because you dream see\\u2026 for example okay when hank was born\\u2026 the couple over the road within two weeks of hank being born had a baby girl and rightly or wrongly the first thing that went through my head was\\u2026 \\u201caw that\\u2019s great i hope hank fucks that one day\\u201d that\\u2019s what i think\\u2026 \\u2018cause that\\u2019s what i think about my son i hope when he\\u2019s of age he just fucks everything i don\\u2019t care if my son is gay or straight all i care about is when he is of age that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires that is my dream for my son  but never in the history of fathers and daughters has a father held his baby girl and gone \\u201coh i hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life i hope you\\u2019re never shy of a cock i hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up\\u201d right you know\\u2026 and it\\u2019s not just me women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well my girlfriend goes to the gym every morning i go there very occasionally and when you go to the gym there\\u2019s a little daycare cr\\u00e8che thing in the gym where you can hand your child off and inside that daycare there\\u2019s like three women in their  they\\u2019re very nice ladies and you hand your kid off and he plays then when you finish your workout you come and get him and there\\u2019s a woman that works there who just loves my son she sees all the other kids but she loves hank and hank fucking loves her and the two of them light up when they see each other and it\\u2019s super cute i bring hank up the stairs and he starts going \\u201cuh uh\\u201d trying to reach at her all right and she does this she goes \\u201ceveryone my boyfriend\\u2019s here here\\u2019s my boyfriend give him here he\\u2019s my boyfriend\\u201d and then she kisses him and she goes \\u266a my boyfriend gives me kisses my boyfriend gives me kisses \\u266a it\\u2019s fucking adorable but i tried doing that with a baby girl\\u2026 let\\u2019s say you go to the gym and there\\u2019s a daycare and me and a couple of my mates are working there \\u201chey everyone\\u2026 me girlfriend\\u2019s here give her here give her here she\\u2019s my girlfriend my girlfriend gives me kisses you know that right she\\u2019s always giving me kisses enjoy your workout don\\u2019t worry about a thing\\u201d   so\\u2026 also\\u2026 it\\u2019s just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter it\\u2019s just little things even when they\\u2019re babies it\\u2019s just easier there\\u2019s a wiping technique when you\\u2019re wiping a baby\\u2019s ass i don\\u2019t know if you have children but this is how you do it the baby lays on its back you put their feet together you lift the feet up and then you go in and wipe with a boy you can wipe like that up and down side to side whatever the fuck you want right with a girl you gotta wipe downward and away downward and away it\\u2019s very important that you wipe away from the cunt very important \\u2018cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts they do they fucking hate it boys don\\u2019t give a shit fucking\\u2026 my son will have shit all over his dick and balls and i\\u2019ll be cleaning it off under the foreskin and he\\u2019ll be laughing like it\\u2019s the best day ever even at my age now i find it funny if i have shit on my dick if i fuck my girlfriend in the ass i pull out i\\u2019ve got shit on my dick i\\u2019ll ring me mate jason up and go \\u201chey jason\\u2026 it\\u2019s happened again i got shit on my dick\\u201d and he\\u2019ll tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick and we\\u2019ll laugh and laugh and laugh but never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and she\\u2019s thought \\u201coh i can\\u2019t wait to call karen\\u201d   when you\\u2026 when my girlfriend got pregnant\\u2026 when you meet\\u2026 when you haven\\u2019t got a child couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children whenever you meet couples with children they\\u2019re always like \\u201cit is the most fulfilling thing i\\u2019ve ever done with my life my heart grows larger and larger every day\\u201d and then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant those same people went like this \\u201cyou\\u2019re never gonna sleep again  forget about it it\\u2019s over you\\u2019re not gonna sleep\\u201d they\\u2019re constantly telling you you\\u2019re not gonna sleep raising a baby is not that hard i\\u2019ll tell you what it\\u2019s easier than a coke habit i had a coke habit for sevenandahalf fucking years at least it\\u2019s not me who wakes up crying anymore i can sleep through other people crying i\\u2019ve had girlfriends that\\u2019s like white noise to me i find it soothing see me and my girlfriend just two months we went \\u201cfuck it let\\u2019s have a kid\\u201d fucking did it right these other people man\\u2026 you know these couples and they date from high school and then they go out for a bit longer and then after being together for like seven years they go \\u201cwe\\u2019re getting engaged you wanna come to the party\\u201d and you wanna say \\u201cno you\\u2019re really boring and we hate you\\u201d but you go \\u201coh okay great you\\u2019re still together are you you fucked one person have you oh how exciting\\u201d and\\u2026 and then what they do is they don\\u2019t have a kid right away because they\\u2019re still not ready \\u201cwe have to see how our careers are going and shit\\u201d and what they do is they get a dog and then they act like the fucking dog\\u2019s their baby they refer to it as their fucking baby they send you a christmas card of them holding the dog\\u2026 and it says \\u201cfrom our family to yours\\u201d and then you have a barbecue and you invite them the humans right then they come over this fucking dog runs in jumping over everything and you\\u2019re like \\u201cwhat the fuck is this shit\\u201d and they\\u2019re like \\u201cwe had to bring him we bring our baby everywhere\\u201d and you go \\u201cwell your baby is biting my actual baby can you control\\u2026\\u201d and then eventually they decide they\\u2019re gonna have a kid \\u2019cause they\\u2019ve learned so much from the dog and then they bring the kid back and the dog runs up like \\u201cwhat\\u2019s happening a new person\\u201d and they\\u2019re like \\u201cfuck off we don\\u2019t love you anymore we\\u2019re going\\u201d and they think they\\u2019ve learnt something from the dog and they haven\\u2019t learnt anything what happens if your girlfriend\\u2019s away on work and the dog dies you go off you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog\\u2026 try to pass it off as the same dog what happens if your girlfriend\\u2019s away on work and the baby dies very hard\\u2026 to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have easier if you\\u2019re black or asian  boston no no no shut up i will not put up with racism at my shows okay i\\u2019m not saying \\u2019cause they look the same i\\u2019m saying \\u2019cause they\\u2019re easier to purchase   if angelina jolie and madonna have taught us anything\\u2026 it is that you can buy black and asian people i\\u2019m yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from norway with a child going\\u2026 \\u201cyolanda quick get hans bring him over come on\\u201d  i\\u2019m gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit uh\\u2026 gun control now\\u2026 no wait before you\\u2026 don\\u2019t get excited because the other people have guns the antigun people are like \\u201cyeah do it jim\\u201d no let\\u2019s just\\u2026  now before i start saying this i wanna say this right i believe in your right as americans to have guns i\\u2019m not trying to stop you from having guns all i\\u2019m saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion my opinion on the\\u2026 oh it doesn\\u2019t matter i don\\u2019t like guns right i\\u2019m gonna say some things that are just facts right in australia we had guns right right up until  in  australia had the biggest massacre on earth it still hasn\\u2019t been beaten and\\u2026 now after that they banned the guns now in the  years before port arthur there was  massacres since the gun ban in  there hasn\\u2019t been a single massacre since i don\\u2019t know how or why this happened uh\\u2026 maybe it was a coincidence right now please understand that i understand that australia and america are two vastly different cultures with different people right i get it in australia we had the biggest massacre on earth and the australian government went \\u201cthat\\u2019s it no more guns\\u201d and we all went \\u201cyeah all right then that seems fair enough really\\u201d now in america you had the sandy hook massacre where little tiny children died and your government went \\u201cmaybe\\u2026 we\\u2019ll get rid of the big guns\\u201d and  of you went \\u201cfuck you don\\u2019t take my guns\\u201d  so here\\u2019s where it gets confusing right now as i said i am all for your second amendment rights i think you should be able to have guns it\\u2019s in your constitution what i am not for is bullshit arguments and lies there is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun and this is the argument\\u2026 \\u201cfuck off i like guns\\u201d it\\u2019s not the best argument but it\\u2019s all you\\u2019ve got and there\\u2019s nothing wrong with it there\\u2019s nothing wrong with saying \\u201ci like something don\\u2019t take it away from me\\u201d but don\\u2019t give me this other bullshit the main one is  \\u201ci need it for protection i need to protect me i need to protect my family\\u201d really is that why they\\u2019re called \\u201cassault rifles\\u201d is it i\\u2019ve never heard of these fucking \\u201cprotection rifles\\u201d you speak of protection what the fuck are you talking about you have a gun in your house you\\u2019re  more likely to use that gun on yourself than to shoot someone else and people think \\u201cwell that\\u2019d never happen to me\\u201d you don\\u2019t know that because you know what\\n\\u266a from time to time we all get sad \\u266a \\n\\u266a one day you\\u2019re happy then you\\u2019re sad \\u266a \\n\\u266a and then uhoh \\u266a\\nprotection i had a breakin in manchester england where i was tied up i had my head cut they threatened to rape my girlfriend they came through the window with a machete and a hammer and americans always go  \\u201cwell imagine if you had a gun\\u201d and i\\u2019m like \\u201call right i was naked at the time i wasn\\u2019t wearing my holster i wasn\\u2019t staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through\\u201d what world do you live in where you\\u2019re constantly fucking ready you have guns \\u2019cause you like guns that\\u2019s why you go to gun conventions that\\u2019s why you read gun magazines none of you give a shit about home security none of you go to home security conventions none of you read padlock monthly none of you have a facebook picture of you behind a secure door going \\u201cfucking yeah\\u201d like you\\u2019re going to be ready if someone comes into your house you have it at all fucking times by the way most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking tv you think that people are coming to murder your family how many fucking enemies do you have jeez you think a lot of yourself if you think everyone\\u2019s coming to murder you see if you have it readily available it becomes unsafe you have it in your bedside table one of your kids picks it up thinks it\\u2019s a toy shoots another one of your kids happens every fucking day but people go \\u201cthat\\u2019d never happen in my house \\u2019cause i\\u2019m a responsible gun owner i keep my guns locked in a safe\\u201d then they\\u2019re no fucking protection someone comes into the house you\\u2019re like \\u201cwait there fuckface oh you\\u2019ve come to the wrong house here buddy boy i tell you what i\\u2019m gonna fuck you up okay is it  to the left or  to the right your mother\\u2019s birthday why the fuck would i know your fucking mother\\u2019s birthday maybe if you didn\\u2019t leave the window open  \\u2018because it\\u2019s too hot in here\\u2019 we wouldn\\u2019t be getting fucking murdered right\\u201d i find the nra to be hard work the fact that they always think the answer is more guns after sandy hook happened the nra said and i quote \\u201cnone of this would have happened if the teachers had guns\\u201d i\\u2026 i think they\\u2019re forgetting what school was like does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to\\u2026 whenever she came into school that relief teacher came you and your friends would see her and go  \\u201coh we\\u2019re gonna make her cry\\u201d and then she\\u2019d stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking and you\\u2019d go \\u201cyou\\u2019re never getting married are you miss never gonna happen for you\\u201d then she\\u2019d get back to her  volkswagen beetle and she\\u2019d be crying over the steering wheel just \\u201cwhy don\\u2019t they like me\\u201d let\\u2019s give that cunt a gun and see how things work out  and then they go \\u201coh well answer to that we\\u2019ll just add more guns\\u201d they go \\u201cwe\\u2019ll put an armed security guard at every school across america\\u201d yeah that\\u2019ll work out the average security guard in america earns  an hour not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero someone comes onto the school and\\u2026  and you\\u2019ve got kevin now i\\u2019m sure kevin\\u2019s shithot at call of duty but it might not fucking cut it ladies and gentlemen now i understand that when i\\u2019m doing this joke in this room  of you agree with me  of you don\\u2019t agree with me and i do respect the people who don\\u2019t agree with me don\\u2019t think i don\\u2019t out of the  that don\\u2019t agree with me  of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and it\\u2019s not to be taken seriously and they\\u2019re laughing along \\u2019cause it\\u2019s just funny jokes right and then the next  have sort of phased out a little bit they\\u2019re looking around going \\u201cwonder how they got that chandelier up there\\u201d and then\\u2026 there\\u2019s the last  and they\\u2019re fucking furious right now in this room and the people watching at home\\u2026  of you are fucking seething just\\u2026 and for a couple of reasons first reason i\\u2019m making good points  second reason second reason second reason and this is the big one i\\u2019m foreign\\u2026 and that\\u2019s pissing the fuck out of you right now and your brain is on a loop and you can\\u2019t fucking turn it off and it\\u2019s just going around in a circle and you\\u2019re just going \\u201cif you don\\u2019t like it go home if you don\\u2019t like it go home\\u201d and my answer to that is \\u201cno\\u201d i came here legally i pay my taxes i\\u2019ll say whatever the fuck i want your first amendment means that i can say the second amendment sucks dicks and\\u2026 unless you\\u2019re an american indian you\\u2019re a fucking immigrant as well so fuck off people get so precious about it i understand that to americans your constitution is very important i respect it but please understand that every country has one as well it\\u2019s no more special than any other constitution we have one in australia i don\\u2019t know what it says i\\u2019ve never seen it if there\\u2019s a problem we\\u2019ll check it but everything\\u2019s going fine and don\\u2019t get me wrong i get that the constitution is important to you i have had\\u2026 fucking i get it right i\\u2019ve had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as i\\u2019m leaving the theater going  \\u201cyou cannot change the second amendment\\u201d and i\\u2019m like \\u201cyes you can it\\u2019s called an \\u2018amendment\\u201d if you can\\u2019t change something that\\u2019s called an \\u201camendment\\u201d see many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution and if you don\\u2019t know what a thesaurus is get a dictionary and work your way forward don\\u2019t think your constitution is set in stone you\\u2019ve changed things before you used to have prohibition in there right and then people were like \\u201chey who likes getting fucked up yeah i like getting fucked up too let\\u2019s get that one out let\\u2019s get that one out\\u201d you used to have this other thing in america called uh\\u2026 slavery and then lincoln came along and went \\u201cthat\\u2019s it no more slaves\\u201d and  of you went \\u201cfuck you don\\u2019t take my slaves\\u201d and the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns \\u201cwhy should i have my slaves taken off me i\\u2019m a responsible slave owner i\\u2019m trained in how to use my slaves safely just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesn\\u2019t mean that my rights should be taken away from me i\\u2026 i use my slaves to protect my family i keep my slaves locked in a safe\\u201d that\\u2019s the thing \\u201cwhy should i have my guns taken off me i\\u2019ve done nothing wrong\\u201d look i agree with you if you\\u2019re a responsible gun owner and you don\\u2019t fuck around with them then you should be allowed your guns you really should but that\\u2019s not how society works we have to play to the  that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us we have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving right i take drugs like a fucking champion right  we should all be allowed to take fucking drugs but we can\\u2019t can we because sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids oh \\u201coh thanks sarah you fucked it up for everyone\\u201d right everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it right but we can\\u2019t because jonathan got drunk and ran over a family \\u201cthanks jonathan now i have to drive at  you fucking idiot\\u201d see that\\u2019s the thing \\u201cwhy should i have my guns taken off me i\\u2019m responsible just because that guy\\u2019s crazy\\u201d who\\u2019s to say you\\u2019re not crazy that\\u2019s the thing about crazy people they don\\u2019t know they\\u2019re crazy that\\u2019s what makes them crazy the only thing you know for sure on this earth is \\u201ci think therefore i am\\u201d you know that you exist anything past that is open to interpretation right you know you exist and that\\u2019s it right now i think i\\u2019m in boston talking to  people that\\u2019s what i think i\\u2019m doing but there is a good to fair chance that i\\u2019m in a mental home standing in front of a white wall going  \\u201ci hate guns i hate guns i hate guns\\u201d  see one of the better arguments is \\u201cwell if you take the guns away then only the criminals will have guns\\u201d not true when they banned the guns in australia it worked when they banned them in britain it worked okay the bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in sandy hook costs like  american and you can buy it in walmart it\\u2019ll be delivered to your house that\\u2019s it man  bucks right that same gun in australia on the black market costs  now if you have  you don\\u2019t need to be a criminal you\\u2019ve got  you\\u2019re a great little saver keep going so that covers the criminals but that doesn\\u2019t cover the people who wanna murder your family that are coming after you and your family it kind of does the people who do the massacres it covers them \\u2019cause they go\\u2026 the kid at colorado who thought he was the joker let\\u2019s say that he had some social issues the kid at sandy hook was asperger\\u2019s as fuck right i don\\u2019t know if you know a lot about the black market but you can\\u2019t just rock up at the docks going  \\u201cguns who wants to sell me a gun\\u201d now i\\u2019m gonna wrap this up we won\\u2019t talk about it anymore now\\u2026 see the one thing that i do really agree with with the right to bear arms i really agree with\\u2026 that the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government in case the government became a bunch of cunts you could all get your guns and fight back and that\\u2019s why it was written \\u2013  \\u2013 yeah and that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets but you do know the government has drones right you get that you\\u2019re bringing guns to a drone fight if we went back to muskets i\\u2019m all for it keep the second amendment if we all have muskets\\u2026 muskets are awesome every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times you know what\\u2019s good about the musket it gives you a lot of time to calm down someone calls your wife fat and you\\u2019re like \\u201cfuck you buddy ah you\\u2019re not a bad guy you\\u2019re all right\\u201d now\\u2026 after the show we\\u2019re gonna go out have a big party around boston see how it goes i\\u2019m not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore my girlfriend has said that\\u2019s a no\\u2026 \\u2019cause i don\\u2019t behave myself in there so i\\u2019m not allowed to go to them anymore \\u2018cause strip clubs aren\\u2019t what women think they are  it used to be like\\u2026 okay so when a man goes to a strip club it\\u2019s all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible that\\u2019s what men want to see women when they go to their magic mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are\\u2026 women wanna see a guy \\u201chey ladies he\\u2019s a fireman\\u201d and he comes out with his hose and like that\\u2026 and whenever a stripper takes their clothes off they\\u2019ve still got the fireman\\u2019s hat on or a tool belt on or policeman\\u2019s gun on a holster right because even when a man\\u2019s naked a woman wants to know that he has a job when men watch strippers we want them to have a job and that job\\u2019s stripping we want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money and just go\\u2026 \\u201cyou can\\u2019t take care of your kids\\u201d it\\u2019s\\u2026 and when men get private dances in these strip clubs i don\\u2019t know\\u2026 i don\\u2019t know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms but basically it\\u2019s dry humping there\\u2019s no dancing the girl gets in front she gets where your cock is pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it\\u2026 and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face and you go\\u2026 that\\u2019s what a private \\u201cdance\\u201d is right i don\\u2019t know if there\\u2019s private dancing in female strip clubs  i can\\u2019t imagine that there would be i don\\u2019t imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going\\u2026 she goes \\u201chow was it\\u201d and she goes \\u201cwell\\u2026 he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals\\u2026 and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead i got to go to the atm\\u201d so legit got canceled  yeah i know i know it who would\\u2019ve thought it would\\u2019ve struggled on that great fxx channel that everyone knew about the first season is on netflix this special is being recorded for netflix so you can go watch it there if you\\u2019re watching the special it was\\u2026 i\\u2019m very proud of it we had two great seasons of really good television and if people didn\\u2019t\\u2026 now\\u2026 the whole tv show is based around one standup routine that i used to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that i took to a brothel which is a true story and so when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who\\u2026 in the end we used dj qualls and dj qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie road trip he\\u2019s the skinny white guy out of the movie hustle  flow and he\\u2019s the white guy out of the movie hustle  flow now\\u2026 the great thing about dj is\\u2026 he already looks disabled he has that \\u201clatter stages of aids\\u201d thing going on it\\u2019s great for casting anyway but\\u2026 i didn\\u2019t want dj to begin with i wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic and the actors\\u2019 union of america said \\u201cyou cannot do that\\u201d because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy i think are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired and i said \\u201call right what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer\\u201d and they sent me a list and on this list i said \\u201ccan you get rid of all the contagious ones and what have we got left\\u201d so i saw every disabled actor in hollywood and i\\u2019ll be honest with you not that many of them i don\\u2019t know why maybe they\\u2019re just lazy they don\\u2019t wanna work maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly and none of them were very good either everyone we saw none of them were very good \\u2019cause acting is all about what you do with your hands none of them knew what to do with their hands and\\u2026 they all came in until this one guy came in i had seen a lot of people that day this guy was the most disabled person i\\u2019d ever seen in my life he was like\\u2026 think of the most disabled person you\\u2019ve seen then double it \\u2026really super disabled he was shaped like a pretzel he was being carried in by this big russian nurse carried him in he made that great disabled sound of\\u2026  that one i just loved him anyway\\u2026 so he comes in for the audition\\u2026 and i\\u2019m sitting there and we\\u2019re doing the lines together and at first i didn\\u2019t know if he was mentally all there either so i was being a little bit patronizing i was going \\u201cthank you so much for coming in\\u201d and then we did the dialog together and i didn\\u2019t have to worry about a thing this kid was funny he was smart his timing was impeccable i thought he was just great and i helped him out of the room and i come back to the director and i said \\u201cthat\\u2019s our guy that\\u2019s who we gotta pick\\u201d and he agreed but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room so the next bloke wheels himself in now obviously he\\u2019s just a paraplegic if he\\u2019s wheeling himself in which means the waist down and that didn\\u2019t really suit me because\\u2026 paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance but i thought\\u2026 \\u201cif he\\u2019s a good enough actor maybe he can quadup for the role\\u201d so he comes in\\u2026 he comes in i shake his hand and his leg slightly comes out at the same time and i went \\u201cwhoa what\\u2019s going on there kicky\\u201d and he goes\\u2026 \\u201coh you got me i\\u2019m not disabled\\u201d and i said \\u201cyou\\u2019re fucking what now\\u201d and he goes \\u201ci\\u2019m not disabled i just really wanted the role so i rented a wheelchair\\u201d and i said \\u201cjust shut up so let me\\u2026 this is how your day has mappedout thus far you woke up this morning you drove to the wheelchair rental place you rented a wheelchair you carried it out i assume you put it in the trunk of your car you drove here you got the wheelchair out you carried it up three flights of stairs you went to the waiting room you put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse then you sat in it and practiced your lines\\u201d and he went\\u2026 \\u201cyeah\\u201d and i said \\u201cyou\\u2019re a fucking asshole mate get the fuck out of here\\u201d and i kicked him out and later on that day i\\u2019m sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors i\\u2019m gonna call to tell them they\\u2019ve got parts and i\\u2019m holding this disabled guy\\u2019s headshot and i just think \\u201ci\\u2019m gonna call this guy up i\\u2019m gonna change his life this is an awesome moment right\\u201d and i\\u2019m looking at it and he looks super handsome in his headshot he looked really like\\u2026 and i thought \\u201cthis has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history\\u201d the shutter on his camera has gotta be like\\u2026  like\\u2026  and then i read the guy\\u2019s biography\\u2026 and then it dawned on me \\u201cthis guy\\u2019s not disabled either i hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair this cunt rented a nurse\\u201d do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse i\\u2019m all for a method actor get into character three hours before but once you finish the audition stand up and go \\u201ctada\\u201d and we would have gone \\u201cthat was very good\\u201d but i\\u2019ll tell you what you don\\u2019t do don\\u2019t make me carry you to your car i carried him down three flights of stairs going \\u201cyou did very good\\u201d he\\u2019s like \\u201cthank you jim\\u201d   i was uh\\u2026 i go to a therapist\\u2026 \\u2019cause i get depressed so i got a therapist every now and again i literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like \\u201ci\\u2019m gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind\\u201d like just out of the movies right and she went \\u201cred\\u201d and i went \\u201cblue\\u201d and then she went \\u201ccooking\\u201d and i went \\u201cfood\\u201d and all that type of stuff we went like this forever and then she went\\u2026 for the last question she went \\u201cand what\\u2019s your favorite thing in the world\\u201d and i went\\u2026 \\u201ccoming on a girl\\u2019s face\\u201d now\\u2026 now i could\\u2019ve said things like\\u2026 \\u201cice cream\\u201d is a good answer \\u201chank\\u201d would\\u2019ve been an excellent answer but i said \\u201ccoming on a girl\\u2019s face\\u201d and i\\u2019ve had six months to think about my answer and i stand by it \\u2013 i\\u2026 \\u2013  i\\u2019m not proud of it i hate myself for thinking it it\\u2019s such a horrible thing to do to another human when a girl\\u2019s on her knees and you\\u2026 it\\u2019s so\\u2026 and as an atheist i believe in darwin and all the things that he wrote but he never had a bit where he explained that there was never a bit in his book where he went \\u201cwhen a caveman loves a cavewoman he\\u2019ll ejaculate on her face so that flies won\\u2019t come near\\u201d there was never that\\u2026 never that moment but by golly if it\\u2019s not fun i find it\\u2026 to\\u2026 look to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time may i say \\u201cbravo\\u201d don\\u2019t\\u2026 don\\u2019t think what you do\\u2026 has gone unnoticed we notice we appreciate your work i think you deserve a parade of some kind during memorial day after the vietnam vets before the first gulf war guys we could bring in \\u201cand here\\u2019s the women who take a load on their

that illegal i don\\u2019t know is it illegal because a a child touched my cock or because b i found it really funny and i\\u2019ve been telling everyone and i can\\u2019t get angry at him because his whole life he\\u2019s been lying on mats with things dangling over he\\u2019s been training for this his entire life i think i\\u2019ve uh\\u2026 i think i\\u2019ve become american more american than i am australian lately and there was a moment where i tipped over where i went \\u201coh i think like an american person now\\u201d and i\\u2019m happy to do it i just\\u2026 i\\u2019ll tell you what happened i was flying around\\u2026 i was doing a tour of australia and i was flying domestically around australia and i\\u2019m so used to airports and stuff here in america that\\u2026 okay what happens is when you go\\u2026 i was flying sydney to melbourne when you fly domestically in australia you go up to the machine put your name in prints your ticket out it prints your bag thing you put the bag thing on your bag yourself and then there\\u2019s a conveyor belt underneath you throw your bag on bag fucks off you don\\u2019t speak to anyone then i go up to the gate bit and the lady\\u2019s going \\u201ctickets please\\u201d and i\\u2019m holding my id out like a fucking simpleton \\u2018cause i get through airports quick man i\\u2019m like \\u201cfucking there you go\\u201d and she went \\u201cput your id away i don\\u2019t need to see that\\u201d and i went\\u2026 \\u201ci think you do\\u201d and she went \\u201ci don\\u2019t\\u2026 why would i need to see your id\\u201d and i said \\u201ci might be a terrorist\\u201d and she went \\u201cwould showing me your id stop you from blowing the plane up\\u201d \\u201cno i\\u2019d probably still blow the plane up\\u201d so then i get up to the tsa conveyor belt thing and i\\u2019m so good at the airports i\\u2019m already taking my shoes off as i\\u2019m walking right and all the australians behind me assume that i\\u2019m american and they\\u2019re losing their fucking shit they\\u2019re like \\u201coh for fuck\\u2019s sake one of these cunts eh\\u201d and the tsa guy goes \\u201chey mate what are you taking your shoes off for\\u201d and i went\\u2026  \\u201ci don\\u2019t know maybe they\\u2019re bombs\\u201d and he went\\u2026 \\u201cbut they\\u2019re not are they\\u201d i put me shoes back on i get my laptop out everyone\\u2019s going mental and the tsa guy says very politely but extraordinarily sarcastically he goes \\u201cjeez mate that\\u2019s a nice computer why are you showing it to everyone\\u201d \\u201cit might also be a bomb\\u201d and then the guy said the most australian thing i\\u2019ve ever heard come out of anyone\\u2019s mouth ever he went\\u2026 \\u201coh come on mate you wouldn\\u2019t have two bombs\\u201d   i\\u2019m not even quite sure what that means but it does make some type of sense all right oscar pistorius if you haven\\u2019t been following the case you\\u2019re missing out this is the greatest thing since oj simpson you\\u2019re fucking missing out mate if you don\\u2019t know who oscar pistorius is let me fill you in oscar pistorius is a legless man from south africa known as the blade runner he ran in two olympics the disabled and the ablebodied olympics in one year no one has ever done that he\\u2019s an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and ablebodied people alike and on valentine\\u2019s day last year he shot and killed the hottest girl on earth\\u2026 and that\\u2019s when he became an inspiration to me\\u2026 \\u2019cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there you can\\u2019t just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want  people have feelings you cunts now there\\u2019s a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day one of the theories is that they found in her phone\\u2026 he went through her phone and on her phone he found some text messages from a south african rugby player on valentine\\u2019s day right now i don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever been to south africa but in south africa rugby is more popular than legless running it goes rugby legless running cricket legless running\\u2019s their second sport you wouldn\\u2019t have thought that anyway\\u2026 i\\u2019m going to reenact what i believe happened that day to do that i will now be doing a south african accent now i know many of you can\\u2019t tell the difference between my accent and a south african accent here\\u2019s the difference picture my accent but i\\u2019m punching a black person what i\\u2019m trying to say is south africans are horrible people so\\u2026 she\\u2019s coming out of the shower she\\u2019s been drying her hair she\\u2019s listening to rodriguez or something she comes out he\\u2019s laying on the bed he looks up at her he\\u2019s holding the phone and he goes  \\u201cwhat the fuck is this i\\u2019ve been through your phone you have been texting a rugby player\\u201d and she\\u2019s like \\u201coh fuck you who the fuck do you think you are\\u201d \\u201cwho am i i\\u2019m oscar pistorius the greatest legless runner that has ever been that\\u2019s who the fuck i am\\u201d \\u201cwell i would rather be with a rugby player at least he is a whole man not a threequarter man like you\\u201d \\u2013  \\u2013 i know  \\u201coh fuck you\\u201d \\u201cno fuck you i\\u2019m leaving you\\u201d and then she storms out of the room and then he was like\\u2026 \\u201cyou fucking bitch  i hate you  you will rue the day\\u2026 that you left oscar pistorius the blade runner don\\u2019t go anywhere  i hate you\\u201d that\\u2019s where he keeps his legs all right then he put the blades on \\u201coh you\\u2019re in trouble missy i tell you i go to my gun safe\\u201d she locked herself in the bathroom he shot her through the bathroom door seems like overkill doesn\\u2019t it bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them but oscar\\u2019s one of the few men on earth that couldn\\u2019t kick the door in right he was wearing the blades so\\u2026 boing ah so\\u2026 i think oscar will probably go to prison now\\u2026 in south africa one in four people have aids i assume it may even be worse in the prison population now can i say this look\\u2026 i\\u2019ve never raped a man i hate that i have to put \\u201ca man\\u201d in that sentence but whatever i\\u2019ve never raped a man but\\u2026 if i was going to rape a man it would be a legless olympian\\u2026 \\u2019cause in prison it\\u2019s all about getting one up on other people and making people think you\\u2019re tough and all that like \\u201cyou want to fucking rape me i just raped an olympian bitch is that what you fucking want\\u201d there\\u2019d be a wonderful moment\\u2026 when you\\u2019re in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a terminator movie  you know what i like about that joke so often when you tell a joke the rapist is the villain in the story but not in that one not in that one he\\u2019s the hero all right we have to get going soon before i leave \\u2013 i thank you very much for coming \\u2013  no i said \\u201csoon\\u201d not \\u201cover\\u201d it\\u2019s just soon you cunts so calm down   i always\\u2026 i always find that weird when someone like whistles like

right \\u2019cause i had a business class ticket so i didn\\u2019t give a fuck and when i travel economy i try to dress up nice \\u2019cause i like to look good in case someone recognizes me and i might get an upgrade but when i\\u2019ve already got a business class ticket i try to look like a bag of shit\\u2026 \\u2019cause it\\u2019s important to me that everyone else in business class doesn\\u2019t want me there and they\\u2019re annoyed by my presence so\\u2026 i\\u2019m wearing a white tshirt that\\u2019s got brown stains on it with a hole in the side i\\u2019m wearing these

lounge have some peanuts enjoy a beverage listen to rodriguez and if something opens up we will move you back up to business class so i thought \\u201cthere\\u2019s nothing i can do\\u201d so i walk

around the pylon and i went \\u201cyou can fuck off and all you don\\u2019t know what i\\u2019ve been through i\\u2019ve been downgraded\\u201d and as i said that  other people who were given the same lie that i was given that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class the penny dropped none of us are getting promoted they all lied to us and we formed an angry militia in seconds it was like a scene out of braveheart and they all stood up and went \\u201cfucking downgraded\\u201d and the woman in the group was doing this \\u201cdon\\u2019t speak to me that way who the hell do you think you are\\u201d and all the men in the group were like \\u201chey why don\\u2019t you shut the fuck up just shut the fuck up\\u201d \\u266a it doesn\\u2019t matter these people seem

and i reacted like he was one i went \\u201cneil diamond\\u201d and neil diamond went  \\u201chey what\\u2019s going on\\u201d and then for a second there there was a bit of my brain that thought

girls they could just eat like shit and then they take a shit and have a sixpack right they got thatthat beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there\\u2019s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through and then when they go to sleep they just go to sleep right they don\\u2019t have insomnia yet they don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to

it\\u2019s undetectable in men it\\u2019s really fucked up hpv is a ghost that lives inside men\\u2019s bodies and says \\u201cboo\\u201d in women\\u2019s bodies my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv either i have the kind that\\u2019s gonna turn into cervical cancer\\u2026 \\u2026or i have the kind where my body will heal itself very helpful this doctor right so basically either i\\u2019m gonna die\\u2026 or you\\u2019re in the presence of wolverine bitches we\\u2019ll find out um i can also tell that i\\u2019m getting older because my kindle is turning into a selfhelp library i\\u2019m not interested in books like fifty shades of grey ok i\\u2019m interested in the lifechanging magic of tidying up yes yes that\\u2019s right how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success that\\u2019s what your  is all about how can i turn this shit around i\\u2019m a horrible person i\\u2019m not happy with where i am how can i turn this shit around help me tony robbins help me\\ni have a hoarding problem which i\\u2019m hoping is the center of all of my other problems i\\u2019m hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictator\\u2019s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade \\u2019cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you\\u2019re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communists\\nthe last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit don\\u2019t ever do that with your mom it was like the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments \\u2026 manual the manual she don\\u2019t even know\\u2026 where the calculator is those of you under  probably don\\u2019t know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost like  and everybody thought it was like this judy jetson\\u2019s laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was like the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like \\u201cyou never know when you might need this\\u201d and i was like \\u201cbut\\u2026 i do know\\u2026 that i\\u2019m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die\\u201d \\u201cand i\\u2019m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah that\\u2019s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success\\u201d i grew up a lot this past year uh this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really i\\u2019m the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen they\\u2019re sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and uh he\\u2019s\\u2013 he\\u2019s much better looking than me he\\u2019s way out of my league and i saw him and i was like \\u201coh my god who is that\\u201d and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was like \\u201coh my god i\\u2019m gonna trap his ass\\u201d \\u201cgoing to trap his ass\\u201d and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was like \\u201call right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden\\u201d when really it\\u2019s a public park\\u2026 \\u2026that has hosted many reggae fests\\u2026 \\u2026and has even accidentally let\\u2026 two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing\\u2026 for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to\\u2026 it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had like we had\\u2026 we had so much chemistry he was like \\u201chey wassup\\u201d i was like \\u201cwassup\\u201d and we\\u2013 the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was like \\u201chey can you drop me off\\u201d i was like \\u201cwhere\\u201d he was like \\u201cat the park\\u201d and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was like \\u201coh no\\u201d \\u201ci just fucked a homeless dude again\\u201d my husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who like you know wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they like to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory it\\u2019s\\u2026 too much i don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with these bitches i get it you know because being with a white dude you feel very\\u2026 you feel very picturesque when you\\u2019re with a white dude you know you feel like you\\u2019re in a wes anderson movie or something and you know white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff like that and it\\u2019s very you know it\\u2019s hot hookin\\u2019 up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel like i\\u2019m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement\\u2026 \\u2026you know just right there through the money hole and just\\u2026 and then also he\\u2019s so vulnerable down there i\\u2019m like \\u201ci could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer\\u201d you know but i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home\\u2026 and be racist together you get to say whatever you like you don\\u2019t gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese i\\u2019m halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people it\\u2019s\\u2026 amazing it\\u2019s what love is built on you know my last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was like \\u201chold it you guys aren\\u2019t mexican\\u201d asianamerican men are very underrated i don\\u2019t know why people don\\u2019t go for them they\\u2019re the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down it\\u2019s like making love to a dolphin oh my god it\\u2019s so smooth just like a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night you know oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards it\\u2019s all red and inflamed and you\\u2019re like \\u201ci did not ask to be exfoliated today\\u201d \\u201cthis is the last time i go on jdate more like loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi\\u201d and then asian men no body odor none they just smell like responsibility that\\u2019s where the umami flavor comes from i think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding uh between each other because he\\u2019s halffilipino and halfjapanese and i\\u2019m halfchinese and halfvietnamese so we\\u2019re both halffancy asian\\u2026 \\u2026and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things like host olympics jungle asians host diseases it\\u2019s\\u2026 it\\u2019s different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse uh you know learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up like filipino carlton ok so he didn\\u2019t know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was like \\u201cit\\u2019s authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp\\u201d i was like \\u201cit\\u2019s not authentic ok\\u201d you can tell first and foremost by the name \\u2019cause it don\\u2019t got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused i grew up going to private school too him and i are both total like private school asians we both are big hippies too we like to backpack through southeast asia we like to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats that\\u2019s right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit like that uh we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes like freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread that\\u2019s like\\u2026 \\u2026a thousand percent of your daily fiber\\u2026 and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about\\u2026 \\u2026supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so it\\u2019s funny right because he\\u2019s asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do\\u2026 makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of asian people like we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall\\u2026 and neither of us know what the fuck they mean we\\u2019re like \\u201coh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house him and i had been dating for four years and i\\u2013 i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose\\u2026 because\\u2026 i had been pressuring him to do it so you know i just had this wacky women\\u2019s intuition that\\u2019s how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the man\\u2019s head first passively and then if he doesn\\u2019t get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because you know that you\\u2019re too old and it\\u2019s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so you\\u2019re like \\u201ci\\u2019m just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like \\u201cshut the fuck up fine will you marry me\\u201d and then afterwards the woman is always like \\u201coh my god he proposed\\u201d \\u201cit came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something\\u2026 that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day\\u201d let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page\\u2026 he\\u2019s probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday\\u2026 because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread that\\u2019s how rotten i was people are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband i\\u2019m a completely different person you\\u2013 like you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him i\\u2019m very soft and like very nurturing and very domestic we\\u2019ve been together now for five years and for five years i\\u2019ve packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that he\\u2019d become dependent on me \\u2018cause he graduated from harvard business school and i don\\u2019t wanna work anymore i don\\u2019t i straight up don\\u2019t wanna work anymore i don\\u2019t feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future \\u2018cause i don\\u2019t wanna work anymore i\\u2019ve been reading that book by sheryl sandberg she\\u2019s the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i don\\u2019t wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like \\u201cwe\\u2019re dumb women we don\\u2019t know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen\\u201d \\u201c\\u2018cause we\\u2019re too stupid to have any real responsibility\\u201d and then all these women had to show off and be like \\u201cwe could do it we could do anything\\u201d \\u201cbitch shut up\\u201d \\u201cdon\\u2019t tell them the secret\\u201d they ruined it for us and now we\\u2019re expected to work when i hear the phrase \\u201cdoubleincome household\\u201d i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and they\\u2019re like \\u201cbut ali we have so many more options now\\u201d oh you don\\u2019t think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it a lot of my friends when we walk around together they\\u2019ll get very judgmental about housewives that we\\u2019ll see on the street and they\\u2019ll be like \\u201clook at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants\\u201d i\\u2019m like \\u201cthat bitch is a genius\\u201d \\u201cshe\\u2019s not a housewife she\\u2019s retired\\u201d i do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is\\u2026 it\\u2019s a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers it\\u2019s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs it\\u2019s probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they don\\u2019t gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they don\\u2019t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they don\\u2019t gotta\\u2026 \\u2026ten times a day every day\\u2026 like you\\u2019re about to eat a sadass meal they don\\u2019t gotta do that they don\\u2019t gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that\\u2019s not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole it\\u2019s basically like wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired \\u2019cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed \\u2019cause you\\u2019re paranoid that your coworker\\u2019s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and you\\u2019re like \\u201coh no courtney\\u2019s listening she\\u2019s waiting she\\u2019s timing me\\u201d and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks like it\\u2019s been run over by the goonies housewives they don\\u2019t gotta muffle their shit too they don\\u2019t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they don\\u2019t gotta try to you know squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they don\\u2019t gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they want you know it\\u2019s\\u2013 it\\u2019s very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say \\u201cyou need to get to work on time\\u201d i was like \\u201cyou need to eat bananas\\u201d \\u201ci saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you don\\u2019t try to tell me to get my shit

i\\u2019m the real boss and i told you so motherfucker so do it sheryl sandberg that woman who wrote lean in has had such a big impact that now because of her there is a ban on the word \\u201cbossy\\u201d in elementary schools because according to her it\\u2019s sexist to use the word \\u201cbossy\\u201d because boys are never called bossy so now instead of saying \\u201cyou\\u2019re bossy\\u201d you\\u2019re supposed to say \\u201cyou have executive leadership skills\\u201d which is a very roundabout way of saying \\u201cyou\\u2019re a little cunt\\u201d i\\u2019m just waiting for the right moment to like become a housewife financially you know i want my husband to get us to like a certain point financially i wanna get to the point as a couple where i

brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteran so i don\\u2019t know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah it\\u2019s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics\\u2026 don\\u2019t get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you there\\u2019s\\u2013 none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear that\\u2019s not the case with male comics once they have a baby they\\u2019ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they\\u2019ll be like \\u201cguys i just had this fucking baby that baby\\u2019s a little piece of shit it\\u2019s so annoying and boring\\u201d and all these other shitty dads in the audience are like \\u201cthat\\u2019s hilarious i identify\\u201d and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper \\u2019cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby\\u2019s head shredding it up she\\u2019s busy so i don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s gonna happen to me you know a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were like \\u201cali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become\\u2013 you\\u2019re gonna disappear and you\\u2019re gonna become some lame stayathome mom\\u201d i was like \\u201cyeah that\\u2019s the dream\\u201d that\\u2019s the point this is the ultimate trap i won you know another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were like \\u201cwhy are you gonna have a kid why don\\u2019t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached\\u201d i was like \\u201cyeah that\\u2019s cool\\u2026 until my husband dies\\u201d which he\\u2019s definitely gonna before me because i\\u2019m a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until i\\u2019m a billion i\\u2019m guaranteed like a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase \\u201cblack don\\u2019t crack\\u201d well asian don\\u2019t die we don\\u2019t die especially the women we live forever and you know why we\\u2019re such bad drivers because we\\u2019re trying to die we\\u2019re like \\u201cyeah let me see how invincible i really am\\u201d \\u201cimma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely\\u201d \\u201ci\\u2019m gonna make a right turn\\u2013 i changed my mind it\\u2019s a uturn\\u201d \\u201ci changed my mind again it\\u2019s a oturn\\u201d every time i get into a car accident\\u2026 \\u2026i\\u2019m like \\u201coh my god not again\\u201d i need to hide my face so that everybody doesn\\u2019t see that it\\u2019s what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess there\\u2019s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood there\\u2019s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with me but i\\u2019m still here you know i need to have children to keep me company when i get older it\\u2019s lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis \\u2018cause she knows that she\\u2019s got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead i\\u2019m just kidding she doesn\\u2019t have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when i\\u2019m older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isn\\u2019t around to support me anymore i\\u2019m not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living that\\u2019s not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they don\\u2019t give a fuck they got no shame they\\u2019re like \\u201ci\\u2019m just gonna recycle\\u2026 go bald\\u2026 go to the park do this shit\\u201d they do that \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a free activity for them they do it in their\\u2013 their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see who\\u2019s gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are like the tupac and biggie of longevity i also decided to have a kid because uh i\\u2019m only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it\\u2013 and it scared me like i\\u2019m only  and\\u2026 \\u2026my pussy is not as wet as it used to be it\\u2019s very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just\\u2026 \\u201ci slime you i slime you ghostbusters\\u201d i don\\u2019t know what kind of mother i\\u2019m gonna be i\\u2019m\\u2013 i\\u2019m  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that\\u2026 is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b like skittles so my uterus probably looked like a smoker\\u2019s lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act like everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich \\u201cuh mmm\\u201d they watch property brothers scratch \\u201cwhat\\u2019s crackin\\u2019 mmm\\u201d every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is \\u201cwhen can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026smell my fingers\\u201d nature made you urgently curious to protect you \\u2019cause you gotta check that it\\u2019s all good in the hood if it\\u2019s too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmd when my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were like \\u201coh my god that\\u2019s so hot you guys doin\\u2019 a lot of fuckin\\u2019\\u201d no dude that\\u2019s\\u2013 that\\u2019s shit you do in your  ok when in\\u2013 when you\\u2019re in your  and you\\u2019ve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin\\u2019 it tells you when it\\u2019s easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was like only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be like \\u201cwe\\u2019re not fuckin\\u2019 i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out it\\u2019s like \\u2018release the kraken\\u201d and they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship you know and um\\u2026 yeah and most of the time like we wouldn\\u2019t even have sex \\u2019cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and i\\u2019d be like \\u201cok it\\u2019s go time\\u201d and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex it\\u2019s not because they\\u2019re in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex it\\u2019s because they\\u2019re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesn\\u2019t have to see the expression on my face that says \\u201cplease hurry the fuck up\\u201d and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish it\\u2019s when they get that\\u2026 that stupidass look on their face\\u2026 \\u2026where they look like they just got bit by a zombie just\\u2026 and then because we\\u2019re hippies i\\u2019d be like \\u201chey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok\\u201d and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him\\u2026 and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards\\u2026 to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me that\\u2019s right \\u2018cause i don\\u2019t wanna work anymore i\\u2019m very grateful to be pregnant and to be\\u2026 this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that they\\u2019re like \\u201coh my god that\\u2019s so dark and terrible i can\\u2019t believe that\\u201d i\\u2019m  girl when you\\u2019re  you\\u2019ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage it\\u2019s super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn\\u2019t feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom\\u2013 she\\u2019s from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was like \\u201cuh yeah where i\\u2019m from that\\u2019s like losing a pair of shoes it\\u2019s whatevs ok\\u201d and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me \\u201coh my god i see two sacks which means you\\u2019re having twins\\u201d and i was like \\u201cno\\u201d and then she said \\u201cbut what i don\\u2019t see is a heartbeat\\u201d and i was like \\u201cyes\\u201d \\u201cthe lord is mysterious\\u201d don\\u2019t feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds i\\u2019ve picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women won\\u2019t let their husbands watch when they\\u2019re going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was like \\u201cyou look\\u201d \\u201cyou watch the whole thing\\u201d and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyonc\\u00e9 he bought me a bike off of craigslist that\\u2019s my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wanted i\\u2019m scared about giving childbirth though i\\u2019m\\u2013 i\\u2019m very very scared of childbirth that\\u2019s why i\\u2019m going to hire a doula you know what that is you know what a doula is that\\u2019s a white hippie witch\\u2026 \\u2026that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser s\\u00f6ze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying \\u201cali did you know that you\\u2019re gonna poop on the table\\u201d i was like \\u201cyeah i look forward to it\\u201d i\\u2019m all backed up from holding in my shit at work i can\\u2019t wait to cleanse it makes sense like that you\\u2013 that that happens because when you\\u2019re in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think that\\u2019s enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay that\\u2019s the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasn\\u2019t even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house \\u201chey can you wash the dishes\\u201d \\u201cno\\u201d \\u201ccan you water the plants\\u201d \\u201ci am not doing jack shit anymore i\\u2019m busy makin\\u2019 a eyeball ok are you makin\\u2019 a foot i didn\\u2019t think so you change the channel\\u201d i can already see how there\\u2019s like this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor\\u2019s appointments with me \\u201coh my god i can\\u2019t believe he comes to all your doctor\\u2019s appointments he is so supportive\\u201d guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me i\\u2019m the star of the show there\\u2019s nothing for the camera to see if i\\u2019m not there but he\\u2019s the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant i\\u2019m a bad mommy you know i\\u2013 i\\u2013 i like i berate my husband on like a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me i\\u2019m fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis\\u2026 to keep him down so that he doesn\\u2019t believe that he\\u2019s worthy of another woman\\u2019s affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people don\\u2019t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant you know your nipples get huge and dark i didn\\u2019t know that i didn\\u2019t know that they get dark so that the baby can see like a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then you know they get big\\u2013 they get big like fingers like \\u201cyou you you owe me money you\\u201d my nipples look like whoppers now and naked i look like a minion but i\\u2019m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing it now that i\\u2019m seven and a half months pregnant my pussy\\u2019s all wet again but it\\u2019s different it\\u2019s not like when i was  years old when it was like really hot you know and i was like \\u201cwhy is it different\\u201d and i looked it up and my pussy\\u2019s all wet again because my\\u2013 my body\\u2019s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it that\\u2019s not the same when it\\u2019s straight up soldier glue when it\\u2019s neosporin so you know i\\u2013 i in\\u2013 previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy who\\u2019s like way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and uh two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out he\\u2019s the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enron\\u2019d my ass and now if i don\\u2019t work we die why else do you think i\\u2019m performing seven and a half months pregnant all right i\\u2019ve been ali wong have a good night everybody thank you your email address will not be published required

us we\\u2019re here this is crazy it\\u2019s insane so about five years ago pretty much everyone who i know started to get married and that was strange for me because i don\\u2019t really believe in the idea of marriage and that would have been fine except i have a problem where sometimes when i think that i am right about something it can be a real source of tension between me and the person i\\u2019m arguing with and the reason it\\u2019s a source of tension is that i\\u2019m right and so i remember distinctly talking to my friend dana and she goes \\u201cwell you don\\u2019t believe in marriage for you but of course you believe in it for other people\\u201d and i was like \\u201cno i think it\\u2019s insane you know for anyone\\u201d and she said \\u201cwhy\\u201d\\nand i said \\u201cwell first of all it just seems doomed\\u201d you know  of marriages end in divorce that\\u2019s just first marriages by the way second marriages  to  end in divorce third marriages  to  end in divorce that\\u2019s a learning curve\\nsecond of all monogamy\\u2019s impossible or at the very least not a sure thing when i say that i think people assume that i\\u2019m implying that men are incapable of being faithful i think women are just as incapable but for more sophisticated reasons you know i mean with men we\\u2019re just really simple we have a very simple sexuality when i say that my female friends are like \\u201cwell we like sex just as much as you do\\u201d and i said \\u201csure but it\\u2019s different\\u201d and they say \\u201chow\\u201d and i say \\u201chave you ever masturbated while driving a car\\u201d\\nnumber three\\u2026 i\\u2019m never gonna be happy why would anyone want to be a part of that i think that\\u2019s not brought up often enough i um i didn\\u2019t know that would be the reaction oh no that\\u2019s the hopeful part the uh\\u2026 i had one ally in all this which is my friend andy and he\\u2019s a comedian as well not only did we decide we weren\\u2019t gonna get married we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married yeah we were pretty good at it like we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages you know we were\\u2026 we were pretty good i mean we weren\\u2019t like the best in the world i\\u2019m sure there are better in europe but we were\\u2026 we were solid you know like so like for example at point my friend alex was about to get engaged and so we just took him to dinner and during dessert we gave him a long hard stare we said \\u201care you sure this is what you want to do\\u201d and then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we weren\\u2019t friends anymore so february   i\\u2019m at andy\\u2019s house in los angeles and earlier in the night i got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone and it was a bad one because i knew that i was right and andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation \\u2019cause he\\u2019s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether you\\u2019re right he says stuff like \\u201cshe sounds crazy\\u201d like even if what she\\u2019s saying isn\\u2019t that crazy like you\\u2019d be like \\u201cshe only eats whole wheat bagels\\u201d he\\u2019d be like \\u201cshe sounds crazy\\u201d you\\u2019d be like \\u201cthat\\u2019s not even the crazy part\\u201d you know so i\\u2019m telling him about his argument and he goes \\u201cyou\\u2019re right\\u201d i go \\u201ci know i\\u2019m right\\u201d he goes \\u201cyeah you\\u2019re right\\u201d i go \\u201ci know i\\u2019m right i got to tell her about this in the morning\\u201d and i get in my rental car to head back to my hotel and i\\u2019m driving out of andy\\u2019s small road and i\\u2019m tboned i don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019re familiar with this term uh\\u2026 this is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driver\\u2019s side at a  angle like a tbone steak and in   seconds i\\u2019m spun around and i think i\\u2019m dead no wait i\\u2019m paralyzed and then i hear nothing and then i hear the other car skid out and drive away i know let me tell you how this argument started i met jenny in st louis my friend andy and i were working for her company they were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches which is really my demographic i uh\\u2026 no i was very nervous about this i was actually kind of about to go onstage and i was like scrawling notes on my napkin a lot of times i\\u2019ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary and jenny looked at me and she goes \\u201cwhat are you doing\\u201d and i said \\u201ci\\u2019m writing my set list\\u201d and then she goes \\u201ci think it\\u2019ll be fine\\u201d and i was like \\u201cno it won\\u2019t be fine\\u201d and then she was like \\u201ci think it will be okay\\u201d and i said \\u201cwhy do you think that\\u201d and she said \\u201cwell you look so nervous i think they\\u2019ll feel sorry for you\\u201d but jenny has this really soft sweet voice like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything at one point she said \\u201cit seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage\\u201d normally i\\u2019d be offended by that but in this instance i was like \\u201cyou are right that is a great point you are beautiful you know\\u201d she re\\u2026 she really was you know from the moment i met jenny i knew i wanted to sleep with her at least once stay with me uh i mean\\u2026 i mean that in like in the most meaningful way like that was the most that i was capable of in my life at that point i\\u2026 i\\u2019d jus\\u2026 i\\u2019d just come off a really long difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married and\\u2026 and then we weren\\u2019t and then when we weren\\u2019t i was so heartbroken i just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely you know and\\u2026 but from the moment i met jenny i just wanted to be with her and i didn\\u2019t\\u2026 i didn\\u2019t think it was gonna happen like i don\\u2019t have that kind of confidence i actually think of myself as a sex maybe which is to say that if i\\u2019m seeing a girl she\\u2019d think \\u201ci\\u2019d have sex with him maybe\\u201d you know and i\\u2019m\\u2026 i\\u2019m not ashamed of that there were periods in my life where i was a sex never or a sex with self always yeah and often surprisingly often yeah i just don\\u2019t give off a great first impression like i\\u2019ll give you an example like this is the shirt i decided to wear tonight like i didn\\u2019t\\u2026 i didn\\u2019t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt i mean this is my \\u201ca\\u201d outfit my \\u201cb\\u201d outfit was naked i like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that i might be a fixerupper i\\u2019ve reached this point in my life i don\\u2019t really look in the mirror before i leave my apartment i glance at it to make sure i\\u2019m not bleeding you know what i mean like\\u2026 but i don\\u2019t stare at the mirror if i stare at the mirror i get angry like i feel like i\\u2019m complaining about a bad call a ref just made i\\u2019m like \\u201ccome on\\u201d \\u201cyou\\u2019re blind if you\\u2019re leaving the house like that\\u201d and the ref is god and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline and it\\u2019s a close game \\u2019cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast and i\\u2019m all riled up i\\u2019m about to charge the field and the guy comes by with fried dough and i\\u2019m like \\u201cnext time\\u201d you know that\\u2019s how i go for fried dough \\u2019cause i have a problem i just\\u2026 this is ridiculous can you follow me over here for a second i\\u2019m gonna jump off stage this is only in seattle where someone is wearing no shoes no shoes or socks what who are you people what is wrong with you i would expect that behavior from this guy but not you sir not you what is this where do you think you are from seattle yeah seattle so i\\u2019ve been going uh recently to a women\\u2019s exercise class ii\\u2019ve given up on having a traditional male physique and so now i\\u2019m going for strong independent woman and uh\\u2026 it\\u2019s going pretty well you know i\\u2019m not as good in the class as you might think sometimes i\\u2019ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isn\\u2019t looking but then when she looks over i always have to strike a pose as though i\\u2019ve been doing what everybody else has been doing it reminds me of the olympics you know how they do gymnastics how they\\u2019ll have those\\u2026 the girls will do those crazy flips and twirls and every once in a while\\u2026 and i\\u2019m not saying i root for this to happen but sometimes they\\u2019ll fall and it\\u2019s ugly \\u2019cause they\\u2019re rolling around like \\u201ci\\u2019m in a lot of trouble like i don\\u2019t even know how i got here\\u201d but at the end of that no matter what\\u2026 and i totally fall for it i\\u2019m like \\u201cthat can\\u2019t possibly be the same loser \\u201cfrom moments ago \\u201ci mean that\\u2019s a completely different person \\u201cthis person has much better posture for starters\\u201d i really wanted jenny to come out with me and andy that night in st louis \\u2019cause we were going out to one of these famous irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak and so i thought that might work to my advantage i don\\u2019t know and uh\\u2026 i didn\\u2019t have the nerve to ask her myself and so i convinced andy to ask her for us and uh\\u2026 pfft which\\u2026 yeah i don\\u2019t know if that was the best idea \\u2019cause uh we\\u2019re heading\\u2026 we\\u2019re in the car heading to the pub and jenny says \\u201coh i left my id at the hotel\\u201d and i was like \\u201coh we can just swing back and get it\\u201d and she\\u2019s like\\u2026 she\\u2019s like \\u201cno it\\u2019ll be fine\\u201d i was like \\u201cno it won\\u2019t be fine \\u2019cause it\\u2019s st patrick\\u2019s day and there\\u2019s bouncers\\u201d and she goes \\u201cno it\\u2019ll be okay\\u201d and i was like \\u201cno it won\\u2019t be okay\\u201d and then we get to the pub and it was fine like the bouncer just kind of waved her through which has not been my experience with bouncers for me bouncers are like prison guards and for jenny they\\u2019re like birthday clowns like you know \\u201cwhat can i do to make your day better\\u201d\\nyou know and that\\u2019s\\u2026 we\\u2019re at the pub and it had taken so much convincing for andy to get jenny to come out there by the time she came out she thought she was on a date with him and yeah that wasn\\u2019t the idea and so i said\\u2026 i had to convince him to fall away as the night went on like the red rockets on the space shuttle and eventually she realized she was on a date with me and she was not happy about that but uh\\u2026 but she warmed to me as the night went on \\u2019cause she was drinking and then like\\u2026 no by the end of the night we were laughing and having a good time and we\\u2026 i caught a break which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends and she and i were stuffed in this little back seat together and it was really quiet so i could hear her soft voice and she told me she had just come off a long difficult breakup and i told her about my breakup and for a moment there in the back seat it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart and\\u2026 we get back to the hotel and i offer to walk her to her room and she says \\u201csure\\u201d we get to her door and i didn\\u2019t want this night to end and so i build up the courage to lean in to kiss her and she says \\u201coh no thank you\\u201d which i thought was polite\\u2026 but disappointing i mean there\\u2019s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because you\\u2019re really putting yourself out there you\\u2019re just like \\u201ci think we should connect mouths\\u201d you know and\\u2026 the other person\\u2019s like \\u201ci do not think we should connect mouths\\u201d and those are\\u2026 they\\u2019re two very different mouth agendas you know and then you just feel so stupid you\\u2019re like \\u201ci never should have suggested we connect mouths you know\\u201d this is a sore subject for me i have sort of a long history of failed kisses like i\\u2026 i remember growing up like when people started making out like in my time in massachusetts it was in seventh grade i remember\\u2026 i remember it like it was yesterday \\u2019cause i was shocked i was like \\u201cpeople we know are just making out with other people we know\\u201d \\u201cbut how\\u201d you know it seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden i was like \\u201ci am not doing that\\u201d and collectively all the girls in my class were like \\u201cthat is fine \\u201cyou are not on the list \\u201cyou\\u2019re not exactly a firstround draft pick for our new activity\\u201d i was like \\u201cperfect\\u201d it seemed so gross to me and it still does kind of like sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like \\u201ci don\\u2019t like when i see two dudes making out in the street\\u201d and i feel that way about anyone like making out is just sloppy it\\u2019s like watching a dog eat spaghetti that\\u2019s how i make out is that right does anybody know if that\\u2019s right okay good so\\u2026 in seventh grade i was like \\u201ci\\u2019m not gonna make out with anybody\\u201d and that was fine for a while but increasingly it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts it was like the makeout club and the nonmakeout club and these were informal organizations of course i mean i would be sad if that were schoolsanctioned like \\u201cwe call this meeting of the nonmakeout club to order \\u201cfirst order of business nintendo \\u201csecond order of business why doesn\\u2019t anyone like us meeting adjourned\\u201d i don\\u2019t know it was a sad group and we were losing good guys by the day i feared\\u2026 i feared that soon i would be the lone member of the nonmakeout club so i was like \\u201ci got to try to get into the makeout club\\u201d but it was a very intangible goal i didn\\u2019t really talk to a lot of girls and\\u2026 there was one girl who sat in front of me in class named lisa bazetti who i had a huge crush on but she was way out of my league like she had many suitors she had\\u2026 i don\\u2019t\\u2026 the rest of the show is in old english uh\\u2026 she doth had many suitors uh no she had many you know admirers and there were three of us really and i was in third place in all the trade publications but i had one advantage over these other guys which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework thanks to alphabetical order bazetti birbiglia one time i said something on the phone that made her laugh and i was like \\u201coh this is great i got to do that more\\u201d and one time we were on the phone and she was laughing so hard i remember so well \\u2019cause she goes \\u201cmike you got to stop i\\u2019m gonna pee myself\\u201d and i was like \\u201cwow\\u201d this was the closest i\\u2019d ever come to a vagina so spent the next  years trying to get lisa bazetti to pee and that\\u2019s how i ended up here yeah that\\u2019s how we all ended up here in a sense so\\u2026 uh\\u2026 so here\\u2019s what happened with lisa one time i built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me and she said yes i couldn\\u2019t believe it like all of a sudden i thought \\u201cwell maybe this will be like \\u201cone of those romantic comedy montages \\u201cwe\\u2019ll go to the carnival we\\u2019ll get stuck \\u201con the top of the ferris wheel we\\u2019ll make out \\u201cit\\u2019ll all take a minute and a half and it will be set to phil collins song\\u201d but i think that when you\\u2019re  years old you just don\\u2019t understand certain things about your digestive system you don\\u2019t know that you shouldn\\u2019t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler cotton candy being the most insane of these items it\\u2019s basically saying \\u201cwe\\u2019re gonna take sugar \\u201cwhich everyone knows is bad but then we\\u2019ll dress it up like insulation\\u201d and i\\u2019m like \\u201ci\\u2019m not sure \\u201cwhat the selling point is there is it the sugar or the insulation\\u201d they\\u2019re like \\u201cwe already sold it\\u201d i\\u2019m like \\u201cwell done way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates\\u201d i don\\u2019t know if you have the scrambler here in seattle i imagine you might it travels on a truck it is a very mobile scrambling unit the premise is very simple you just sit on a twoperson pod with the person you are in love with and that pod goes in a circle which is part of a larger circle which is part of an even grander circle as i understand it it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients it was called the \\u201cshits of pantserator\\u201d and it was wildly successful and then it was coopted by the carnival workers of america cwoa and they said\\u2026 they said \\u201cwe like it but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff\\u201d and then one guy says \\u201cwell what about the \\u2018i think i\\u2019m gonna dieerator\\u2019\\u201d and they\\u2019re like \\u201cthat\\u2019s good \\u201c\\u2019cause it gets across the essence of how you feel \\u201cwhen you\\u2019re on the machine \\u201cplus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea \\u201cwhich is a nice homage \\u201cto the original intention of the machine \\u201cbut we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff\\u201d and then one guy goes \\u201cwell what about the scrambler \\u2018cause it scrambles you\\u201d they\\u2019re like \\u201cwe get it frank but who\\u2026\\u201d frank is a maniac this guy can\\u2019t be stopped but every once in a while he\\u2019s got a good idea \\u201cbut who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment\\u201d and this one guy goes \\u201cwell i have a nephew who\\u2019s  years old \\u201cand smokes pot  hours a day i feel like he might be available\\u201d and they\\u2019re like \\u201che sounds amazing \\u201cwe don\\u2019t even need to interview him he sounds completely qualified\\u201d\\ni sit down with lisa on the scrambler and i\\u2019m feeling good like she\\u2019s snuggling up close to me and i\\u2019m thinking\\u2026 i\\u2019m thinking like \\u201cthis could be it \\u201cthis could be where it\\u2019s all gonna happen this is very special\\u201d and then they put that bar seat belt down and the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment it\\u2019s not a ralph nader approved item i don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s saved lives i think the only thing it\\u2019s ever done is in a scrambler accident it\\u2019s just sort of held someone\\u2019s esophagus down to the pavement making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident first rule of scrambler accident don\\u2019t talk about scrambler accident that\\u2019s from scrambler club well i knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that i was going to throw up for sure and i even said to the  stoner i was like \\u201chey actually\\u2026\\u201d and then he was gone apparently he doesn\\u2019t enjoy the second halves of sentences\\nso then i\\u2019m scrambling and\\u2026 as i am scrambling i\\u2019m thinking \\u201ci need to come up with a plan of some kind i\\u2019m not going down without a fight\\u201d my first plan was very simple it was just don\\u2019t look at lisa don\\u2019t look at any other people i was like \\u201cdon\\u2019t look at lisa \\u201cdon\\u2019t look at any other people \\u201cdon\\u2019t look at lisa \\u201cdon\\u2019t look at any other people i need a new plan\\u201d and\\u2026 the new plan was i needed to tell the scrambler operator\\u2026 that he needed to stop the ride but\\u2026 the mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window so i\\u2019m like \\u201ci got to tell him he\\u2019s got to stop the ride \\u201ci got to tell him he\\u2019s got to stop the ride \\u201ci got to tell him he\\u2019s got to stop the ride please stop the ride\\u201d and i\\u2019m back \\u201ci\\u2019m not sure he heard me \\u201ci got to say it louder please stop the ride \\u201ci\\u2019m not sure he\\u2019s paying attention i think he might be smoking pot right now\\u201d the third time i said \\u201cplease stop\\u201d and then i started throwing up and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler just\\u2026 popcorn peanuts\\u2026 insulation really insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa i did not look at lisa but i\\u2019m pretty sure she was staring at me because i was a spectacle at that point i was spectacular and we did not make out i did not lose my mouth virginity that evening two years later it gets worse um\\u2026 i\\u2019m at the st john\\u2019s high school what they call a cattle call dance this is an all boys catholic school i attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty st john\\u2019s gymnasium like cattle which is a friendly way to describe women you know so\\u2026 cattle shows up at  we\\u2019ll make out with the cattle cattle goes home at  then we go out for burgers completely separate from the cattle analogy it was a horrible affair it was just like this room chockfull of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out at this point i was indeed the lone member of the nonmakeout club but it was actually worse than that \\u2019cause i had to lie to my friends and tell them i had had my first kiss \\u2019cause it was like this really tough all boys school and so when they would ask like \\u201coh have you had your first kiss\\u201d i\\u2019d be like \\u201cyeah like all the time like every\\u2026 every week\\u201d i always feared at some point there\\u2019d be a followup question like \\u201coh yeah what\\u2019s it like\\u201d and i\\u2019d be like \\u201cyeah you know it\\u2019s just like licking an ice cream cone\\u201d and they\\u2019d be like \\u201cno it\\u2019s not it\\u2019s like sucking on a rocket pop\\u201d and i\\u2019d be like \\u201cah wrong frozen dessert analogy\\u201d i\\u2019m at the dance and i\\u2019m flanked by my friend sam ricciardi and we\\u2019re introduced by our friend tom to these girls from his town they were the last two cows at the dance they were like \\u201cmoo\\u201d and we were like \\u201cmoo\\u201d and then sam says one of these phrases i think we\\u2019ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat he says \\u201cyou get that one\\u201d which i know it\\u2019s the worst turn of phrase but i\\u2019m comfortable saying it \\u2019cause i know i\\u2019ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me \\u201cyou get that one\\u201d and then her friend goes like \\u201coof\\u201d you know or even worse\\u2026 or even worse like \\u201cyou owe me\\u201d which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance i would hate to hurt someone\\u2019s credit score you know so he goes\\u2026 he goes \\u201cyou get that one\\u201d and then i\\u2019m just fast dancing with this girl sandra to young mc\\u2019s bust a move and i\\u2019m not great at fast dancing but they had the strobe light going so it\\u2019s only catching me one out of every five\\u2026 hey so she\\u2019s losing interest but at  the speed and then i\\u2019m saved by a slow song stairway to heaven which is a classic makeout anthem led zeppelin eight minutes long what\\u2019s great about slow dancing is you can\\u2019t really mess it up \\u2019cause it\\u2019s just sort of a slowmotion hug like the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it she\\u2019d be like \\u201cwhat are you doing\\u201d and i\\u2019d be like \\u201ci don\\u2019t pick up on social cues\\u201d you know but it\\u2019s such a long song you know stairway so i\\u2019m just trying not to fidget i\\u2019m sort of a fidgety person i feared if i fidgeted too much i might initiate the head tilt too early i didn\\u2019t know anything about making out but i\\u2019d seen people do it i could see there\\u2019s like a head tilt i had heard there were tongues involved and i could see that there was like some kind of space in between the two mouths to me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing what is happening in that space there is no\\u2026 you know there\\u2019s no video documentation of that area it\\u2019s like the giant squid of making out no one has seen it alive they\\u2019ve only seen it washed up on the shore\\u2026 which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy but\\u2026 so i\\u2019m trying not to fidget then with   minutes left in stairway to heaven the song hits that crescendo\\u2026 all around me kids start to make the tilt just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me and i was like \\u201coh no i don\\u2019t want to be alone anymore\\u201d and i make the slightest tilt and then sandra comes in strong and then it\\u2019s an allout mouth war and she had artillery \\u2019cause she had braces it was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork as this oral atrocity is taking place all i can think is \\u201ci\\u2019m not alone anymore i\\u2019m not in the nonmakeout club\\u201d and all i wanted to do was tell my friends but i couldn\\u2019t because up until that point i\\u2019d lied and said that i\\u2019d had my first kiss i walked off the dance floor sam was like \\u201chow\\u2019d it go dude\\u201d i had to be like \\u201csame as always pretty smooth\\u201d as the week wore on i started to convince myself \\u201cwell maybe it did go well \\u201cand i should call sandra and this could bud into a relationship of some kind\\u201d but\\u2026 i got her number from tom and those conversations ended up being very brief you know we didn\\u2019t have a lot to talk about i remember just being like \\u201chey you like full house \\u201cme neither cool all right later\\u201d you know what i mean at certain points i remember getting this vibe from her kind of like \\u201cwhy are you calling me\\u201d and i remember thinking \\u201coh i\\u2019m probably reading into that one too much\\u201d and\\u2026 and then she stopped calling me back and i was like \\u201coh yeah i read into that one perfectly\\u201d but i just felt so dumb about the whole thing and the worst part is i couldn\\u2019t even tell my friends until one day i was\\u2026 i was standing by my locker with my friend tom and so i said to him i was like \\u201chey what\\u2019s going on with sandra like she hasn\\u2019t called me back\\u201d and tom has this knowing grin on his face i was like \\u201cwhat\\u201d tom was like \\u201cnothing\\u201d and i was like \\u201cwhat\\u201d tom was like \\u201cnothing\\u201d and i was like \\u201cwhat\\u201d tom\\u2019s like \\u201coh\\u201d \\u201ci talked to sandra and she said \\u201cyou\\u2019re the worst kisser she\\u2019s ever kissed\\u201d and it was so devastating \\u2019cause not only was it probably true but i couldn\\u2019t explain to my friends why it was true i couldn\\u2019t say \\u201cthat makes sense i\\u2019ve never done that before\\u201d so instead i had to play it off i had to be like \\u201cyeah that sounds about right \\u201ci\\u2019m a terrible kisser that\\u2019s kind of my thing\\u201d so i lean in to kiss jenny and she says \\u201coh no thank you\\u201d she agrees to go out with me in new york we were both living in new york and she gave me her number and i typed it in my phone and from that point on she would be \\u201cjen irish pub nice\\u201d a few weeks later i took her out to a restaurant i couldn\\u2019t afford to show her how much money i could put on my credit card we\\u2019re out to dinner and she says to me she goes \\u201ceveryone hates me at work\\u201d and i said \\u201cwhy would they hate you i love you\\u201d she goes \\u201cyou love me\\u201d i go \\u201ci mean you seem cool\\u201d i pulled it back i didn\\u2019t want to show all my cards just about nine of them one of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said \\u201cyou know sometimes i\\u2019ll date two people at once and that way i\\u2019m never let down by either person\\u201d i said \\u201cthat seems like a really smart plan like i\\u2019d like to do that as well\\u201d and she said \\u201ci\\u2019m still kind of seeing my exboyfriend john and you can see other people too but you have to tell me if you\\u2019re seeing them\\u201d and i was like \\u201call right sounds like a plan \\u201cgot it break i got to go find some more people you know\\u201d and so a few nights later i\\u2019m in another city and i do a show and after the show i went out to a bar and i ended up making out with this random girl then a few nights later i\\u2019m out to dinner with jenny and she says \\u201chow was your trip\\u201d and i said \\u201cit was great i did some shows \\u201cand then one night i ended up making out with this random girl\\u201d and that didn\\u2019t go over very well in the conversation i could sense that something was wrong and i was like \\u201cbut i\\u2019m right about that right like i\\u2019m supposed to tell you if that happens right\\u201d and she says \\u201cyeah but it doesn\\u2019t mean \\u201cthat i won\\u2019t lose interest in you\\u201d and i said \\u201cthat\\u2019s a whole new clause \\u201cthat\\u2019s a twist what is this the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects\\u201d i said \\u201care you still seeing john\\u201d and she said \\u201csometimes\\u201d i said \\u201cwell don\\u2019t you see the contradiction in that\\u201d and she says \\u201cyes\\u201d and it gets very quiet\\u2026 because we were falling in love three weeks into my relationship with jenny i built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to bermuda i wanted to show her how much more money i could put on my credit card since i didn\\u2019t have a lot left we went to bermuda \\u2019cause it was the off season you can get these great deals online because as it turns out when it\\u2019s winter in new york it is also winter\\u2026 in bermuda and uh\\u2026 jenny and i meet up at the airport and she\\u2019s late which is a big pet peeve of mine i fancy myself as a professional traveler i\\u2019m always two hours early i have my pocket for my ticket and my passport and i have laceless moccasins i never tell jokes about bombs and\\u2026 and jenny\\u2019s late and then we get to security and i\\u2019m not making this up she doesn\\u2019t have a license or a passport and i said \\u201cwhat do you mean\\u201d i go \\u201chow do you travel\\u201d and she goes \\u201cwell \\u201cusually they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work id\\u201d i don\\u2019t like to dwell on the differences between men and women but i just can\\u2019t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport and they would let him on the plane but women get a pass on things like this that i find completely bewildering i mean if i were in charge of alqaeda for example what\\u2026 what i would do is i would recruit attractive women because they\\u2019re just not stopped under any circumstances although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the  virgins and you know the women wouldn\\u2019t want that unless they\\u2019re lesbians although there\\u2019s an idea you know alqaeda\\u2026 alqaeda could recruit hot lesbians although\\u2026 then they\\u2019d have to guarantee that the  virgins are also lesbians i mean what are the odds you know all  virgins are also lesbians unless you think of sexuality as like a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity like the  virgins are like \\u201ci didn\\u2019t even know i was a lesbian \\u201cuntil i had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist \\u201cand now that\\u2019s all i\\u2019m into \\u201ci used to be into these afghani guys who are so crazy \\u201cthey\\u2019d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me \\u201cand  of my friends but now i don\\u2019t see khalid in the same way anymore\\u201d the point is we went to bermuda and we\\u2019re on the flight\\u2026 on the flight and the flight attendant comes over and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us and she says \\u201ccongratulations on your honeymoon\\u201d and we said \\u201coh no thanks we\\u2019re not on our honeymoon\\u201d and she walks away and jenny says \\u201cthat\\u2019s so funny i don\\u2019t think i\\u2019ll ever go on a honeymoon\\u201d and i said \\u201coh really\\u201d and she goes \\u201cyeah i don\\u2019t think i\\u2019d ever want to get married in my life\\u201d and i said \\u201coh really\\u201d i go \\u201cme too\\u201d i said \\u201cis that based on a principle \\u201cor did you have a bad relationship like what was your first boyfriend like\\u201d and\\u2026 she told me about her first boyfriend brian it was\\u2026 they were at the same bus stop when they were  and they would make out on the bus and they were together for six years and they\\u2026 you know their relationship got deeper and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together and i said \\u201cthen what\\u201d and she said \\u201che died he had leukemia\\u201d and i said \\u201cwell do you ever talk about this with anyone\\u201d and she says \\u201cno i don\\u2019t really like to talk about it\\u201d but these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where jenny was opening up to me and i was opening up to her and every night we\\u2019d be up till  or  in the morning and we were so happy we\\u2026 at one point i was like \\u201cwell we should do this again \\u201cwe should go on another trip and you could get a license or a passport\\u201d jenny said \\u201cthat sounds great \\u201cbut i don\\u2019t think i\\u2019d get a license or a passport \\u2019cause they don\\u2019t make me get one\\u201d and i was like \\u201cyeah but it\\u2019s the law\\u201d you know jenny says \\u201cyeah i don\\u2019t think i\\u2019ll get one \\u201c\\u2019cause they don\\u2019t make me get one you know that\\u2019s how i feel\\u201d that\\u2019s how jenny argues things sometimes she\\u2019ll just say \\u201cthat\\u2019s how i feel\\u201d and i\\u2019ll say \\u201cthat\\u2019s not an argument\\u201d \\u201clike we\\u2019re not even in an argument right now because you don\\u2019t have an argument\\u201d and she\\u2019ll say \\u201ci just won that argument\\u201d and i\\u2019ll say \\u201cthat\\u2019s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is\\u201d and she\\u2019ll say \\u201ci just won that argument\\u201d again \\u201cthat\\u2019s how i feel\\u201d you could see how this could be a little bit maddening you know uh\\u2026 on our final day on the trip we got into an argument about essentially nothing she noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel and she said \\u201cwe should play\\u201d and i was like \\u201cyeah but not like a game\\u201d and she said \\u201cwhy\\u201d and i said \\u201cwell \\u2019cause i\\u2019d win\\u201d and she said \\u201cno i think i would win\\u201d i go \\u201cno i know that i\\u2019d win \\u201cand i know that what i\\u2019m supposed to say is that\\u2026 \\u201cthe guy says \\u2018i\\u2019ll win\\u2019 the girl says \\u2018i\\u2019ll win\\u2019 \\u201cand the guy lets her win and then she likes him more but i just don\\u2019t have that in me\\u201d and jenny goes \\u201cyou don\\u2019t have to let me win let\\u2019s go out and play\\u201d and so we went out and played basketball and i just kicked her ass i mean it was just like\\u2026 it was just like\\u2026  to  you know  to  i mean i was having a good day but still i was just destroying her and at one point she literally said \\u201ci\\u2019ve never met someone who\\u2019s so obsessed with the score\\u201d and i said \\u201cthe score is what makes it a game\\u201d so we\\u2019re arguing this over lunch and then again it comes up at dinner and then we\\u2019re still arguing about it at  or  in the morning about essentially nothing and she said \\u201ci don\\u2019t understand why you\\u2019re so obsessed with being right\\u201d i go \\u201ci\\u2019m not obsessed with it i just am\\u201d i said \\u201cwhy do you think you\\u2019re right\\u201d and she says \\u201cthat\\u2019s how i feel\\u201d i said \\u201cif you think i\\u2019m so wrong about everything why are you even with me\\u201d and jenny says \\u201cyou can\\u2019t choose who you love\\u201d which is true but it doesn\\u2019t mean it\\u2019s good i remember the first time i fell in love i was in high school and it was that first time where you fall in love and you\\u2019re just like \\u201cthis is it i found her i\\u2019m  years old and i\\u2019m done you know\\u201d and\\u2026 her name was amanda and she was like adorable and funny and what was really exciting for me was that she was like a delinquent like i was like this playbytherules school citizen and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid which i thought was a really strong quality like at one point she was like \\u201cit was totally messed up because it wasn\\u2019t even me it was this other girl and i was framed\\u201d and i was just like \\u201cawesome\\u201d like no one would ever frame me for anything i just\\u2026 i thought it was like an opposites attract situation she wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper and i wanted to know what it was like to be cool at one point i was like \\u201cdo you want to write an article for the newspaper\\u201d she goes \\u201ci don\\u2019t want to write an article i want to do things people write articles about\\u201d and i was like \\u201cgood answer\\u201d\\ni find that when you fall in love you tend to overlook certain red flags one of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me but then she would pull it back she\\u2019d be like \\u201cno one likes you at all only kidding\\u201d or like \\u201cyou\\u2019re like a nerd but you\\u2019re not even smart just joking\\u201d can\\u2019t choose who you love\\nsecond red flag with amanda was that she was a liar and i don\\u2019t\\u2026 i don\\u2019t mean that in an offensive way like lying was kind of like a\\u2026 it\\u2019s like a sport at the school i was at i transferred from the all boys school to this coed school there was this one guy in my class named keith robbins who was a legendary liar you\\u2019d know when he was lying \\u2019cause he would lick his finger like a bookie and he would dart his eyes from side to side and he\\u2019d go \\u201cyeah yeah nice nice you know\\u201d and he wasn\\u2019t even handling money like i don\\u2019t even know what this is about and then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant he\\u2019d be like \\u201cyeah my uncle\\u2019s tony robbins \\u201cmotivational speaker yeah nice you know\\u201d and\\u2026 we found out that that wasn\\u2019t even true but even if that were true that wouldn\\u2019t be impressive to a bunch of high school students but i think that\\u2019s the jedi level of lying is you lie about little stuff and no one notices when you\\u2019re lying about big stuff it\\u2019s like banking\\nthe final red flag with amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend i know i\\u2019m in the future also i think we can all see now \\u2019cause we\\u2019re so smart and mike\\u2019s so dumb and uh\\u2026 you know i can also see in retrospect that\\u2019s a much bigger red flag than i perceived it to be at the time but i was so excited she was even with me at all and she said she had another boyfriend at home but they were in the process of breaking up but it was a bad time \\u2019cause his parents were sick and so i tried to be understanding of that you know i went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents and i thought \\u201cwell this is the affirmation that i need i\\u2019m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend\\u201d and i drive my mom\\u2019s station wagon to amanda\\u2019s parents\\u2019 house and i walk in the front door and there\\u2019s amanda and there\\u2019s her parents and it\\u2019s going well and a few hours go by and this other guy comes over to the house and his name is scott i\\u2019m assuming he\\u2019s like a family friend or a relative and slowly i\\u2019m noticing similarities between scott and things that amanda has said about her other boyfriend they\\u2019re both in their first year in college and they\\u2019re competitive wrestlers and\\u2026 it\\u2019s dawning on me that i\\u2019m hanging out with my girlfriend\\u2019s boyfriend and it\\u2019s going pretty well i mean he\\u2026 he seemed like a nice guy i could totally see what she saw in him there was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom she would hold on to my hand and she would say \\u201ci wish it were just you and me here\\u201d and i remember thinking \\u201cyou could make that happen\\u201d the way she said it was as though she weren\\u2019t involved in the decision process like \\u201ci\\u2019d love to but the boys in corporate\\u2026\\u201d\\nwell the day took an even stranger turn when scott suggested that we go hang out at his house and i met his parents it is indescribable meeting your girlfriend\\u2019s boyfriend\\u2019s parents for the first time part of you is angry for obvious reasons but then part of you still wants to make a good impression you know you\\u2019re like\\u2026 \\u201cmaybe if this goes well she\\u2019ll see that i\\u2019m good with adults in general\\u201d as a side note his parents seemed in perfect health at one point his dad even said to me \\u201chow do you know amanda\\u201d and i said \\u201cwe\\u2019re just friends from school\\u201d and i was so ashamed and i felt so dumb and i drove home and i remember thinking \\u201ci am never gonna let this happen to me again\\u201d so\\u2026 ten months into my relationship with jenny she invites me to meet her parents and this was a tricky time at this point our relationship was intense but casual which is a dangerous relationship cocktail and it was a hard thing to organize \\u2019cause i was away probably five days out of the week and so we found a sunday where i was coming back from a fiveday stint in texas which was awful \\u2019cause it was\\u2026 in texas and i\\u2026 that\\u2019s\\u2026 that\\u2019s not to say i dislike texas entirely it\\u2019s such a large thing to dislike and uh\\u2026 but that week it felt like texas just disliked me and i just kind of disliked texas back to the point where i developed a small drinking problem which is\\u2026 which is very popular in texas i was performing at a comedy club now comedy\\u2026 i love comedy clubs \\u2019cause they\\u2019re sort of a highlow entertainment proposition like in some ways though they\\u2019re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word and then some of them sell dildo straws you know like there\\u2019s  bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends and they\\u2019re handing out gummy penises or whatever that\\u2019s\\u2026 that\\u2019s actually a thing i didn\\u2019t even realize that\\u2026 i didn\\u2019t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was\\u2026 was the gummy quality of the penis i feel like if i were in charge of the candification of the penis it would be hard candy and then if\\u2026 and then if you suck it down to the gummy part then you just sort of put that off to the side but i\\u2026 but that\\u2019s\\u2026 that\\u2019s not my job i\\u2019m\\u2026 you know i leave that to the experts but i just\\u2026 i just do the comedy part but i was performing at this club all week and after the late show saturday night i was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things and\\u2026 i\\u2019d been drinking all week and uh i always try to be a team player you know so i was like \\u201cwhatever i can do to help i don\\u2019t see how this could end badly\\u201d and uh\\u2026 the next morning i wake up in the my hotel room and i\\u2019m hung over and i\\u2019m groggy and i roll out of bed and i run to the airport to catch my flight i\\u2019m still two hours early and\\u2026 i land in new york and i get a cab to jenny\\u2019s parents\\u2019 house and i walk in the front door and there\\u2019s jenny and there\\u2019s her parents and there\\u2019s her other sort of exboyfriend john and he wasn\\u2019t front and center like he was just kind of around like he was in the pool like wading and doing laps like that kind of thing but i pulled jenny aside i was like \\u201cwell what\\u2019s john doing here\\u201d and she says \\u201cwell he and i aren\\u2019t still together \\u201cbut when we were together \\u201che became friends with my stepdad \\u201cand he\\u2019s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks\\u201d and i said \\u201cyou know that\\u2019s not good i feel like that gives him the edge\\u201d jenny\\u2019s staring at me and i said \\u201cwhat\\u201d she says \\u201cyou have a hickey on your neck\\u201d and i said \\u201ci don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s true\\u201d and then i glance at the mirror next to me and realize that in fact i do have a hickey on my neck and i say \\u201ci\\u2019m really sorry\\u201d and she says \\u201cwhere is that from\\u201d and i said \\u201cthere was this bachelorette party and i was drunk\\u201d that sentence never comes out right i mean there\\u2019s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay and\\u2026 we start arguing and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment i didn\\u2019t have a leg to stand on i was like \\u201cwell what about john what was he doing there\\u201d she said \\u201cyou have a hickey on your neck\\u201d i said \\u201cyeah but at least i told you the truth\\u201d and she said \\u201ceventually\\u201d and i said \\u201ceventually is better than never\\u201d and then she kneed me in the balls i don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever experienced this before i\\u2019m sure half of you have not uh\\u2026 it\\u2019s like being electrocuted except you don\\u2019t get to die it\\u2019s like you want to die but you can\\u2019t and there\\u2019s a person in your face saying \\u201cyou deserve this\\u201d which they wouldn\\u2019t even do in electrocutions i think they would deem that as inhumane\\u00a0 even in texas\\njenny says \\u201ci think that we should just break up \\u201cyou know it\\u2019s not just this \\u201ci mean you\\u2019re away a lot of the time \\u201cand even when you\\u2019re here you work at night \\u201cand i work in the day i just don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s gonna work out\\u201d and i said \\u201cokay\\u201d\\u00a0 and we were apart for about six months and i missed her so much but i kept resisting calling her \\u2019cause i wanted to give her space and every once in a while i\\u2019d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from \\u201cjen irish pub nice\\u201d and it would just say \\u201chi\\u201d and i\\u2019d write back \\u201chi\\u201d it was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another but i think in some ways kept us together and finally on new year\\u2019s i caved in and i called her i said \\u201chey i really miss you and i want to see you\\u201d and we got together for coffee and we hit it off just like we used to and we decided we would get back together we had a great period there you know i took her to get a license and a passport first we went for her social security card and then we took that to the dmv and then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport it was like the triple crown of identifications jenny was wildly identifiable one night she was heading back from my apartment to hers and she stops and i said \\u201cwhat\\u201d and she says \\u201ci think that we should live together\\u201d and i said \\u201cno i really don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s a good idea \\u201cyou know i\\u2019ve just decided you know as a principle \\u201ci\\u2019m not gonna get married or live with someone it\\u2019s not personal\\u201d and she said \\u201cwell unless we live together \\u201ci just don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s gonna work out \\u201c\\u2019cause we just don\\u2019t see each other enough \\u201cand i don\\u2019t think that we stand a chance that\\u2019s how i feel\\u201d so we moved in together and one day jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends and she invites me to come along and i said \\u201coh no thanks\\u201d that doesn\\u2019t go over so well she says \\u201cwhy\\u201d and i said \\u201cwell as you know \\u201ci don\\u2019t believe in marriage and so i don\\u2019t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it\\u201d she said \\u201cwell what do you believe in\\u201d and i said \\u201ci don\\u2019t know\\u201d she said \\u201cwell if you don\\u2019t believe in anything how can you not believe in marriage\\u201d and i said \\u201cwell first of all \\u201cyou know it just doesn\\u2019t seem necessary \\u201ci mean is it\\u2026 you know \\u201cmarriage is an archaic institution \\u201cinvented in the middle ages based on exchanging property \\u201ci don\\u2019t want to be a part of that \\u201csecond of all i don\\u2019t even think we have \\u201ca common cultural understanding of what marriage even is \\u201ci mean one of me and andy\\u2019s friends \\u201cwas about to get engaged and we were skeptical \\u201cand we said \\u2018are you sure this is the person \\u201cyou want to be with for the rest of your life\\u2019 \\u201cand he goes \\u2018yeah i think so\\u2019 \\u201cand we said \\u2018well what if she gets in a car accident \\u201cand she\\u2019s disfigured would you stay with her then\\u2019 \\u201cand he said \\u2018maybe\\u2019 \\u201cthat is not an acceptable answer \\u201cthird of all if i\\u2019m so in love \\u201cwhy does it need to be written into a government contract \\u201cand i\\u2019m not one of these like \\u201c\\u2018i don\\u2019t want government up in my business\\u2019 kind of people \\u201ci think the government does a nice job \\u201cdelivering the mail and suggesting i don\\u2019t eat poison \\u201cbut i just don\\u2019t understand why they need to be involved \\u201cin my personal relationships \\u201cthen finally if marriage is religious \\u201cshouldn\\u2019t i believe in the religion \\u201ci\\u2019ve been to more weddings of my friends \\u201cwhere the people on the altar don\\u2019t believe \\u201cin the religion of the church they\\u2019ve invited us to \\u201csome of them even go to classes with the priest \\u201cin advance to more elaborately lie \\u201cabout believing in a religion they don\\u2019t believe in \\u201cjust to have a wedding in a fancy building \\u201cthat is insane that\\u2019s how i feel\\u201d so i explain this to jenny and jenny says \\u201cwell if you ever did want to get married i would marry you\\u201d and i said \\u201cwhy aren\\u2019t you listening to any of this\\u201d and jenny says \\u201cthat\\u2019s how i feel\\u201d at this point it was  in the morning we\\u2019d been arguing all night and we hadn\\u2019t slept i had to catch a flight at  am out of newark airport to los angeles for a show i was doing that night at this point i\\u2019m overtired and i\\u2019m angry and i\\u2019m late i\\u2019m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase and i walk out of our apartment it\\u2019s  am that part of the morning before the earth even exists before they program the matrix or whatever you walk out of your apartment part of the road isn\\u2019t even there there\\u2019s a guy with a laptop going \\u201cwe need a road stat what\\u2019s the code for building tank\\u201d you know and i get to the airport the news hasn\\u2019t even started yet it\\u2019s just an anchor looking around like \\u201cwhat are you up to\\u201d and i get to the kiosk and i print up my ticket and i bring it to the security lady and she looks at me and she goes \\u201cwell that ain\\u2019t your gate\\u201d like i guess they changed the gate but the way she said it was as though i had participated in the decision of changing it i was like \\u201ci was not involved in this process i wasn\\u2019t even cc\\u2019d\\u201d like as though i had gone to the kiosk and been like \\u201c like hell i\\u2019m flying out of \\u201d and then i photoshopped my own ticket printed it out and been like \\u201cthis is where i\\u2019m going\\u201d you know i\\u2019m not that aggressive as a traveler so i was like \\u201cwell where is this gate\\u201d she goes \\u201cit\\u2019s in another terminal you got to take a tram\\u201d she points to the tram and i start walking my roller suitcase and i hear her say \\u201cand you better run\\u201d like i guess i was late at that point so i started running and the roller suitcase does not enjoy running the roller suitcase was like \\u201ci don\\u2019t want to run i have wheels\\u201d and i was like \\u201ci don\\u2019t want to run either but this is what we have to do \\u201ci tell you what when we get to the hotel i\\u2019ll walk you in circles for a few hours\\u201d then i\\u2026 i get to the tram and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives and it says zero minutes i was like \\u201cperfect that\\u2019s exactly how long i want to wait\\u201d but the tram\\u2019s riding away i was like \\u201cthat\\u2019s  minute\\u201d then it says ten minutes and i\\u2019m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like \\u201coh great i\\u2019m gonna miss my flight \\u201cand then i\\u2019m gonna miss every flight from now on \\u201cand i\\u2019m gonna miss my family reunion \\u201cand then i\\u2019m not gonna have a family and then i\\u2019m gonna be a crack whore\\u201d and it\\u2019s like all of a sudden i\\u2019m a crack whore just because i miss this one flight i can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and\\u2026\\ni get on the next tram ten minutes later and i run to the gate and i\\u2019m sweaty and i\\u2019m out of breath but i\\u2019m on time and i\\u2019m so relieved that i sit down in a chair at the gate and i fall asleep and i wake up to the sound of the door shutting i jump up and the door is closed and i am on the sad side of the door the happy side has an airplane and a pilot the sad side is me and the cinnabon lady normally i\\u2019d be very excited if it were just me and the cinnabon lady i\\u2019m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year i think that\\u2019s an effective use of time but in this instance i needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane and the cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community i was like \\u201cdo you know these people\\u201d she was like \\u201call i know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun\\u201d i ran up to the giant glass window i started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy i was like \\u201cdrew barrymore\\u2019s character come back\\u201d she didn\\u2019t come back and i missed my flight i got on the next one they could get me on there was a stopover in texas you know how i feel about texas and uh i get to los angeles late that night and i\\u2019d missed my show i\\u2019d never missed one of my shows before and i\\u2019m so angry and jenny\\u2019s calling me but i\\u2019m not picking up the phone \\u2019cause i\\u2019m blaming this entire day on her i get back to my friend andy\\u2019s house and i said \\u201candy this relationship is messing up my entire life\\u201d and andy goes \\u201cyou\\u2019re right\\u201d i go \\u201ci know i\\u2019m right\\u201d he goes \\u201cyeah you\\u2019re right\\u201d i go \\u201ci know i\\u2019m right i got to tell her about this in the morning\\u201d i drive out of andy\\u2019s small road and i\\u2019m tboned that\\u2019s the culinary way of describing it in   seconds i\\u2019m spun around and i think i\\u2019m dead no wait i\\u2019m paralyzed and then i hear nothing then i hear the other car skid out and drive away  minutes later i\\u2019m sitting on a curb at this point the police have arri\\u2026 have arrived as well as my friend andy and that\\u2019s when i start crying you know how when you drop a baby on the ground it doesn\\u2019t\\u2026 doesn\\u2019t start crying right away because it doesn\\u2019t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face and then it\\u2019s like \\u201coh i guess i should be doing something \\u201cthat matches that waah\\u201d i\\u2019m crying because i\\u2019m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that in that moment i might have ceased to exist like i said earlier i don\\u2019t really believe in anything so in my mind that would have been the end of all things i\\u2019d experienced in my life every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion and\\u2026 the officer comes over and he says \\u201cwhat happened\\u201d and i said \\u201ci got hit by this car \\u201cand then i heard nothing and then i heard the other car skid out and drive away\\u201d the officer points over to the light the other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree i can\\u2019t help but think \\u201cthat\\u2019s karma that\\u2019s a hit and run and hit\\u201d and then the officer puts this form in my face and he goes \\u201csign this\\u201d and i said \\u201cwell what does it mean\\u201d and he goes \\u201cit means you\\u2019re okay and that we can leave\\u201d i was really shaken up i was like \\u201ci don\\u2019t know if i\\u2019m okay\\u201d and he goes \\u201cjust sign it\\u201d which is a very unattractive quality when someone just repeats a command that you\\u2019ve just said no to and it\\u2019s unattractive but very effective you know i signed it andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution but we have to wait two hours \\u2019cause the other driver had beat us there and\\u2026 eventually we\\u2019re with the doctor and andy says to him he goes \\u201cwell was the other guy drunk\\u201d and the doctor says \\u201cwell i can\\u2019t answer that\\u201d and andy says \\u201cwas he\\u201d he uses the technique we had learned earlier and it works you know the doctor says \\u201cwell he\\u2019s heading to jail now\\u201d and andy and i flash each other a look like the hardy boys like \\u201ccase closed\\u201d a few hours later we\\u2019re back at andy\\u2019s house it\\u2019s probably around  in the morning and i have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have neardeath experiences i say \\u201ci need to call jenny and tell her that we need to get married\\u201d and andy says \\u201cmike\\u2026 sleep on it\\u201d and i said \\u201cno no no this makes perfect sense\\u201d and i pick up my phone and i dial her number and he puts his hand over the phone and he says \\u201cmike\\u2026 sleep on it\\u201d he saves me the next morning i fly back to new york and a few weeks later i get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that i just described and it had found me at fault and that i owed\\u2026 and i\\u2019m not making this up\\u2026  for the repairs on the other driver\\u2019s mercedes suv and i was like \\u201cwell this can\\u2019t be happening\\u201d i explained to the woman \\u201ci think it\\u2019s a misunderstanding \\u201cthe other guy was clearly drunk it was definitely not my fault\\u201d and she said \\u201ci\\u2019m really sorry but unless they change the accident report you owe this money\\u201d so i requested the accident report and i\\u2019m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight i don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever seen one of these things before\\u2026 but it\\u2019s a little bit like homework for cops and officer timson not so good with the homework he consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two vehicle one and vehicle two at one point so badly that he says \\u2026 that\\u2019s me\\u2026 started to go but all of a sudden \\u2026 that\\u2019s me also\\u2026 came at a high rate of speed crashing into him now i\\u2019m pretty selfdestructive as a person but i would never crash into my own car with my own car nor would i understand how you could do that this part is even crazier the other driver\\u2019s statement at the scene of the accident was \\u201ci was on venice going\\u2026 uh i\\u2019m not too sure \\u201ci was going away from the beach \\u201ci was driving \\u201ci don\\u2019t know what happened \\u201cdid i hurt anyone \\u201ci don\\u2019t know where i was going \\u201cbut i came from home i had a sip of beer\\u201d which is really everyone\\u2019s favorite quantity of beer just the one sip right that\\u2019s what they serve these days at the homebeachpub\\nso all of it\\u2019s mine the officer makes one key mistake he checks the box that finds me at fault so i\\u2019m like \\u201ci need to get officer timson on the phone so we can clear up this misunderstanding\\u201d the problem is he keeps ducking my calls and i know \\u2019cause i\\u2019m calling two or three times a day leaving messages calling departments next to his department so he knows i\\u2019m trying to reach him and finally after a month of this i get him on the phone and i\\u2019m so relieved and i explain this misunderstanding and he listens to me and he says \\u201cdo the right thing and pay for the guy\\u2019s car\\u201d i know and i mean that\\u2019s what i said i go \\u201caren\\u2019t you listening to any of this\\u201d i go \\u201cand this guy was clearly drunk \\u201ci mean he nearly killed me \\u201cinches from where he hit \\u201cand i would be dead right now \\u201cand he wants me to pay for his car \\u201cdon\\u2019t you see how crazy that is just as one human being to another\\u201d and he says \\u201cdo the right thing and pay for the guy\\u2019s car\\u201d and he hangs up the phone and at this point this stops being about money and it\\u2019s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law this is chinatown so i started printing up google maps of the scene of the accident and california state driving law i\\u2019m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators there\\u2019s only one lawyer who would consider the case and he was an accident lawyer and he said \\u201cdid you have any loss of income from the accident\\u201d and i said \\u201cno\\u201d and he says \\u201cdid you have any loss of income from the accident\\u201d and i said \\u201cno this isn\\u2019t about money\\u201d and he doesn\\u2019t take the case and this is when i start going completely mad\\ni\\u2019m up to about  or  am every night just surfing the web i get a subscription to a site called netdetectivecom which is a great site for vigilantes who have  so now i know this guy\\u2019s name i know where he lives i know what he does for a living and in my mind it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller like \\u201cjim bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this \\u201cbut jim bosworth had another thing coming mike birbiglia\\u201d i was like \\u201ci\\u2019m gonna track down jim bosworth \\u201ci\\u2019m gonna sue jim bosworth and i\\u2019m gonna sue the entire los angeles police department\\u201d at this point people stopped talking to me entirely my friends would call me like \\u201chey what\\u2019s going on\\u201d i\\u2019d be like \\u201ci\\u2019ll tell you what\\u2019s going on\\u201d i\\u2019d tell them this whole story and they\\u2019d be like \\u201cyou should get a lawyer\\u201d i\\u2019d be like \\u201cthis is way past lawyers a lawyer wouldn\\u2019t even touch this\\u201d \\u2018cause he wouldn\\u2019t\\nthe only person who would talk to me at this point was jenny one night we were out to dinner at a restaurant and she\\u2019s talking to me but i\\u2019m not listening \\u2019cause i\\u2019m writing down ideas i have for the case on my napkin i\\u2019ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in the laws the other driver broke and the phone numbers i\\u2019m gonna call that week and i\\u2019m so angry i\\u2019m writing over my own handwriting to the point where i\\u2019m ripping through the napkin and jenny looks at me and she says \\u201cwhat are you doing\\u201d and i said \\u201cwell this is my case\\u201d and she says \\u201cwell why don\\u2019t you work on that in the morning\\u201d and i said \\u201cwell which part of this napkin don\\u2019t you understand\\u201d jenny says \\u201cmike\\u2026 \\u201cyou\\u2019re right \\u201cbut it\\u2019s only hurting you \\u201cand i\\u2019m just so glad that you\\u2019re alive and i think that we should focus on that\\u201d she only has to say it once and i give up the case and i pay for this guy\\u2019s car july   jenny and i went to city hall and got married i still didn\\u2019t believe in the idea

boston i appreciate that  uh thats very sweet of you  love you im at the end of the tour right now im very happy to be on tour because i now have a child ah so any time out of home is good for me um i got my girlfriend pregnant after knowing her for two months so  thank you thank you life decisions and shes a nice girl and i love her in a way sure my problem with my girlfriend is shes very sweet but shes shit at telling stories and im awesome at telling stories so it really bothers me when she talks and i dont know if thatll be a problem in the future but its a problem now and i dont see it getting better um ill give you an example right i was in the car and my son hank was asleep in the back seat and were driving along and on the radio comes madonna and my girlfriend just slips into conversation oh i used to party with madonna and i went you fucking what when and she went i used to party with madonna now i should fill you in a little bit on this my girlfriend used to be a model in miami right im not bragging i didnt get the model years i didnt get those years ive seen the photos very impressive um so i said so you used to party with madonna madonna used to have big parties and invite models over right and she went no no it would just be me and a few other people i go you need to elaborate on this story right now and she goes oh okay i used to date the center for the miami heat as soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an nba center even if this guys even slightly in proportion a lot of things flood through your head first thing is thats why your cunts so fucked up thats a big one thats why our child came out while you were walking i understand so she said i used to date the center for the miami heat his best friend was dennis rodman dennis rodman used to go out with madonna and we used to go over to madonnas house and she goes this one time the four of us were over at madonnas house and we were all fucked up on drugs and one thing led to another and then i went shut the fuck up and she went what i said i know what one thing led to another means you all started fucking each other and she went we did we started just shut up and she goes what do you care for i said youre the mother of my child i dont wanna picture you being fucked by a \\u2033 nba player while youre licking out madonnas muscular vagina and dennis rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock going  and she goes oh youre being silly what do you care for youve partied way more than i have in my life and i went that is not true ive gotten wasted way more than you have but i have in no way partied way more than you have often i get wasted just by myself i wouldnt call it a party for most of my career i was a struggling comedian right and this is how struggling comedians party right its  am monday right were in a onebedroom apartment seven of us are standing around a coffee table trying to stretch out two grams of coke one of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories and the rest of us are talking about where women might be one of us has come up with a plan the plan goes like this well nurses will be finishing their shift soon maybe if we just stand out the front of the er theyll appreciate seven funny guys  i dont you know ive never partied like a model i have partied twice in my life twice like really partied ive had good nights out but ive really partied twice if you really party and most people never experience this its an amazing thing it happens in vegas it can only happen in vegas and its gotta involve celebrity right im not famous but the people around me were super famous and i was at this party in the night club and they took me in and then theres the night club but then theres the real night club out the back which is like the size of this stage its only a little room and you go back there and you can just they encourage you to take drugs in the open and youre just doing it off a key  and theyre going no dude use the table dont use your and i go oh oh oh sorry um and its confusing at first and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room just bring em in like huh and you can do this you can go uh like that and theyll drag these women away it is the best thing youll ever do with your life when you party that hard as a man theres a lot of remorse cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money you wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover and you go to your friends you go oh my god we partied so hard last night i spent  when a hot girl parties that hard she wakes up in the morning and goes oh my god we partied so hard last night i made  and thats a vastly different emotion that i dont think women will never yeah okay this is the thing in america at the moment theyre trying to raise the minimum wage to i dont know  an hour or something like that and whenever they bring up this argument they always go and still to this day women only earn  of what men earn in the workplace and of course thats disgusting how dare women earn so much like a lot of things that i say tonight will be jokes that i dont actually mean but this is something im really passionate about women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace im sorry i  im not being a misogynistic bastard right im not saying that women dont work as hard im sure they do im not saying they dont do as good a job what im saying is they dont deserve to earn as much money as men right men need that extra  to buy meals and drinks and jim jefferies tickets and all that shit  now im sure theres women in this room that are saying oh i pay for my drinks i bought my own ticket and dont think we dont appreciate the uglies cause we do right we do but theres little things in society that you cant change men have extra expenses that youll never understand theres holidays that are just for women like valentines day is just for women they say its for romantics they say its for couples or something like that its just for women theres no man who gets excited by valentines day theres no man that when he sees the valentines day decorations go up in the shopping mall he goes oh valentines day is coming valentines day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head and it goes like this how much money do i have to spend today so that you wont act like a cunt it doesnt stop there mothers day mothers day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old my girlfriends first mothers day and she went oh i wonder what ill get for mothers day and i went probably fucking nothing hes got no money hes six months old what do you think hes gonna buy you within an hour her friends were over at the house just by coincidence telling me what a bad person i was and how important mothers day is to a new mum you know and so i went and bought her a cappuccino machine cause i assumed thats what hank would have wanted her to have and i wrote a card im not a bastard i wrote a card im righthanded so i got my left hand every new dad knows this you get the crayon and you go  happy mothers day love hank and i went han and then i did the k backtofront because hes a fucking moron see now i know theres people in the room theyre thinking well fathers have fathers day fathers day is bullshit its fucking shit fathers day fathers day came around and my girlfriend went what do you want for fathers day and i went i dont want anything dont even worry about it i dont want anything and she goes come on you gotta have something i said honestly i dont want anything and she goes come on and i went its my fucking money just dont touch it just leave my money alone how hard is this how about for  hours you dont touch my fucking money that would be a gift thats why every single father has that one fathers day gift that they cherish and its shit its like a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handles too big and it says i heart dad and they keep that for  fucking years this mug and do you wanna know why they like it every now and again they look at it and go that cost me nothing that mug  see wouldnt it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff but didnt cost anything that everyone could participate in right ive got it right april  anal sex day  its good isnt it everyones girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on april  its nice a month before youd be walking around the shopping center going oh the decorations are up  and its good cause if your bird didnt take it in the ass you could do the same thing that women do on valentines day when they dont get a gift you could go like oh me mate jason his wife took it in the ass twice yeah obviously theyre more connected than we are theyve uh im thinking i dont do much merchandise after my shows and stuff but im thinking of bringing out some april  tshirts not even putting jim jefferies on them or anything just tshirts that say april  cause its good right youre in a bar youre a guy you see a guy at the other end of the bar with an april  and you go fucking friends for life right but even better you see a girl with an april  tshirt the weird thing is im biggingup anal sex here and i dont even really like fucking girls in the ass that much im not even a huge fan i much prefer the cunt i think its a much more i think that a cunt is a much more purposebuilt thing to fuck but you know anal sex oh you know i do it i get involved cause i feel like i have to you know i but ive never been a big fan of the ass fucking i uh when i watch it on porn it seems very inviting the girls taking it so fluently in her ass and she seems to be having fun and uh but the thing is you cant smell porn you dont smell porn you just you just watch it they never and its different porn its different they clean the girls asshole they pump water into it until its very hygienic im sure and the girl seems to be so happy shes like youve got it in her pussy youre fucking her and then shes like put it in my ass shes inviting its like youre doing her a favor in porn and then shes like she says things i dont know things like im enjoying that keep putting it in my ass fuck my ass i love a cock in my ass and and the experience ive had in my own life has been vastly different ive my experience has been a lot of crying now although that can help you come at times its not what you want its not what you want for every day i like the girl who acts like shes enjoying it like you know when your girlfriends like im gonna act like i enjoy it she does that whole yeah oh no thats good  ahh \\u266a im having a good time \\u266a and then theyre always going are you done are you close to done you never fuck a pussy and they go are you almost done finish this like that if youre fucking ass they dont want you they want it all over quick and they do other things the porn girls i dont know how much they get paid im sure its more than what the men get paid its the opposite bit of society um but they do a thing called atm i dont know if you know what that is kids that stands for ass to mouth thats where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus and shell put it directly in her mouth and shell say something like i love the taste of my ass let me taste my ass and then the man as a favor to this woman puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work  shes been doing now i had a drunken night with my exgirlfriend where she thought shed be all wild and try that once again vastly different experience im not a big fan of the ass fucking and i dont know of any man if theyre truthful really is now theres women in the room who are thinking well why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass  what a good question  women the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because we know you fucking hate it  so im a father um i love my son i love my son the same way that i love cigarettes i like to hold him for five minutes every hour and the rest of the time im thinking about how hes fucking killing me hes a good little boy no hes a great little fella i really like him um my girlfriend super loves him though its fucking creepy and im glad i have a son that worked out good for me i wouldnt be a good father to a girl it wouldnt be good for me nothing weird wouldnt fuck it i i just dont get along with women you know how it is i dont want them in my house and so because you dream see for example okay when hank was born the couple over the road within two weeks of hank being born had a baby girl and rightly or wrongly the first thing that went through my head was aw thats great i hope hank fucks that one day thats what i think cause thats what i think about my son i hope when hes of age he just fucks everything i dont care if my son is gay or straight all i care about is when he is of age that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires that is my dream for my son  but never in the history of fathers and daughters has a father held his baby girl and gone oh i hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life i hope youre never shy of a cock i hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up right you know and its not just me women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well my girlfriend goes to the gym every morning i go there very occasionally and when you go to the gym theres a little daycare cr\\u00e8che thing in the gym where you can hand your child off and inside that daycare theres like three women in their  theyre very nice ladies and you hand your kid off and he plays then when you finish your workout you come and get him and theres a woman that works there who just loves my son she sees all the other kids but she loves hank and hank fucking loves her and the two of them light up when they see each other and its super cute i bring hank up the stairs and he starts going uh uh trying to reach at her all right and she does this she goes everyone my boyfriends here heres my boyfriend give him here hes my boyfriend and then she kisses him and she goes \\u266a my boyfriend gives me kisses my boyfriend gives me kisses \\u266a its fucking adorable but i tried doing that with a baby girl lets say you go to the gym and theres a daycare and me and a couple of my mates are working there hey everyone me girlfriends here give her here give her here shes my girlfriend my girlfriend gives me kisses you know that right shes always giving me kisses enjoy your workout dont worry about a thing   so also its just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter its just little things even when theyre babies its just easier theres a wiping technique when youre wiping a babys ass i dont know if you have children but this is how you do it the baby lays on its back you put their feet together you lift the feet up and then you go in and wipe with a boy you can wipe like that up and down side to side whatever the fuck you want right with a girl you gotta wipe downward and away downward and away its very important that you wipe away from the cunt very important cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts they do they fucking hate it boys dont give a shit fucking my son will have shit all over his dick and balls and ill be cleaning it off under the foreskin and hell be laughing like its the best day ever even at my age now i find it funny if i have shit on my dick if i fuck my girlfriend in the ass i pull out ive got shit on my dick ill ring me mate jason up and go hey jason its happened again i got shit on my dick and hell tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick and well laugh and laugh and laugh but never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and shes thought oh i cant wait to call karen   when you when my girlfriend got pregnant when you meet when you havent got a child couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children whenever you meet couples with children theyre always like it is the most fulfilling thing ive ever done with my life my heart grows larger and larger every day and then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant those same people went like this youre never gonna sleep again  forget about it its over youre not gonna sleep theyre constantly telling you youre not gonna sleep raising a baby is not that hard ill tell you what its easier than a coke habit i had a coke habit for sevenandahalf fucking years at least its not me who wakes up crying anymore i can sleep through other people crying ive had girlfriends thats like white noise to me i find it soothing see me and my girlfriend just two months we went fuck it lets have a kid fucking did it right these other people man you know these couples and they date from high school and then they go out for a bit longer and then after being together for like seven years they go were getting engaged you wanna come to the party and you wanna say no youre really boring and we hate you but you go oh okay great youre still together are you you fucked one person have you oh how exciting and and then what they do is they dont have a kid right away because theyre still not ready we have to see how our careers are going and shit and what they do is they get a dog and then they act like the fucking dogs their baby they refer to it as their fucking baby they send you a christmas card of them holding the dog and it says from our family to yours and then you have a barbecue and you invite them the humans right then they come over this fucking dog runs in jumping over everything and youre like what the fuck is this shit and theyre like we had to bring him we bring our baby everywhere and you go well your baby is biting my actual baby can you control and then eventually they decide theyre gonna have a kid cause theyve learned so much from the dog and then they bring the kid back and the dog runs up like whats happening a new person and theyre like fuck off we dont love you anymore were going and they think theyve learnt something from the dog and they havent learnt anything what happens if your girlfriends away on work and the dog dies you go off you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog try to pass it off as the same dog what happens if your girlfriends away on work and the baby dies very hard to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have easier if youre black or asian  boston no no no shut up i will not put up with racism at my shows okay im not saying cause they look the same im saying cause theyre easier to purchase   if angelina jolie and madonna have taught us anything it is that you can buy black and asian people im yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from norway with a child going yolanda quick get hans bring him over come on  im gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit uh gun control now no wait before you dont get excited because the other people have guns the antigun people are like yeah do it jim no lets just  now before i start saying this i wanna say this right i believe in your right as americans to have guns im not trying to stop you from having guns all im saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion my opinion on the oh it doesnt matter i dont like guns right im gonna say some things that are just facts right in australia we had guns right right up until  in  australia had the biggest massacre on earth it still hasnt been beaten and now after that they banned the guns now in the  years before port arthur there was  massacres since the gun ban in  there hasnt been a single massacre since i dont know how or why this happened uh maybe it was a coincidence right now please understand that i understand that australia and america are two vastly different cultures with different people right i get it in australia we had the biggest massacre on earth and the australian government went thats it no more guns and we all went yeah all right then that seems fair enough really now in america you had the sandy hook massacre where little tiny children died and your government went maybe well get rid of the big guns and  of you went fuck you dont take my guns  so heres where it gets confusing right now as i said i am all for your second amendment rights i think you should be able to have guns its in your constitution what i am not for is bullshit arguments and lies there is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun and this is the argument fuck off i like guns its not the best argument but its all youve got and theres nothing wrong with it theres nothing wrong with saying i like something dont take it away from me but dont give me this other bullshit the main one is  i need it for protection i need to protect me i need to protect my family really is that why theyre called assault rifles is it ive never heard of these fucking protection rifles you speak of protection what the fuck are you talking about you have a gun in your house youre  more likely to use that gun on yourself than to shoot someone else and people think well thatd never happen to me you dont know that because you know what\\u266a from time to time we all get sad \\u266a \\u266a one day youre happy then youre sad \\u266a \\u266a and then uhoh \\u266aprotection i had a breakin in manchester england where i was tied up i had my head cut they threatened to rape my girlfriend they came through the window with a machete and a hammer and americans always go  well imagine if you had a gun and im like all right i was naked at the time i wasnt wearing my holster i wasnt staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through what world do you live in where youre constantly fucking ready you have guns cause you like guns thats why you go to gun conventions thats why you read gun magazines none of you give a shit about home security none of you go to home security conventions none of you read padlock monthly none of you have a facebook picture of you behind a secure door going fucking yeah like youre going to be ready if someone comes into your house you have it at all fucking times by the way most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking tv you think that people are coming to murder your family how many fucking enemies do you have jeez you think a lot of yourself if you think everyones coming to murder you see if you have it readily available it becomes unsafe you have it in your bedside table one of your kids picks it up thinks its a toy shoots another one of your kids happens every fucking day but people go thatd never happen in my house cause im a responsible gun owner i keep my guns locked in a safe then theyre no fucking protection someone comes into the house youre like wait there fuckface oh youve come to the wrong house here buddy boy i tell you what im gonna fuck you up okay is it  to the left or  to the right your mothers birthday why the fuck would i know your fucking mothers birthday maybe if you didnt leave the window open  because its too hot in here we wouldnt be getting fucking murdered right i find the nra to be hard work the fact that they always think the answer is more guns after sandy hook happened the nra said and i quote none of this would have happened if the teachers had guns i i think theyre forgetting what school was like does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to whenever she came into school that relief teacher came you and your friends would see her and go  oh were gonna make her cry and then shed stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking and youd go youre never getting married are you miss never gonna happen for you then shed get back to her  volkswagen beetle and shed be crying over the steering wheel just why dont they like me lets give that cunt a gun and see how things work out  and then they go oh well answer to that well just add more guns they go well put an armed security guard at every school across america yeah thatll work out the average security guard in america earns  an hour not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero someone comes onto the school and  and youve got kevin now im sure kevins shithot at call of duty but it might not fucking cut it ladies and gentlemen now i understand that when im doing this joke in this room  of you agree with me  of you dont agree with me and i do respect the people who dont agree with me dont think i dont out of the  that dont agree with me  of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and its not to be taken seriously and theyre laughing along cause its just funny jokes right and then the next  have sort of phased out a little bit theyre looking around going wonder how they got that chandelier up there and then theres the last  and theyre fucking furious right now in this room and the people watching at home  of you are fucking seething just and for a couple of reasons first reason im making good points  second reason second reason second reason and this is the big one im foreign and thats pissing the fuck out of you right now and your brain is on a loop and you cant fucking turn it off and its just going around in a circle and youre just going if you dont like it go home if you dont like it go home and my answer to that is no i came here legally i pay my taxes ill say whatever the fuck i want your first amendment means that i can say the second amendment sucks dicks and unless youre an american indian youre a fucking immigrant as well so fuck off people get so precious about it i understand that to americans your constitution is very important i respect it but please understand that every country has one as well its no more special than any other constitution we have one in australia i dont know what it says ive never seen it if theres a problem well check it but everythings going fine and dont get me wrong i get that the constitution is important to you i have had fucking i get it right ive had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as im leaving the theater going  you cannot change the second amendment and im like yes you can its called an amendment if you cant change something thats called an amendment see many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution and if you dont know what a thesaurus is get a dictionary and work your way forward dont think your constitution is set in stone youve changed things before you used to have prohibition in there right and then people were like hey who likes getting fucked up yeah i like getting fucked up too lets get that one out lets get that one out you used to have this other thing in america called uh slavery and then lincoln came along and went thats it no more slaves and  of you went fuck you dont take my slaves and the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns why should i have my slaves taken off me im a responsible slave owner im trained in how to use my slaves safely just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesnt mean that my rights should be taken away from me i i use my slaves to protect my family i keep my slaves locked in a safe thats the thing why should i have my guns taken off me ive done nothing wrong look i agree with you if youre a responsible gun owner and you dont fuck around with them then you should be allowed your guns you really should but thats not how society works we have to play to the  that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us we have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving right i take drugs like a fucking champion right  we should all be allowed to take fucking drugs but we cant can we because sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids oh oh thanks sarah you fucked it up for everyone right everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it right but we cant because jonathan got drunk and ran over a family thanks jonathan now i have to drive at  you fucking idiot see thats the thing why should i have my guns taken off me im responsible just because that guys crazy whos to say youre not crazy thats the thing about crazy people they dont know theyre crazy thats what makes them crazy the only thing you know for sure on this earth is i think therefore i am you know that you exist anything past that is open to interpretation right you know you exist and thats it right now i think im in boston talking to  people thats what i think im doing but there is a good to fair chance that im in a mental home standing in front of a white wall going  i hate guns i hate guns i hate guns  see one of the better arguments is well if you take the guns away then only the criminals will have guns not true when they banned the guns in australia it worked when they banned them in britain it worked okay the bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in sandy hook costs like  american and you can buy it in walmart itll be delivered to your house thats it man  bucks right that same gun in australia on the black market costs  now if you have  you dont need to be a criminal youve got  youre a great little saver keep going so that covers the criminals but that doesnt cover the people who wanna murder your family that are coming after you and your family it kind of does the people who do the massacres it covers them cause they go the kid at colorado who thought he was the joker lets say that he had some social issues the kid at sandy hook was aspergers as fuck right i dont know if you know a lot about the black market but you cant just rock up at the docks going  guns who wants to sell me a gun now im gonna wrap this up we wont talk about it anymore now see the one thing that i do really agree with with the right to bear arms i really agree with that the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government in case the government became a bunch of cunts you could all get your guns and fight back and thats why it was written \\u2013  \\u2013 yeah and that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets but you do know the government has drones right you get that youre bringing guns to a drone fight if we went back to muskets im all for it keep the second amendment if we all have muskets muskets are awesome every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times you know whats good about the musket it gives you a lot of time to calm down someone calls your wife fat and youre like fuck you buddy ah youre not a bad guy youre all right now after the show were gonna go out have a big party around boston see how it goes im not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore my girlfriend has said thats a no cause i dont behave myself in there so im not allowed to go to them anymore cause strip clubs arent what women think they are  it used to be like okay so when a man goes to a strip club its all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible thats what men want to see women when they go to their magic mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are women wanna see a guy hey ladies hes a fireman and he comes out with his hose and like that and whenever a stripper takes their clothes off theyve still got the firemans hat on or a tool belt on or policemans gun on a holster right because even when a mans naked a woman wants to know that he has a job when men watch strippers we want them to have a job and that jobs stripping we want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money and just go you cant take care of your kids its and when men get private dances in these strip clubs i dont know i dont know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms but basically its dry humping theres no dancing the girl gets in front she gets where your cock is pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face and you go thats what a private dance is right i dont know if theres private dancing in female strip clubs  i cant imagine that there would be i dont imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going she goes how was it and she goes well he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead i got to go to the atm so legit got canceled  yeah i know i know it who wouldve thought it wouldve struggled on that great fxx channel that everyone knew about the first season is on netflix this special is being recorded for netflix so you can go watch it there if youre watching the special it was im very proud of it we had two great seasons of really good television and if people didnt now the whole tv show is based around one standup routine that i used to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that i took to a brothel which is a true story and so when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who in the end we used dj qualls and dj qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie road trip hes the skinny white guy out of the movie hustle  flow and hes the white guy out of the movie hustle  flow now the great thing about dj is he already looks disabled he has that latter stages of aids thing going on its great for casting anyway but i didnt want dj to begin with i wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic and the actors union of america said you cannot do that because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy i think are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired and i said all right what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer and they sent me a list and on this list i said can you get rid of all the contagious ones and what have we got left so i saw every disabled actor in hollywood and ill be honest with you not that many of them i dont know why maybe theyre just lazy they dont wanna work maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly and none of them were very good either everyone we saw none of them were very good cause acting is all about what you do with your hands none of them knew what to do with their hands and they all came in until this one guy came in i had seen a lot of people that day this guy was the most disabled person id ever seen in my life he was like think of the most disabled person youve seen then double it really super disabled he was shaped like a pretzel he was being carried in by this big russian nurse carried him in he made that great disabled sound of  that one i just loved him anyway so he comes in for the audition and im sitting there and were doing the lines together and at first i didnt know if he was mentally all there either so i was being a little bit patronizing i was going thank you so much for coming in and then we did the dialog together and i didnt have to worry about a thing this kid was funny he was smart his timing was impeccable i thought he was just great and i helped him out of the room and i come back to the director and i said thats our guy thats who we gotta pick and he agreed but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room so the next bloke wheels himself in now obviously hes just a paraplegic if hes wheeling himself in which means the waist down and that didnt really suit me because paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance but i thought if hes a good enough actor maybe he can quadup for the role so he comes in he comes in i shake his hand and his leg slightly comes out at the same time and i went whoa whats going on there kicky and he goes oh you got me im not disabled and i said youre fucking what now and he goes im not disabled i just really wanted the role so i rented a wheelchair and i said just shut up so let me this is how your day has mappedout thus far you woke up this morning you drove to the wheelchair rental place you rented a wheelchair you carried it out i assume you put it in the trunk of your car you drove here you got the wheelchair out you carried it up three flights of stairs you went to the waiting room you put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse then you sat in it and practiced your lines and he went yeah and i said youre a fucking asshole mate get the fuck out of here and i kicked him out and later on that day im sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors im gonna call to tell them theyve got parts and im holding this disabled guys headshot and i just think im gonna call this guy up im gonna change his life this is an awesome moment right and im looking at it and he looks super handsome in his headshot he looked really like and i thought this has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history the shutter on his camera has gotta be like  like  and then i read the guys biography and then it dawned on me this guys not disabled either i hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair this cunt rented a nurse do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse im all for a method actor get into character three hours before but once you finish the audition stand up and go tada and we would have gone that was very good but ill tell you what you dont do dont make me carry you to your car i carried him down three flights of stairs going you did very good hes like thank you jim   i was uh i go to a therapist cause i get depressed so i got a therapist every now and again i literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like im gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind like just out of the movies right and she went red and i went blue and then she went cooking and i went food and all that type of stuff we went like this forever and then she went for the last question she went and whats your favorite thing in the world and i went coming on a girls face now now i couldve said things like ice cream is a good answer hank wouldve been an excellent answer but i said coming on a girls face and ive had six months to think about my answer and i stand by it \\u2013 i \\u2013  im not proud of it i hate myself for thinking it its such a horrible thing to do to another human when a girls on her knees and you its so and as an atheist i believe in darwin and all the things that he wrote but he never had a bit where he explained that there was never a bit in his book where he went when a caveman loves a cavewoman hell ejaculate on her face so that flies wont come near there was never that never that moment but by golly if its not fun i find it to look to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time may i say bravo dont dont think what you do has gone unnoticed we notice we appreciate your work i think you deserve a parade of some kind during memorial day after the vietnam vets before the first gulf war guys we could bring in and heres the women who take a load on their face and you could march out and married men would stand there going god bless you ladies  i enjoy your acting that you do the standard tongue out and the like that i dont know why but i enjoy i know its a lie i know youre not excited but i still appreciate the effort is what i enjoy i love the look because its such a oh jeez im excited too when this come hits my face theres a good chance ill also orgasm anything could happen in this crazy world but this is what redeems us as men this is what redeems us just know that the second the come shoots out of our cock and hits your face our bodies flood with remorse the next  seconds is the nicest we will ever be to you  i go from being an animal to the sweetest guy on earth im like you fucking slut oh i love you ah uh all right no no no put your tongue back in um keep your eyes shut just keep them shut uh all right im going to get a towel ill get a towel ill get you a towel all right youre a wonderful mother to our child   see this is what kills me my son will one day watch this dvd and im the guy whos meant to teach him right from wrong and im there wiping come off his mothers face i think i did something illegal with my son the other day i think it might be illegal tell me if this is illegal all right im in the shower my girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning and when she came back i was in the shower and hank ran up and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like argh like that and i went  and i saw his little face and i went hello hankie and then in the condensation i drew a little bowtie on him and a little suit and then i gave him a voice bubble that said i love my daddy love hank but i did it so i could read it well of course he could read the k and then i stepped out i stepped out of the bathroom and i went gday hankie and he slapped my cock and he ran off now is that illegal i dont know is it illegal because a a child touched my cock or because b i found it really funny and ive been telling everyone and i cant get angry at him because his whole life hes been lying on mats with things dangling over hes been training for this his entire life i think ive uh i think ive become american more american than i am australian lately and there was a moment where i tipped over where i went oh i think like an american person now and im happy to do it i just ill tell you what happened i was flying around i was doing a tour of australia and i was flying domestically around australia and im so used to airports and stuff here in america that okay what happens is when you go i was flying sydney to melbourne when you fly domestically in australia you go up to the machine put your name in prints your ticket out it prints your bag thing you put the bag thing on your bag yourself and then theres a conveyor belt underneath you throw your bag on bag fucks off you dont speak to anyone then i go up to the gate bit and the ladys going tickets please and im holding my id out like a fucking simpleton cause i get through airports quick man im like fucking there you go and she went put your id away i dont need to see that and i went i think you do and she went i dont why would i need to see your id and i said i might be a terrorist and she went would showing me your id stop you from blowing the plane up no id probably still blow the plane up so then i get up to the tsa conveyor belt thing and im so good at the airports im already taking my shoes off as im walking right and all the australians behind me assume that im american and theyre losing their fucking shit theyre like oh for fucks sake one of these cunts eh and the tsa guy goes hey mate what are you taking your shoes off for and i went  i dont know maybe theyre bombs and he went but theyre not are they i put me shoes back on i get my laptop out everyones going mental and the tsa guy says very politely but extraordinarily sarcastically he goes jeez mate thats a nice computer why are you showing it to everyone it might also be a bomb and then the guy said the most australian thing ive ever heard come out of anyones mouth ever he went oh come on mate you wouldnt have two bombs   im not even quite sure what that means but it does make some type of sense all right oscar pistorius if you havent been following the case youre missing out this is the greatest thing since oj simpson youre fucking missing out mate if you dont know who oscar pistorius is let me fill you in oscar pistorius is a legless man from south africa known as the blade runner he ran in two olympics the disabled and the ablebodied olympics in one year no one has ever done that hes an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and ablebodied people alike and on valentines day last year he shot and killed the hottest girl on earth and thats when he became an inspiration to me cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there you cant just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want  people have feelings you cunts now theres a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day one of the theories is that they found in her phone he went through her phone and on her phone he found some text messages from a south african rugby player on valentines day right now i dont know if youve ever been to south africa but in south africa rugby is more popular than legless running it goes rugby legless running cricket legless runnings their second sport you wouldnt have thought that anyway im going to reenact what i believe happened that day to do that i will now be doing a south african accent now i know many of you cant tell the difference between my accent and a south african accent heres the difference picture my accent but im punching a black person what im trying to say is south africans are horrible people so shes coming out of the shower shes been drying her hair shes listening to rodriguez or something she comes out hes laying on the bed he looks up at her hes holding the phone and he goes  what the fuck is this ive been through your phone you have been texting a rugby player and shes like oh fuck you who the fuck do you think you are who am i im oscar pistorius the greatest legless runner that has ever been thats who the fuck i am well i would rather be with a rugby player at least he is a whole man not a threequarter man like you \\u2013  \\u2013 i know  oh fuck you no fuck you im leaving you and then she storms out of the room and then he was like you fucking bitch  i hate you  you will rue the day that you left oscar pistorius the blade runner dont go anywhere  i hate you thats where he keeps his legs all right then he put the blades on oh youre in trouble missy i tell you i go to my gun safe she locked herself in the bathroom he shot her through the bathroom door seems like overkill doesnt it bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them but oscars one of the few men on earth that couldnt kick the door in right he was wearing the blades so boing ah so i think oscar will probably go to prison now in south africa one in four people have aids i assume it may even be worse in the prison population now can i say this look ive never raped a man i hate that i have to put a man in that sentence but whatever ive never raped a man but if i was going to rape a man it would be a legless olympian cause in prison its all about getting one up on other people and making people think youre tough and all that like you want to fucking rape me i just raped an olympian bitch is that what you fucking want thered be a wonderful moment when youre in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a terminator movie  you know what i like about that joke so often when you tell a joke the rapist is the villain in the story but not in that one not in that one hes the hero all right we have to get going soon before i leave \\u2013 i thank you very much for coming \\u2013  no i said soon not over its just soon you cunts so calm down   i always i always find that weird when someone like whistles like that what do they think is going to happen like im going to go fucking you know me mate i was enjoying claps and cheers but what i needed was a highpitched squeal noise thank god you came along to pick up my spirits  love you all right final story now i was in south africa again jeez i dont think ill be working in south africa after this special comes out i used to do like one tour in south africa every year and i just dont know if ill be invited this time theyll be like  we dont like him hes no good anyway so im in south africa and i had to fly back from cape town to los angeles which is like a  flight youve to go up to london and go across cunt of a trip um but it was all right cause i had a business class ticket so i didnt give a fuck and when i travel economy i try to dress up nice cause i like to look good in case someone recognizes me and i might get an upgrade but when ive already got a business class ticket i try to look like a bag of shit cause its important to me that everyone else in business class doesnt want me there and theyre annoyed by my presence so im wearing a white tshirt thats got brown stains on it with a hole in the side im wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out so anyway i go up to the counter up to the business thing with the thing and i go hello and the lady goes  oh mr jefferies im so sorry but you have been downgraded i said you what now she goes business class is full you have been downgraded and i said i understand that business class is full i bought one of the tickets that

minutes but thank you everybody so much for coming um its a very exciting day for me its been a very exciting year for me i turned  this year yes thank you five people i appreciate that uh i can tell that im getting older because now when i see an  girl my automatic thought is fuck you fuck you i dont even know you but fuck you cause im straight up jealous im jealous first and foremost of their metabolism because  girls they could just eat like shit and then they take a shit and have a sixpack right they got thatthat beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and theres that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through and then when they go to sleep they just go to sleep right they dont have insomnia yet they dont know what its like to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind they have their whole lives ahead of them they dont have hpv yet they just go to sleep in peace at night everybody has hpv ok everybody has it its ok come out already everybody has it if you dont have it yet you go and get it you go and get it its coming you dont have hpv yet youre a fucking loser all right thats what that says about you a lot of men dont know that they have hpv because its undetectable in men its really fucked up hpv is a ghost that lives inside mens bodies and says boo in womens bodies my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv either i have the kind thats gonna turn into cervical cancer or i have the kind where my body will heal itself very helpful this doctor right so basically either im gonna die or youre in the presence of wolverine bitches well find out um i can also tell that im getting older because my kindle is turning into a selfhelp library im not interested in books like fifty shades of grey ok im interested in the lifechanging magic of tidying up yes yes thats right how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success thats what your  is all about how can i turn this shit around im a horrible person im not happy with where i am how can i turn this shit around help me tony robbins help mei have a hoarding problem which im hoping is the center of all of my other problems im hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictators gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade cause it might come in handy as a shovel when youre busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communiststhe last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit dont ever do that with your mom it was like the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments  manual the manual she dont even know where the calculator is those of you under  probably dont know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost like  and everybody thought it was like this judy jetsons laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was like the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like you never know when you might need this and i was like but i do know that im gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die and im not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah thats not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success i grew up a lot this past year uh this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really im the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen theyre sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and uh hes\\u2013 hes much better looking than me hes way out of my league and i saw him and i was like oh my god who is that and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was like oh my god im gonna trap his ass going to trap his ass and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was like all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden when really its a public park that has hosted many reggae fests and has even accidentally let two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had like we had we had so much chemistry he was like hey wassup i was like wassup and we\\u2013 the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was like hey can you drop me off i was like where he was like at the park and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was like oh no i just fucked a homeless dude again my husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who like you know wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they like to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory its too much i dont know whats wrong with these bitches i get it you know because being with a white dude you feel very you feel very picturesque when youre with a white dude you know you feel like youre in a wes anderson movie or something and you know white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff like that and its very you know its hot hookin up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel like im absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement you know just right there through the money hole and just and then also hes so vulnerable down there im like i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer you know but i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home and be racist together you get to say whatever you like you dont gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese im halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people its amazing its what love is built on you know my last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was like hold it you guys arent mexican asianamerican men are very underrated i dont know why people dont go for them theyre the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down its like making love to a dolphin oh my god its so smooth just like a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night you know oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards its all red and inflamed and youre like i did not ask to be exfoliated today this is the last time i go on jdate more like loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi and then asian men no body odor none they just smell like responsibility thats where the umami flavor comes from i think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding uh between each other because hes halffilipino and halfjapanese and im halfchinese and halfvietnamese so were both halffancy asian and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things like host olympics jungle asians host diseases its its different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse uh you know learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up like filipino carlton ok so he didnt know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was like its authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp i was like its not authentic ok you can tell first and foremost by the name cause it dont got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused i grew up going to private school too him and i are both total like private school asians we both are big hippies too we like to backpack through southeast asia we like to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats thats right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit like that uh we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes like freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread thats like a thousand percent of your daily fiber and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so its funny right because hes asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of asian people like we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall and neither of us know what the fuck they mean were like oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house him and i had been dating for four years and i\\u2013 i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose because i had been pressuring him to do it so you know i just had this wacky womens intuition thats how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the mans head first passively and then if he doesnt get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because you know that youre too old and its too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so youre like im just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like shut the fuck up fine will you marry me and then afterwards the woman is always like oh my god he proposed it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page hes probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread thats how rotten i was people are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband im a completely different person you\\u2013 like you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him im very soft and like very nurturing and very domestic weve been together now for five years and for five years ive packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that hed become dependent on me cause he graduated from harvard business school and i dont wanna work anymore i dont i straight up dont wanna work anymore i dont feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future cause i dont wanna work anymore ive been reading that book by sheryl sandberg shes the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i dont wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like were dumb women we dont know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen cause were too stupid to have any real responsibility and then all these women had to show off and be like we could do it we could do anything bitch shut up dont tell them the secret they ruined it for us and now were expected to work when i hear the phrase doubleincome household i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and theyre like but ali we have so many more options now oh you dont think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it a lot of my friends when we walk around together theyll get very judgmental about housewives that well see on the street and theyll be like look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants im like that bitch is a genius shes not a housewife shes retired i do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is its a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers its a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs its probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they dont gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they dont gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they dont gotta ten times a day every day like youre about to eat a sadass meal they dont gotta do that they dont gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper thats not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole its basically like wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed cause youre paranoid that your coworkers gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and youre like oh no courtneys listening shes waiting shes timing me and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks like its been run over by the goonies housewives they dont gotta muffle their shit too they dont gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they dont gotta try to you know squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they dont gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they want you know its\\u2013 its very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say you need to get to work on time i was like you need to eat bananas i saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you dont try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit together my fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently um and he was like hey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had i was like why you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that dont your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said i do what i really meant was oh im done im done i dont wanna work anymore and im not dieting anymore since i got married last year ive been eating fried chicken skin every day since thats right and just fulfilling my destiny which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes like mrs pacman just lets redecorate i gave up a lot of myself when i got married im a\\u2013 im a disgusting pervert im a pervert im a gross filthy animal and i think its because i started watching porn at a very young age and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that yyou get sicker and sicker and sicker the images you crave get sicker and sicker and sicker but its ok because the internet will always catch up to you i broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back i was like uh youre a idiot dude do you realize that if i went on craigslist and posted tiny asian female seeking anal the internet would crash and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode they would explode a lot of women get really you know freaked out about anal and theyre like oh i dont wanna do that im scared of\\u2013 of the pain you aint scared of the pain women they wax their eyebrows they do all sorts of crazy shit youre not scared of the pain what youre really scared of is doo doo on the dick youre scared that hes gonna see that and thats gonna be all of your shame your inner evil all your secrets and lies sephora cant help you now but dont worry cause when he puts it in the butt all hes thinking about is i just put it in her butt i gotta go call my mom my dad dave my grandma youre\\u2013 if youre married youre gonna have to do anal eventually ok you have to because you gotta change it up you gotta change it up so that you dont cheat on each other you gotta keep it interesting if you put it in different holes maybe youll feel like youre fucking different people i was very sexually active in my  and as a result im a little bit stretched out down there ok so when i finally did anal i just felt like i got a second chance at life you know i was like oh my god its like im going back in time \\u266a a whole new world \\u266a it was magical a big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate yeah like a conqueror i just wanted to now if you havent done it before ladies go home and treat yourself do it tonight you only live once yolo just sneak your\\u2013 just give your man a little\\u2013 a little pushpush in the tushtush just give him a little atari you know and youll get a lot of resistance from the man at first youll get a lot of no no no no please no really i dont\\u2013 no i dont i dont no they get all squirmy wormy because theyre scared theyre scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed and they like it that then it might mean that theyre gay and i like that fear that shit turns me on you know especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure oh my god and you just see the look in the mans eye like hes discovered nirvana and its like youre the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole and then you as the woman in his eyes just become the lord of the rim you know my husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me when\\u2013 when ive asked him to spank me this is what he does hey hey are you ok are you all right you know i respect you right im like yes i know you respect me and thats why you need to abuse me ok cause its the most strongheaded loudmouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed women who are ceos they just wanna be roughed around they just want their\\u2013 glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 its because were so in control all the time that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control you know like i dont wanna die dont kill me i dont wanna die but i also dont want to be sure that im gonna live you know i just wanna be out of control for once just\\u2013 just choke me enough so that i cant talk cause if i can talk im gonna tell you what to do and im tired of being the boss im the boss all the time so in the bedroom you be the boss yes because im the real boss and i told you so motherfucker so do it sheryl sandberg that woman who wrote lean in has had such a big impact that now because of her there is a ban on the word bossy in elementary schools because according to her its sexist to use the word bossy because boys are never called bossy so now instead of saying youre bossy youre supposed to say you have executive leadership skills which is a very roundabout way of saying youre a little cunt im just waiting for the right moment to like become a housewife financially you know i want my husband to get us to like a certain point financially i wanna get to the point as a couple where i can comfortably afford sliced mango know what im talking about im talking about that whole foods mango that  whole foods mango that was sliced by white people thats the kind of income bracket im striving for thats when you know youve made it when youre eating mango that was sliced by a dude named noah i want noah mango rebecca kiwi danielle pineapple you know what else i want i wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk see a quarter and just keep on walking like a princess i have some useful advice for all my asianamerican brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteran so i dont know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah its very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics dont get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you theres\\u2013 none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear thats not the case with male comics once they have a baby theyll get up on stage a week afterwards and theyll be like guys i just had this fucking baby that babys a little piece of shit its so annoying and boring and all these other shitty dads in the audience are like thats hilarious i identify and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper cause her pussy needs to heal from the babys head shredding it up shes busy so i dont know whats gonna happen to me you know a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were like ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become\\u2013 youre gonna disappear and youre gonna become some lame stayathome mom i was like yeah thats the dream thats the point this is the ultimate trap i won you know another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were like why are you gonna have a kid why dont you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached i was like yeah thats cool until my husband dies which hes definitely gonna before me because im a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until im a billion im guaranteed like a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase black dont crack well asian dont die we dont die especially the women we live forever and you know why were such bad drivers because were trying to die were like yeah let me see how invincible i really am imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely im gonna make a right turn\\u2013 i changed my mind its a uturn i changed my mind again its a oturn every time i get into a car accident im like oh my god not again i need to hide my face so that everybody doesnt see that its what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess theres this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood theres multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i dont know whats wrong with me but im still here you know i need to have children to keep me company when i get older its lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis cause she knows that shes got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead im just kidding she doesnt have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when im older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isnt around to support me anymore im not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living thats not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they dont give a fuck they got no shame theyre like im just gonna recycle go bald go to the park do this shit they do that cause its a free activity for them they do it in their\\u2013 their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see whos gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are like the tupac and biggie of longevity i also decided to have a kid because uh im only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it\\u2013 and it scared me like im only  and my pussy is not as wet as it used to be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbusters i dont know what kind of mother im gonna be im\\u2013 im  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b like skittles so my uterus probably looked like a smokers lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act like everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich uh mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious to protect you cause you gotta check that its all good in the hood if its too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmd when my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were like oh my god thats so hot you guys doin a lot of fuckin no dude thats\\u2013 thats shit you do in your  ok when in\\u2013 when youre in your  and youve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was like only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be like were not fuckin i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out its like release the kraken and they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship you know and um yeah and most of the time like we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and id be like ok its go time and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesnt have to see the expression on my face that says please hurry the fuck up and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look like they just got bit by a zombie just and then because were hippies id be like hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymore im very grateful to be pregnant and to be this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that theyre like oh my god thats so dark and terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage its super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom\\u2013 shes from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was like uh yeah where im from thats like losing a pair of shoes its whatevs ok and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins and i was like no and then she said but what i dont see is a heartbeat and i was like yes the lord is mysterious dont feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was like you look you watch the whole thing and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyonc\\u00e9 he bought me a bike off of craigslist thats my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wanted im scared about giving childbirth though im\\u2013 im very very scared of childbirth thats why im going to hire a doula you know what that is you know what a doula is thats a white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser s\\u00f6ze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did you know that youre gonna poop on the table i was like yeah i look forward to it im all backed up from holding in my shit at work i cant wait to cleanse it makes sense like that you\\u2013 that that happens because when youre in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think thats enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay thats the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasnt even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house hey can you wash the dishes no can you water the plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin a eyeball ok are you makin a foot i didnt think so you change the channel i can already see how theres like this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes to all your doctors appointments he is so supportive guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me im the star of the show theres nothing for the camera to see if im not there but hes the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im a bad mommy you know i\\u2013 i\\u2013 i like i berate my husband on like a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis to keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy of another womans affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant you know your nipples get huge and dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that the baby can see like a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then you know they get big\\u2013 they get big like fingers like you you you owe me money you my nipples look like whoppers now and naked i look like a minion but im not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing it now that im seven and a half months pregnant my pussys all wet again but its different its not like when i was  years old when it was like really hot you know and i was like why is it different and i looked it up and my pussys all wet again because my\\u2013 my bodys secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it thats not the same when its straight up soldier glue when its neosporin so you know i\\u2013 i in\\u2013 previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy whos like way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and uh two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out hes the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enrond my ass and now if i dont work we die why else do you think im performing seven and a half months pregnant all right ive been ali wong have a good night everybody thank you your email address will not be published

five years ago pretty much everyone who i know started to get married and that was strange for me because i dont really believe in the idea of marriage and that would have been fine except i have a problem where sometimes when i think that i am right about something it can be a real source of tension between me and the person im arguing with and the reason its a source of tension is that im right and so i remember distinctly talking to my friend dana and she goes well you dont believe in marriage for you but of course you believe in it for other people and i was like no i think its insane you know for anyone and she said whyand i said well first of all it just seems doomed you know  of marriages end in divorce thats just first marriages by the way second marriages  to  end in divorce third marriages  to  end in divorce thats a learning curvesecond of all monogamys impossible or at the very least not a sure thing when i say that i think people assume that im implying that men are incapable of being faithful i think women are just as incapable but for more sophisticated reasons you know i mean with men were just really simple we have a very simple sexuality when i say that my female friends are like well we like sex just as much as you do and i said sure but its different and they say how and i say have you ever masturbated while driving a carnumber three im never gonna be happy why would anyone want to be a part of that i think thats not brought up often enough i um i didnt know that would be the reaction oh no thats the hopeful part the uh i had one ally in all this which is my friend andy and hes a comedian as well not only did we decide we werent gonna get married we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married yeah we were pretty good at it like we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages you know we were we were pretty good i mean we werent like the best in the world im sure there are better in europe but we were we were solid you know like so like for example at point my friend alex was about to get engaged and so we just took him to dinner and during dessert we gave him a long hard stare we said are you sure this is what you want to do and then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we werent friends anymore so february   im at andys house in los angeles and earlier in the night i got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone and it was a bad one because i knew that i was right and andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation cause hes the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether youre right he says stuff like she sounds crazy like even if what shes saying isnt that crazy like youd be like she only eats whole wheat bagels hed be like she sounds crazy youd be like thats not even the crazy part you know so im telling him about his argument and he goes youre right i go i know im right he goes yeah youre right i go i know im right i got to tell her about this in the morning and i get in my rental car to head back to my hotel and im driving out of andys small road and im tboned i dont know if youre familiar with this term uh this is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car drivers side at a  angle like a tbone steak and in   seconds im spun around and i think im dead no wait im paralyzed and then i hear nothing and then i hear the other car skid out and drive away i know let me tell you how this argument started i met jenny in st louis my friend andy and i were working for her company they were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches which is really my demographic i uh no i was very nervous about this i was actually kind of about to go onstage and i was like scrawling notes on my napkin a lot of times ill write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary and jenny looked at me and she goes what are you doing and i said im writing my set list and then she goes i think itll be fine and i was like no it wont be fine and then she was like i think it will be okay and i said why do you think that and she said well you look so nervous i think theyll feel sorry for you but jenny has this really soft sweet voice like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything at one point she said it seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage normally id be offended by that but in this instance i was like you are right that is a great point you are beautiful you know she re she really was you know from the moment i met jenny i knew i wanted to sleep with her at least once stay with me uh i mean i mean that in like in the most meaningful way like that was the most that i was capable of in my life at that point i id jus id just come off a really long difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married and and then we werent and then when we werent i was so heartbroken i just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely you know and but from the moment i met jenny i just wanted to be with her and i didnt i didnt think it was gonna happen like i dont have that kind of confidence i actually think of myself as a sex maybe which is to say that if im seeing a girl shed think id have sex with him maybe you know and im im not ashamed of that there were periods in my life where i was a sex never or a sex with self always yeah and often surprisingly often yeah i just dont give off a great first impression like ill give you an example like this is the shirt i decided to wear tonight like i didnt i didnt spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt i mean this is my a outfit my b outfit was naked i like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that i might be a fixerupper ive reached this point in my life i dont really look in the mirror before i leave my apartment i glance at it to make sure im not bleeding you know what i mean like but i dont stare at the mirror if i stare at the mirror i get angry like i feel like im complaining about a bad call a ref just made im like come on youre blind if youre leaving the house like that and the ref is god and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline and its a close game cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast and im all riled up im about to charge the field and the guy comes by with fried dough and im like next time you know thats how i go for fried dough cause i have a problem i just this is ridiculous can you follow me over here for a second im gonna jump off stage this is only in seattle where someone is wearing no shoes no shoes or socks what who are you people what is wrong with you i would expect that behavior from this guy but not you sir not you what is this where do you think you are from seattle yeah seattle so ive been going uh recently to a womens exercise class iive given up on having a traditional male physique and so now im going for strong independent woman and uh its going pretty well you know im not as good in the class as you might think sometimes ill kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isnt looking but then when she looks over i always have to strike a pose as though ive been doing what everybody else has been doing it reminds me of the olympics you know how they do gymnastics how theyll have those the girls will do those crazy flips and twirls and every once in a while and im not saying i root for this to happen but sometimes theyll fall and its ugly cause theyre rolling around like im in a lot of trouble like i dont even know how i got here but at the end of that no matter what and i totally fall for it im like that cant possibly be the same loser from moments ago i mean thats a completely different person this person has much better posture for starters i really wanted jenny to come out with me and andy that night in st louis cause we were going out to one of these famous irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak and so i thought that might work to my advantage i dont know and uh i didnt have the nerve to ask her myself and so i convinced andy to ask her for us and uh pfft which yeah i dont know if that was the best idea cause uh were heading were in the car heading to the pub and jenny says oh i left my id at the hotel and i was like oh we can just swing back and get it and shes like shes like no itll be fine i was like no it wont be fine cause its st patricks day and theres bouncers and she goes no itll be okay and i was like no it wont be okay and then we get to the pub and it was fine like the bouncer just kind of waved her through which has not been my experience with bouncers for me bouncers are like prison guards and for jenny theyre like birthday clowns like you know what can i do to make your day betteryou know and thats were at the pub and it had taken so much convincing for andy to get jenny to come out there by the time she came out she thought she was on a date with him and yeah that wasnt the idea and so i said i had to convince him to fall away as the night went on like the red rockets on the space shuttle and eventually she realized she was on a date with me and she was not happy about that but uh but she warmed to me as the night went on cause she was drinking and then like no by the end of the night we were laughing and having a good time and we i caught a break which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends and she and i were stuffed in this little back seat together and it was really quiet so i could hear her soft voice and she told me she had just come off a long difficult breakup and i told her about my breakup and for a moment there in the back seat it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart and we get back to the hotel and i offer to walk her to her room and she says sure we get to her door and i didnt want this night to end and so i build up the courage to lean in to kiss her and she says oh no thank you which i thought was polite but disappointing i mean theres something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because youre really putting yourself out there youre just like i think we should connect mouths you know and the other persons like i do not think we should connect mouths and those are theyre two very different mouth agendas you know and then you just feel so stupid youre like i never should have suggested we connect mouths you know this is a sore subject for me i have sort of a long history of failed kisses like i i remember growing up like when people started making out like in my time in massachusetts it was in seventh grade i remember i remember it like it was yesterday cause i was shocked i was like people we know are just making out with other people we know but how you know it seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden i was like i am not doing that and collectively all the girls in my class were like that is fine you are not on the list youre not exactly a firstround draft pick for our new activity i was like perfect it seemed so gross to me and it still does kind of like sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like i dont like when i see two dudes making out in the street and i feel that way about anyone like making out is just sloppy its like watching a dog eat spaghetti thats how i make out is that right does anybody know if thats right okay good so in seventh grade i was like im not gonna make out with anybody and that was fine for a while but increasingly it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts it was like the makeout club and the nonmakeout club and these were informal organizations of course i mean i would be sad if that were schoolsanctioned like we call this meeting of the nonmakeout club to order first order of business nintendo second order of business why doesnt anyone like us meeting adjourned i dont know it was a sad group and we were losing good guys by the day i feared i feared that soon i would be the lone member of the nonmakeout club so i was like i got to try to get into the makeout club but it was a very intangible goal i didnt really talk to a lot of girls and there was one girl who sat in front of me in class named lisa bazetti who i had a huge crush on but she was way out of my league like she had many suitors she had i dont the rest of the show is in old english uh she doth had many suitors uh no she had many you know admirers and there were three of us really and i was in third place in all the trade publications but i had one advantage over these other guys which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework thanks to alphabetical order bazetti birbiglia one time i said something on the phone that made her laugh and i was like oh this is great i got to do that more and one time we were on the phone and she was laughing so hard i remember so well cause she goes mike you got to stop im gonna pee myself and i was like wow this was the closest id ever come to a vagina so spent the next  years trying to get lisa bazetti to pee and thats how i ended up here yeah thats how we all ended up here in a sense so uh so heres what happened with lisa one time i built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me and she said yes i couldnt believe it like all of a sudden i thought well maybe this will be like one of those romantic comedy montages well go to the carnival well get stuck on the top of the ferris wheel well make out itll all take a minute and a half and it will be set to phil collins song but i think that when youre  years old you just dont understand certain things about your digestive system you dont know that you shouldnt eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler cotton candy being the most insane of these items its basically saying were gonna take sugar which everyone knows is bad but then well dress it up like insulation and im like im not sure what the selling point is there is it the sugar or the insulation theyre like we already sold it im like well done way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates i dont know if you have the scrambler here in seattle i imagine you might it travels on a truck it is a very mobile scrambling unit the premise is very simple you just sit on a twoperson pod with the person you are in love with and that pod goes in a circle which is part of a larger circle which is part of an even grander circle as i understand it it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients it was called the shits of pantserator and it was wildly successful and then it was coopted by the carnival workers of america cwoa and they said they said we like it but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff and then one guy says well what about the i think im gonna dieerator and theyre like thats good cause it gets across the essence of how you feel when youre on the machine plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea which is a nice homage to the original intention of the machine but we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff and then one guy goes well what about the scrambler cause it scrambles you theyre like we get it frank but who frank is a maniac this guy cant be stopped but every once in a while hes got a good idea but who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment and this one guy goes well i have a nephew whos  years old and smokes pot  hours a day i feel like he might be available and theyre like he sounds amazing we dont even need to interview him he sounds completely qualifiedi sit down with lisa on the scrambler and im feeling good like shes snuggling up close to me and im thinking im thinking like this could be it this could be where its all gonna happen this is very special and then they put that bar seat belt down and the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment its not a ralph nader approved item i dont think its saved lives i think the only thing its ever done is in a scrambler accident its just sort of held someones esophagus down to the pavement making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident first rule of scrambler accident dont talk about scrambler accident thats from scrambler club well i knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that i was going to throw up for sure and i even said to the  stoner i was like hey actually and then he was gone apparently he doesnt enjoy the second halves of sentencesso then im scrambling and as i am scrambling im thinking i need to come up with a plan of some kind im not going down without a fight my first plan was very simple it was just dont look at lisa dont look at any other people i was like dont look at lisa dont look at any other people dont look at lisa dont look at any other people i need a new plan and the new plan was i needed to tell the scrambler operator that he needed to stop the ride but the mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window so im like i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride please stop the ride and im back im not sure he heard me i got to say it louder please stop the ride im not sure hes paying attention i think he might be smoking pot right now the third time i said please stop and then i started throwing up and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler just popcorn peanuts insulation really insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa i did not look at lisa but im pretty sure she was staring at me because i was a spectacle at that point i was spectacular and we did not make out i did not lose my mouth virginity that evening two years later it gets worse um im at the st johns high school what they call a cattle call dance this is an all boys catholic school i attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty st johns gymnasium like cattle which is a friendly way to describe women you know so cattle shows up at  well make out with the cattle cattle goes home at  then we go out for burgers completely separate from the cattle analogy it was a horrible affair it was just like this room chockfull of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out at this point i was indeed the lone member of the nonmakeout club but it was actually worse than that cause i had to lie to my friends and tell them i had had my first kiss cause it was like this really tough all boys school and so when they would ask like oh have you had your first kiss id be like yeah like all the time like every every week i always feared at some point thered be a followup question like oh yeah whats it like and id be like yeah you know its just like licking an ice cream cone and theyd be like no its not its like sucking on a rocket pop and id be like ah wrong frozen dessert analogy im at the dance and im flanked by my friend sam ricciardi and were introduced by our friend tom to these girls from his town they were the last two cows at the dance they were like moo and we were like moo and then sam says one of these phrases i think weve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat he says you get that one which i know its the worst turn of phrase but im comfortable saying it cause i know ive been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me you get that one and then her friend goes like oof you know or even worse or even worse like you owe me which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance i would hate to hurt someones credit score you know so he goes he goes you get that one and then im just fast dancing with this girl sandra to young mcs bust a move and im not great at fast dancing but they had the strobe light going so its only catching me one out of every five hey so shes losing interest but at  the speed and then im saved by a slow song stairway to heaven which is a classic makeout anthem led zeppelin eight minutes long whats great about slow dancing is you cant really mess it up cause its just sort of a slowmotion hug like the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it shed be like what are you doing and id be like i dont pick up on social cues you know but its such a long song you know stairway so im just trying not to fidget im sort of a fidgety person i feared if i fidgeted too much i might initiate the head tilt too early i didnt know anything about making out but id seen people do it i could see theres like a head tilt i had heard there were tongues involved and i could see that there was like some kind of space in between the two mouths to me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing what is happening in that space there is no you know theres no video documentation of that area its like the giant squid of making out no one has seen it alive theyve only seen it washed up on the shore which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy but so im trying not to fidget then with   minutes left in stairway to heaven the song hits that crescendo all around me kids start to make the tilt just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me and i was like oh no i dont want to be alone anymore and i make the slightest tilt and then sandra comes in strong and then its an allout mouth war and she had artillery cause she had braces it was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork as this oral atrocity is taking place all i can think is im not alone anymore im not in the nonmakeout club and all i wanted to do was tell my friends but i couldnt because up until that point id lied and said that id had my first kiss i walked off the dance floor sam was like howd it go dude i had to be like same as always pretty smooth as the week wore on i started to convince myself well maybe it did go well and i should call sandra and this could bud into a relationship of some kind but i got her number from tom and those conversations ended up being very brief you know we didnt have a lot to talk about i remember just being like hey you like full house me neither cool all right later you know what i mean at certain points i remember getting this vibe from her kind of like why are you calling me and i remember thinking oh im probably reading into that one too much and and then she stopped calling me back and i was like oh yeah i read into that one perfectly but i just felt so dumb about the whole thing and the worst part is i couldnt even tell my friends until one day i was i was standing by my locker with my friend tom and so i said to him i was like hey whats going on with sandra like she hasnt called me back and tom has this knowing grin on his face i was like what tom was like nothing and i was like what tom was like nothing and i was like what toms like oh i talked to sandra and she said youre the worst kisser shes ever kissed and it was so devastating cause not only was it probably true but i couldnt explain to my friends why it was true i couldnt say that makes sense ive never done that before so instead i had to play it off i had to be like yeah that sounds about right im a terrible kisser thats kind of my thing so i lean in to kiss jenny and she says oh no thank you she agrees to go out with me in new york we were both living in new york and she gave me her number and i typed it in my phone and from that point on she would be jen irish pub nice a few weeks later i took her out to a restaurant i couldnt afford to show her how much money i could put on my credit card were out to dinner and she says to me she goes everyone hates me at work and i said why would they hate you i love you she goes you love me i go i mean you seem cool i pulled it back i didnt want to show all my cards just about nine of them one of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said you know sometimes ill date two people at once and that way im never let down by either person i said that seems like a really smart plan like id like to do that as well and she said im still kind of seeing my exboyfriend john and you can see other people too but you have to tell me if youre seeing them and i was like all right sounds like a plan got it break i got to go find some more people you know and so a few nights later im in another city and i do a show and after the show i went out to a bar and i ended up making out with this random girl then a few nights later im out to dinner with jenny and she says how was your trip and i said it was great i did some shows and then one night i ended up making out with this random girl and that didnt go over very well in the conversation i could sense that something was wrong and i was like but im right about that right like im supposed to tell you if that happens right and she says yeah but it doesnt mean that i wont lose interest in you and i said thats a whole new clause thats a twist what is this the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects i said are you still seeing john and she said sometimes i said well dont you see the contradiction in that and she says yes and it gets very quiet because we were falling in love three weeks into my relationship with jenny i built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to bermuda i wanted to show her how much more money i could put on my credit card since i didnt have a lot left we went to bermuda cause it was the off season you can get these great deals online because as it turns out when its winter in new york it is also winter in bermuda and uh jenny and i meet up at the airport and shes late which is a big pet peeve of mine i fancy myself as a professional traveler im always two hours early i have my pocket for my ticket and my passport and i have laceless moccasins i never tell jokes about bombs and and jennys late and then we get to security and im not making this up she doesnt have a license or a passport and i said what do you mean i go how do you travel and she goes well usually they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work id i dont like to dwell on the differences between men and women but i just cant imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport and they would let him on the plane but women get a pass on things like this that i find completely bewildering i mean if i were in charge of alqaeda for example what what i would do is i would recruit attractive women because theyre just not stopped under any circumstances although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the  virgins and you know the women wouldnt want that unless theyre lesbians although theres an idea you know alqaeda alqaeda could recruit hot lesbians although then theyd have to guarantee that the  virgins are also lesbians i mean what are the odds you know all  virgins are also lesbians unless you think of sexuality as like a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity like the  virgins are like i didnt even know i was a lesbian until i had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist and now thats all im into i used to be into these afghani guys who are so crazy theyd die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me and  of my friends but now i dont see khalid in the same way anymore the point is we went to bermuda and were on the flight on the flight and the flight attendant comes over and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us and she says congratulations on your honeymoon and we said oh no thanks were not on our honeymoon and she walks away and jenny says thats so funny i dont think ill ever go on a honeymoon and i said oh really and she goes yeah i dont think id ever want to get married in my life and i said oh really i go me too i said is that based on a principle or did you have a bad relationship like what was your first boyfriend like and she told me about her first boyfriend brian it was they were at the same bus stop when they were  and they would make out on the bus and they were together for six years and they you know their relationship got deeper and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together and i said then what and she said he died he had leukemia and i said well do you ever talk about this with anyone and she says no i dont really like to talk about it but these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where jenny was opening up to me and i was opening up to her and every night wed be up till  or  in the morning and we were so happy we at one point i was like well we should do this again we should go on another trip and you could get a license or a passport jenny said that sounds great but i dont think id get a license or a passport cause they dont make me get one and i was like yeah but its the law you know jenny says yeah i dont think ill get one cause they dont make me get one you know thats how i feel thats how jenny argues things sometimes shell just say thats how i feel and ill say thats not an argument like were not even in an argument right now because you dont have an argument and shell say i just won that argument and ill say thats not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is and shell say i just won that argument again thats how i feel you could see how this could be a little bit maddening you know uh on our final day on the trip we got into an argument about essentially nothing she noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel and she said we should play and i was like yeah but not like a game and she said why and i said well cause id win and she said no i think i would win i go no i know that id win and i know that what im supposed to say is that the guy says ill win the girl says ill win and the guy lets her win and then she likes him more but i just dont have that in me and jenny goes you dont have to let me win lets go out and play and so we went out and played basketball and i just kicked her ass i mean it was just like it was just like  to  you know  to  i mean i was having a good day but still i was just destroying her and at one point she literally said ive never met someone whos so obsessed with the score and i said the score is what makes it a game so were arguing this over lunch and then again it comes up at dinner and then were still arguing about it at  or  in the morning about essentially nothing and she said i dont understand why youre so obsessed with being right i go im not obsessed with it i just am i said why do you think youre right and she says thats how i feel i said if you think im so wrong about everything why are you even with me and jenny says you cant choose who you love which is true but it doesnt mean its good i remember the first time i fell in love i was in high school and it was that first time where you fall in love and youre just like this is it i found her im  years old and im done you know and her name was amanda and she was like adorable and funny and what was really exciting for me was that she was like a delinquent like i was like this playbytherules school citizen and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid which i thought was a really strong quality like at one point she was like it was totally messed up because it wasnt even me it was this other girl and i was framed and i was just like awesome like no one would ever frame me for anything i just i thought it was like an opposites attract situation she wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper and i wanted to know what it was like to be cool at one point i was like do you want to write an article for the newspaper she goes i dont want to write an article i want to do things people write articles about and i was like good answeri find that when you fall in love you tend to overlook certain red flags one of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me but then she would pull it back shed be like no one likes you at all only kidding or like youre like a nerd but youre not even smart just joking cant choose who you lovesecond red flag with amanda was that she was a liar and i dont i dont mean that in an offensive way like lying was kind of like a its like a sport at the school i was at i transferred from the all boys school to this coed school there was this one guy in my class named keith robbins who was a legendary liar youd know when he was lying cause he would lick his finger like a bookie and he would dart his eyes from side to side and hed go yeah yeah nice nice you know and he wasnt even handling money like i dont even know what this is about and then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant hed be like yeah my uncles tony robbins motivational speaker yeah nice you know and we found out that that wasnt even true but even if that were true that wouldnt be impressive to a bunch of high school students but i think thats the jedi level of lying is you lie about little stuff and no one notices when youre lying about big stuff its like bankingthe final red flag with amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend i know im in the future also i think we can all see now cause were so smart and mikes so dumb and uh you know i can also see in retrospect thats a much bigger red flag than i perceived it to be at the time but i was so excited she was even with me at all and she said she had another boyfriend at home but they were in the process of breaking up but it was a bad time cause his parents were sick and so i tried to be understanding of that you know i went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents and i thought well this is the affirmation that i need im gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend and i drive my moms station wagon to amandas parents house and i walk in the front door and theres amanda and theres her parents and its going well and a few hours go by and this other guy comes over to the house and his name is scott im assuming hes like a family friend or a relative and slowly im noticing similarities between scott and things that amanda has said about her other boyfriend theyre both in their first year in college and theyre competitive wrestlers and its dawning on me that im hanging out with my girlfriends boyfriend and its going pretty well i mean he he seemed like a nice guy i could totally see what she saw in him there was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom she would hold on to my hand and she would say i wish it were just you and me here and i remember thinking you could make that happen the way she said it was as though she werent involved in the decision process like id love to but the boys in corporatewell the day took an even stranger turn when scott suggested that we go hang out at his house and i met his parents it is indescribable meeting your girlfriends boyfriends parents for the first time part of you is angry for obvious reasons but then part of you still wants to make a good impression you know youre like maybe if this goes well shell see that im good with adults in general as a side note his parents seemed in perfect health at one point his dad even said to me how do you know amanda and i said were just friends from school and i was so ashamed and i felt so dumb and i drove home and i remember thinking i am never gonna let this happen to me again so ten months into my relationship with jenny she invites me to meet her parents and this was a tricky time at this point our relationship was intense but casual which is a dangerous relationship cocktail and it was a hard thing to organize cause i was away probably five days out of the week and so we found a sunday where i was coming back from a fiveday stint in texas which was awful cause it was in texas and i thats thats not to say i dislike texas entirely its such a large thing to dislike and uh but that week it felt like texas just disliked me and i just kind of disliked texas back to the point where i developed a small drinking problem which is which is very popular in texas i was performing at a comedy club now comedy i love comedy clubs cause theyre sort of a highlow entertainment proposition like in some ways though theyre the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word and then some of them sell dildo straws you know like theres  bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends and theyre handing out gummy penises or whatever thats thats actually a thing i didnt even realize that i didnt realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was was the gummy quality of the penis i feel like if i were in charge of the candification of the penis it would be hard candy and then if and then if you suck it down to the gummy part then you just sort of put that off to the side but i but thats thats not my job im you know i leave that to the experts but i just i just do the comedy part but i was performing at this club all week and after the late show saturday night i was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things and id been drinking all week and uh i always try to be a team player you know so i was like whatever i can do to help i dont see how this could end badly and uh the next morning i wake up in the my hotel room and im hung over and im groggy and i roll out of bed and i run to the airport to catch my flight im still two hours early and i land in new york and i get a cab to jennys parents house and i walk in the front door and theres jenny and theres her parents and theres her other sort of exboyfriend john and he wasnt front and center like he was just kind of around like he was in the pool like wading and doing laps like that kind of thing but i pulled jenny aside i was like well whats john doing here and she says well he and i arent still together but when we were together he became friends with my stepdad and hes been staying here at their house the last couple weeks and i said you know thats not good i feel like that gives him the edge jennys staring at me and i said what she says you have a hickey on your neck and i said i dont think thats true and then i glance at the mirror next to me and realize that in fact i do have a hickey on my neck and i say im really sorry and she says where is that from and i said there was this bachelorette party and i was drunk that sentence never comes out right i mean theres no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay and we start arguing and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment i didnt have a leg to stand on i was like well what about john what was he doing there she said you have a hickey on your neck i said yeah but at least i told you the truth and she said eventually and i said eventually is better than never and then she kneed me in the balls i dont know if youve ever experienced this before im sure half of you have not uh its like being electrocuted except you dont get to die its like you want to die but you cant and theres a person in your face saying you deserve this which they wouldnt even do in electrocutions i think they would deem that as inhumane\\u00a0 even in texasjenny says i think that we should just break up you know its not just this i mean youre away a lot of the time and even when youre here you work at night and i work in the day i just dont think its gonna work out and i said okay\\u00a0 and we were apart for about six months and i missed her so much but i kept resisting calling her cause i wanted to give her space and every once in a while id get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from jen irish pub nice and it would just say hi and id write back hi it was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another but i think in some ways kept us together and finally on new years i caved in and i called her i said hey i really miss you and i want to see you and we got together for coffee and we hit it off just like we used to and we decided we would get back together we had a great period there you know i took her to get a license and a passport first we went for her social security card and then we took that to the dmv and then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport it was like the triple crown of identifications jenny was wildly identifiable one night she was heading back from my apartment to hers and she stops and i said what and she says i think that we should live together and i said no i really dont think thats a good idea you know ive just decided you know as a principle im not gonna get married or live with someone its not personal and she said well unless we live together i just dont think its gonna work out cause we just dont see each other enough and i dont think that we stand a chance thats how i feel so we moved in together and one day jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends and she invites me to come along and i said oh no thanks that doesnt go over so well she says why and i said well as you know i dont believe in marriage and so i dont buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it she said well what do you believe in and i said i dont know she said well if you dont believe in anything how can you not believe in marriage and i said well first of all you know it just doesnt seem necessary i mean is it you know marriage is an archaic institution invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property i dont want to be a part of that second of all i dont even think we have a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is i mean one of me and andys friends was about to get engaged and we were skeptical and we said are you sure this is the person you want to be with for the rest of your life and he goes yeah i think so and we said well what if she gets in a car accident and shes disfigured would you stay with her then and he said maybe that is not an acceptable answer third of all if im so in love why does it need to be written into a government contract and im not one of these like i dont want government up in my business kind of people i think the government does a nice job delivering the mail and suggesting i dont eat poison but i just dont understand why they need to be involved in my personal relationships then finally if marriage is religious shouldnt i believe in the religion ive been to more weddings of my friends where the people on the altar dont believe in the religion of the church theyve invited us to some of them even go to classes with the priest in advance to more elaborately lie about believing in a religion they dont believe in just to have a wedding in a fancy building that is insane thats how i feel so i explain this to jenny and jenny says well if you ever did want to get married i would marry you and i said why arent you listening to any of this and jenny says thats how i feel at this point it was  in the morning wed been arguing all night and we hadnt slept i had to catch a flight at  am out of newark airport to los angeles for a show i was doing that night at this point im overtired and im angry and im late im stuffing my things in my roller suitcase and i walk out of our apartment its  am that part of the morning before the earth even exists before they program the matrix or whatever you walk out of your apartment part of the road isnt even there theres a guy with a laptop going we need a road stat whats the code for building tank you know and i get to the airport the news hasnt even started yet its just an anchor looking around like what are you up to and i get to the kiosk and i print up my ticket and i bring it to the security lady and she looks at me and she goes well that aint your gate like i guess they changed the gate but the way she said it was as though i had participated in the decision of changing it i was like i was not involved in this process i wasnt even ccd like as though i had gone to the kiosk and been like  like hell im flying out of  and then i photoshopped my own ticket printed it out and been like this is where im going you know im not that aggressive as a traveler so i was like well where is this gate she goes its in another terminal you got to take a tram she points to the tram and i start walking my roller suitcase and i hear her say and you better run like i guess i was late at that point so i started running and the roller suitcase does not enjoy running the roller suitcase was like i dont want to run i have wheels and i was like i dont want to run either but this is what we have to do i tell you what when we get to the hotel ill walk you in circles for a few hours then i i get to the tram and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives and it says zero minutes i was like perfect thats exactly how long i want to wait but the trams riding away i was like thats  minute then it says ten minutes and im experiencing that psychological downward spiral like oh great im gonna miss my flight and then im gonna miss every flight from now on and im gonna miss my family reunion and then im not gonna have a family and then im gonna be a crack whore and its like all of a sudden im a crack whore just because i miss this one flight i can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time andi get on the next tram ten minutes later and i run to the gate and im sweaty and im out of breath but im on time and im so relieved that i sit down in a chair at the gate and i fall asleep and i wake up to the sound of the door shutting i jump up and the door is closed and i am on the sad side of the door the happy side has an airplane and a pilot the sad side is me and the cinnabon lady normally id be very excited if it were just me and the cinnabon lady im a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year i think thats an effective use of time but in this instance i needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane and the cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community i was like do you know these people she was like all i know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun i ran up to the giant glass window i started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy i was like drew barrymores character come back she didnt come back and i missed my flight i got on the next one they could get me on there was a stopover in texas you know how i feel about texas and uh i get to los angeles late that night and id missed my show id never missed one of my shows before and im so angry and jennys calling me but im not picking up the phone cause im blaming this entire day on her i get back to my friend andys house and i said andy this relationship is messing up my entire life and andy goes youre right i go i know im right he goes yeah youre right i go i know im right i got to tell her about this in the morning i drive out of andys small road and im tboned thats the culinary way of describing it in   seconds im spun around and i think im dead no wait im paralyzed and then i hear nothing then i hear the other car skid out and drive away  minutes later im sitting on a curb at this point the police have arri have arrived as well as my friend andy and thats when i start crying you know how when you drop a baby on the ground it doesnt doesnt start crying right away because it doesnt understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face and then its like oh i guess i should be doing something that matches that waah im crying because im looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that in that moment i might have ceased to exist like i said earlier i dont really believe in anything so in my mind that would have been the end of all things id experienced in my life every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion and the officer comes over and he says what happened and i said i got hit by this car and then i heard nothing and then i heard the other car skid out and drive away the officer points over to the light the other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree i cant help but think thats karma thats a hit and run and hit and then the officer puts this form in my face and he goes sign this and i said well what does it mean and he goes it means youre okay and that we can leave i was really shaken up i was like i dont know if im okay and he goes just sign it which is a very unattractive quality when someone just repeats a command that youve just said no to and its unattractive but very effective you know i signed it andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution but we have to wait two hours cause the other driver had beat us there and eventually were with the doctor and andy says to him he goes well was the other guy drunk and the doctor says well i cant answer that and andy says was he he uses the technique we had learned earlier and it works you know the doctor says well hes heading to jail now and andy and i flash each other a look like the hardy boys like case closed a few hours later were back at andys house its probably around  in the morning and i have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have neardeath experiences i say i need to call jenny and tell her that we need to get married and andy says mike sleep on it and i said no no no this makes perfect sense and i pick up my phone and i dial her number and he puts his hand over the phone and he says mike sleep on it he saves me the next morning i fly back to new york and a few weeks later i get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that i just described and it had found me at fault and that i owed and im not making this up  for the repairs on the other drivers mercedes suv and i was like well this cant be happening i explained to the woman i think its a misunderstanding the other guy was clearly drunk it was definitely not my fault and she said im really sorry but unless they change the accident report you owe this money so i requested the accident report and im gonna show you the actual accident report tonight i dont know if youve ever seen one of these things before but its a little bit like homework for cops and officer timson not so good with the homework he consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two vehicle one and vehicle two at one point so badly that he says  thats me started to go but all of a sudden  thats me also came at a high rate of speed crashing into him now im pretty selfdestructive as a person but i would never crash into my own car with my own car nor would i understand how you could do that this part is even crazier the other drivers statement at the scene of the accident was i was on venice going uh im not too sure i was going away from the beach i was driving i dont know what happened did i hurt anyone i dont know where i was going but i came from home i had a sip of beer which is really everyones favorite quantity of beer just the one sip right thats what they serve these days at the homebeachpubso all of its mine the officer makes one key mistake he checks the box that finds me at fault so im like i need to get officer timson on the phone so we can clear up this misunderstanding the problem is he keeps ducking my calls and i know cause im calling two or three times a day leaving messages calling departments next to his department so he knows im trying to reach him and finally after a month of this i get him on the phone and im so relieved and i explain this misunderstanding and he listens to me and he says do the right thing and pay for the guys car i know and i mean thats what i said i go arent you listening to any of this i go and this guy was clearly drunk i mean he nearly killed me inches from where he hit and i would be dead right now and he wants me to pay for his car dont you see how crazy that is just as one human being to another and he says do the right thing and pay for the guys car and he hangs up the phone and at this point this stops being about money and its just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law this is chinatown so i started printing up google maps of the scene of the accident and california state driving law im on the phone with lawyers and private investigators theres only one lawyer who would consider the case and he was an accident lawyer and he said did you have any loss of income from the accident and i said no and he says did you have any loss of income from the accident and i said no this isnt about money and he doesnt take the case and this is when i start going completely madim up to about  or  am every night just surfing the web i get a subscription to a site called netdetectivecom which is a great site for vigilantes who have  so now i know this guys name i know where he lives i know what he does for a living and in my mind it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller like jim bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this but jim bosworth had another thing coming mike birbiglia i was like im gonna track down jim bosworth im gonna sue jim bosworth and im gonna sue the entire los angeles police department at this point people stopped talking to me entirely my friends would call me like hey whats going on id be like ill tell you whats going on id tell them this whole story and theyd be like you should get a lawyer id be like this is way past lawyers a lawyer wouldnt even touch this cause he wouldntthe only person who would talk to me at this point was jenny one night we were out to dinner at a restaurant and shes talking to me but im not listening cause im writing down ideas i have for the case on my napkin ive drawn out a diagram of the intersection and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in the laws the other driver broke and the phone numbers im gonna call that week and im so angry im writing over my own handwriting to the point where im ripping through the napkin and jenny looks at me and she says what are you doing and i said well this is my case and she says well why dont you work on that in the morning and i said well which part of this napkin dont you understand jenny says mike youre right but its only hurting you and im just so glad that youre alive and i think that we should focus on that she only has to say it once and i give up the case and i pay for this guys car july   jenny and i went to city hall and got married i still didnt believe in the idea of marriage and i still dont but i believe in her and ive given up on the idea of being right thank you guys very much thank you thank you guys so much thanks for coming here tonight and joining me epic your email address will not be published required fields are

[Upbeat music playing] Hello! Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down. [Chuckles] Thank you, Boston. I appreciate that. [Whooping] Uh, that\\u2019s very sweet of you. [Man] Love you! I\\u2019m at the end of the tour right now. I\\u2019m very happy to be on tour because I now have a child. Ah, so\\u2026 any time out of home is good for me. Um, I got my girlfriend pregnant after knowing her for two months. So\\u2026 [Audience cheering] Thank you. Thank you. Life decisions. And she\\u2019s a nice girl, and I love her in a way, sure. My problem with my girlfriend is, she\\u2019s very sweet, but she\\u2019s shit at telling stories, and I\\u2019m awesome at telling stories, so it really bothers me when she talks. And I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019ll be a problem in the future, but it\\u2019s a problem now and I don\\u2019t see it getting better. Um\\u2026 I\\u2019ll give you an example, right? I was in the car, and my son Hank was asleep in the back seat, and we\\u2019re driving along, and on the radio comes Madonna, and my girlfriend just slips into conversation, \\u201cOh, I used to party with Madonna.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cYou fucking what, when?\\u201d And she went, \\u201cI used to party with Madonna.\\u201d Now, I should fill you in a little bit on this. My girlfriend used to be a model in Miami, right? I\\u2019m not bragging. I didn\\u2019t get the model years. I didn\\u2019t get those years. I\\u2019ve seen the photos. Very impressive. Um\\u2026 So, I said, \\u201cSo you used to party with Madonna. Madonna used to have big parties and invite models over, right?\\u201d And she went, \\u201cNo, no, it would just be me and a few other people.\\u201d I go, \\u201cYou need to elaborate on this story right now.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cOh, okay, I used to date the center for the Miami Heat.\\u201d As soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an NBA center, even if this guy\\u2019s even slightly in proportion\\u2026 a lot of things flood through your head. First thing is, \\u201cThat\\u2019s why your cunt\\u2019s so fucked up.\\u201d That\\u2019s a big one. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why our child came out while you were walking. I understand.\\u201d So she said, \\u201cI used to date the center for the Miami Heat. His best friend was Dennis Rodman. Dennis Rodman used to go out with Madonna, and we used to go over to Madonna\\u2019s house.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cThis one time, the four of us were over at Madonna\\u2019s house, and we were all fucked up on drugs, and one thing led to another\\u2026\\u201d And then I went, \\u201cShut the fuck up!\\u201d And she went, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I said, \\u201cI know what \\u2018one thing led to another\\u2019 means! You all started fucking each other!\\u201d And she went, \\u201cWe did. We started\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cJust shut up!\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cWhat do you care for?\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re the mother of my child! I don\\u2019t wanna picture you being fucked by a 7\\u20192\\u2033 NBA player while you\\u2019re licking out Madonna\\u2019s muscular vagina and Dennis Rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock, going\\u2026\\u201d [Moaning] And she goes, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re being silly. What do you care for? You\\u2019ve partied way more than I have in my life.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cThat is not true. I\\u2019ve gotten wasted way more than you have, but I have, in no way, partied way more than you have. Often, I get wasted just by myself. I wouldn\\u2019t call it a party.\\u201d For most of my career, I was a struggling comedian, right? And this is how struggling comedians party, right? It\\u2019s 5:00 a.m., Monday, right? We\\u2019re in a one-bedroom apartment. Seven of us are standing around a coffee table, trying to stretch out two grams of coke. One of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories\\u2026 and the rest of us are talking about where women might be. One of us has come up with a plan. The plan goes like this, \\u201cWell\\u2026 nurses will be finishing their shift soon. Maybe if we just stand out the front of the ER, they\\u2019ll appreciate seven funny guys.\\u201d [Chuckles] I don\\u2019t\\u2026 You know, I\\u2019ve never partied like a model. I have partied twice in my life. Twice. Like, really partied. I\\u2019ve had good nights out, but I\\u2019ve really partied twice. If you really party, and most people never experience this, it\\u2019s an amazing thing. It happens in Vegas. It can only happen in Vegas, and it\\u2019s gotta involve celebrity, right? I\\u2019m not famous, but the people around me were super famous, and I was at this party in the night club, and they took me in. And then there\\u2019s the night club, but then there\\u2019s the real night club out the back, which is, like, the size of this stage. It\\u2019s only a little room. And you go back there and you can just\\u2026 They encourage you to take drugs in the open, and you\\u2019re just doing it off a key, [Sniffs] and they\\u2019re going, \\u201cNo, dude. Use the table. Don\\u2019t use your\\u2026\\u201d And I go, \\u201cOh, oh. Oh, sorry. Um\\u2026\\u201d And it\\u2019s confusing at first, and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room. Just bring \\u2019em in like, \\u201cHuh?\\u201d And you can do this. You can go\\u2026 \\u201cUh\\u2026\\u201d Like that. And they\\u2019ll drag these women away. It is the best thing you\\u2019ll ever do with your life. When you party that hard as a man, there\\u2019s a lot of remorse \\u2019cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money. You wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover, and you go to your friends. You go, \\u201cOh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I spent $5,000.\\u201d When a hot girl parties that hard, she wakes up in the morning and goes, \\u201cOh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I made $5,000.\\u201d And that\\u2019s a vastly different emotion that\\u2026 I don\\u2019t think women will never\\u2026 Yeah, okay. This is the thing. In America, at the moment, they\\u2019re trying to raise the minimum wage to, I don\\u2019t know, $16 an hour or something like that, and whenever they bring up this argument, they always go, \\u201cAnd still to this day, women only earn 70% of what men earn in the workplace.\\u201d And of course, that\\u2019s disgusting. How dare women earn so much? Like\\u2026 a lot of things that I say tonight will be jokes that I don\\u2019t actually mean, but this is something I\\u2019m really passionate about. Women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace. I\\u2019m sorry. I\\u2026 [Audience whooping] I\\u2019m not being a misogynistic bastard, right? I\\u2019m not saying that women don\\u2019t work as hard. I\\u2019m sure they do. I\\u2019m not saying they don\\u2019t do as good a job. What I\\u2019m saying is they don\\u2019t deserve to earn as much money as men. Right? Men need that extra 30% to buy meals and drinks and Jim Jefferies tickets and all that shit! [Audience cheering] Now\\u2026 I\\u2019m sure there\\u2019s women in this room that are saying, \\u201cOh, I pay for my drinks. I bought my own ticket.\\u201d And don\\u2019t think we don\\u2019t appreciate the uglies, \\u2019cause we do. Right? We do. But there\\u2019s little things in society that you can\\u2019t change. Men have extra expenses that you\\u2019ll never understand. There\\u2019s holidays that are just for women. Like Valentine\\u2019s Day is just for women. They say it\\u2019s for romantics. They say it\\u2019s for couples or something like that. It\\u2019s just for women. There\\u2019s no man who gets excited by Valentine\\u2019s Day. There\\u2019s no man that when he sees the Valentine\\u2019s Day decorations go up in the shopping mall, he goes, \\u201cOh, Valentine\\u2019s Day is coming!\\u201d Valentine\\u2019s Day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head, and it goes like this, \\u201cHow much money do I have to spend today so that you won\\u2019t act like a cunt?\\u201d It doesn\\u2019t stop there. Mother\\u2019s Day! Mother\\u2019s Day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old. My girlfriend\\u2019s first Mother\\u2019s Day. And she went, \\u201cOh, I wonder what I\\u2019ll get for Mother\\u2019s Day.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cProbably fucking nothing. He\\u2019s got no money. He\\u2019s six months old. What do you think he\\u2019s gonna buy you?\\u201d Within an hour, her friends were over at the house, just by coincidence, telling me what a bad person I was and how important Mother\\u2019s Day is to a new mum, you know? And so, I went and bought her a cappuccino machine \\u2019cause I assumed that\\u2019s what Hank would have wanted her to have\\u2026 and I wrote a card. I\\u2019m not a bastard. I wrote a card. I\\u2019m right-handed. So I got my left hand. Every new dad knows this. You get the crayon and you go, [Imitating child] \\u201cHappy Mother\\u2019s Day. Love, Hank.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cH-A-N\\u2026\\u201d And then I did the \\u201cK\\u201d back-to-front because he\\u2019s a fucking moron. See, now I know there\\u2019s people in the room, they\\u2019re thinking, \\u201cWell, fathers have Father\\u2019s Day.\\u201d Father\\u2019s Day is bullshit. It\\u2019s fucking shit, Father\\u2019s Day. Father\\u2019s Day came around and my girlfriend went, \\u201cWhat do you want for Father\\u2019s Day?\\u201d And I went, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want anything. Don\\u2019t even worry about it. I don\\u2019t want anything.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cCome on. You gotta have something.\\u201d I said, \\u201cHonestly, I don\\u2019t want anything.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cCome on.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cIt\\u2019s my fucking money. Just don\\u2019t touch it. Just leave my money alone. How hard is this? How about, for 24 hours, you don\\u2019t touch my fucking money? That would be a gift.\\u201d That\\u2019s why every single father has that one Father\\u2019s Day gift that they cherish, and it\\u2019s shit! It\\u2019s, like, a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handle\\u2019s too big, and it says, \\u201cI heart Dad.\\u201d And they keep that for 20 fucking years, this mug. And do you wanna know why they like it? Every now and again, they look at it and go\\u2026 \\u201cThat cost me nothing, that mug.\\u201d [Audience whooping] See\\u2026 wouldn\\u2019t it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff, but didn\\u2019t cost anything, that everyone could participate in, right? I\\u2019ve got it, right? April 18th\\u2026 Anal Sex Day. [Men cheering loudly] It\\u2019s good, isn\\u2019t it? Everyone\\u2019s girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on April 18th. It\\u2019s nice. A month before, you\\u2019d be walking around the shopping center going, \\u201cOh, the decorations are up!\\u201d [Men whooping] And it\\u2019s good \\u2019cause if your bird didn\\u2019t take it in the ass, you could do the same thing that women do on Valentine\\u2019s Day when they don\\u2019t get a gift. You could go like, \\u201cOh, me mate, Jason, his wife took it in the ass twice. Yeah, obviously, they\\u2019re more connected than we are. They\\u2019ve, uh\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, I don\\u2019t do much merchandise after my shows and stuff, but I\\u2019m thinking of bringing out some April 18th T-shirts. Not even putting \\u201cJim Jefferies\\u201d on them or anything. Just T-shirts that say, \\u201cApril 18th.\\u201d \\u2018Cause it\\u2019s good, right? You\\u2019re in a bar. You\\u2019re a guy. You see a guy at the other end of the bar with an April 18th, and you go\\u2026 Fucking friends for life, right? But even better, you see a girl with an April 18th T-shirt. The weird thing is I\\u2019m bigging-up anal sex here, and I don\\u2019t even really like fucking girls in the ass that much. I\\u2019m not even a huge fan. I much prefer the cunt. I think it\\u2019s a much more\\u2026 I think that a cunt is a much more purpose-built thing to fuck. But, you know, anal sex\\u2026 Oh, you know\\u2026 I do it. I get involved, \\u2019cause I feel like I have to. You know, I\\u2026 But I\\u2019ve never been a big fan of the ass fucking, I, uh\\u2026 When I watch it on porn, it seems very inviting. The girl\\u2019s taking it so fluently in her ass, and she seems to be having fun, and, uh\\u2026 But the thing is, you can\\u2019t smell porn. You don\\u2019t smell porn. You just\\u2026 You just watch it. They never\\u2026 And it\\u2019s different, porn. It\\u2019s different. They clean the girl\\u2019s asshole. They pump water into it until it\\u2019s very hygienic. I\\u2019m sure. And the girl seems to be so happy. She\\u2019s like\\u2026 You\\u2019ve got it in her pussy, you\\u2019re fucking her, and then she\\u2019s like, \\u201cPut it in my ass.\\u201d She\\u2019s inviting. It\\u2019s like you\\u2019re doing her a favor in porn. And then she\\u2019s like\\u2026 She says things\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know, things like, \\u201cI\\u2019m enjoying that. Keep putting it in my ass. Fuck my ass. I love a cock in my ass.\\u201d And\\u2026 And the experience I\\u2019ve had in my own life has been vastly different. I\\u2019ve\\u2026 My experience has been a lot of crying. Now, although that can help you come at times, it\\u2019s not what you want\\u2026 It\\u2019s not what you want for every day. I like the girl who acts like she\\u2019s enjoying it. Like, you know when your girlfriend\\u2019s like, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna act like I enjoy it.\\u201d She does that whole, \\u201cYeah. Oh, no, that\\u2019s good.\\u201d [Moaning] Ahh! \\u266a I\\u2019m having a good time \\u266a And then they\\u2019re always going, \\u201cAre you done? Are you close to done?\\u201d You never fuck a pussy and they go, \\u201cAre you almost done? Finish this.\\u201d Like that. If you\\u2019re fucking ass, they don\\u2019t want you\\u2026 They want it all over, quick. And they do other things, the porn girls. I don\\u2019t know how much they get paid. I\\u2019m sure it\\u2019s more than what the men get paid. It\\u2019s the opposite bit of society. Um\\u2026 But they do a thing called \\u201cATM.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know if you know what that is, kids. That stands for \\u201cass to mouth.\\u201d That\\u2019s where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus, and she\\u2019ll put it directly in her mouth, and she\\u2019ll say something like, \\u201cI love the taste of my ass. Let me taste my ass.\\u201d And then the man, as a favor to this woman, puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work\\u2026 [Applause] she\\u2019s been doing. Now, I had a drunken night with my ex-girlfriend where she thought she\\u2019d be all wild and try that. Once again, vastly different experience. I\\u2019m not a big fan of the ass fucking, and I don\\u2019t know of any man, if they\\u2019re truthful, really is. Now, there\\u2019s women in the room who are thinking, \\u201cWell, why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass?\\u201d [Woman shouting] What a good question. [Woman whoops] Women, the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because\\u2026 we know you fucking hate it. [Cheering] So\\u2026 I\\u2019m a father. Um\\u2026 I love my son! I love my son the same way that I love cigarettes. I like to hold him for five minutes every hour, and the rest of the time, I\\u2019m thinking about how he\\u2019s fucking killing me. He\\u2019s a good little boy. No, he\\u2019s a great little fella. I really like him. Um\\u2026 My girlfriend super loves him, though. It\\u2019s fucking creepy. And\\u2026 I\\u2019m glad I have a son. That worked out good for me. I wouldn\\u2019t be a good father to a girl. It wouldn\\u2019t be good for me. Nothing weird. Wouldn\\u2019t fuck it. I\\u2026 I just don\\u2019t get along with women. You know how it is. I don\\u2019t want them in my house, and\\u2026 So\\u2026 Because you dream, see\\u2026 For example, okay? When Hank was born\\u2026 the couple over the road, within two weeks of Hank being born, had a baby girl, and rightly or wrongly, the first thing that went through my head was\\u2026 \\u201cAw, that\\u2019s great. I hope Hank fucks that one day.\\u201d That\\u2019s what I think\\u2026 \\u2018Cause that\\u2019s what I think about my son. I hope when he\\u2019s of age, he just fucks everything. I don\\u2019t care if my son is gay or straight. All I care about is, when he is of age, that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires. That is my dream for my son! [Audience cheering] But never in the history of fathers and daughters, has a father held his baby girl and gone, \\u201cOh, I hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life. I hope you\\u2019re never shy of a cock. I hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up.\\u201d Right, you know\\u2026 And it\\u2019s not just me. Women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well. My girlfriend goes to the gym every morning. I go there very occasionally, and when you go to the gym, there\\u2019s a little daycare cr\\u00e8che thing in the gym where you can hand your child off, and inside that daycare, there\\u2019s, like, three women in their 50s. They\\u2019re very nice ladies, and you hand your kid off and he plays. Then when you finish your workout, you come and get him. And there\\u2019s a woman that works there who just loves my son. She sees all the other kids, but she loves Hank, and Hank fucking loves her, and the two of them light up when they see each other. And it\\u2019s super cute, I bring Hank up the stairs, and he starts going, \\u201cUh, uh!\\u201d Trying to reach at her, all right? And she does this, she goes, \\u201cEveryone, my boyfriend\\u2019s here. Here\\u2019s my boyfriend. Give him here. He\\u2019s my boyfriend.\\u201d And then she kisses him, and she goes, \\u266a My boyfriend gives me kisses My boyfriend gives me kisses \\u266a It\\u2019s fucking adorable. But I tried doing that with a baby girl\\u2026 Let\\u2019s say you go to the gym and there\\u2019s a daycare, and me and a couple of my mates are working there. \\u201cHey, everyone\\u2026 me girlfriend\\u2019s here. Give her here. Give her here. She\\u2019s my girlfriend. My girlfriend gives me kisses. You know that, right? She\\u2019s always giving me kisses. Enjoy your workout. Don\\u2019t worry about a thing.\\u201d [Applause] [Cheering] So\\u2026 Also\\u2026 it\\u2019s just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter. It\\u2019s just little things. Even when they\\u2019re babies, it\\u2019s just easier. There\\u2019s a wiping technique when you\\u2019re wiping a baby\\u2019s ass. I don\\u2019t know if you have children, but this is how you do it. The baby lays on its back. You put their feet together. You lift the feet up, and then you go in and wipe. With a boy, you can wipe like that. Up and down, side to side, whatever the fuck you want, right? With a girl, you gotta wipe downward and away. Downward and away. It\\u2019s very important that you wipe away from the cunt. Very important. \\u2018Cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts. They do. They fucking hate it. Boys don\\u2019t give a shit. Fucking\\u2026 My son will have shit all over his dick and balls, and I\\u2019ll be cleaning it off under the foreskin, and he\\u2019ll be laughing like it\\u2019s the best day ever. Even at my age now, I find it funny if I have shit on my dick. If I fuck my girlfriend in the ass, I pull out, I\\u2019ve got shit on my dick, I\\u2019ll ring me mate Jason up and go, \\u201cHey, Jason\\u2026 It\\u2019s happened again. I got shit on my dick.\\u201d And he\\u2019ll tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick, and we\\u2019ll laugh and laugh and laugh. But never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and she\\u2019s thought, \\u201cOh, I can\\u2019t wait to call Karen.\\u201d [Chuckles] [Laughs] When you\\u2026 When my girlfriend got pregnant\\u2026 When you meet\\u2026 When you haven\\u2019t got a child, couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children. Whenever you meet couples with children they\\u2019re always like, \\u201cIt is the most fulfilling thing I\\u2019ve ever done with my life. My heart grows larger and larger every day.\\u201d And then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant, those same people went like this, \\u201cYou\\u2019re never gonna sleep again! [Laughs maniacally] Forget about it. It\\u2019s over. You\\u2019re not gonna sleep.\\u201d They\\u2019re constantly telling you you\\u2019re not gonna sleep. Raising a baby is not that hard. I\\u2019ll tell you what, it\\u2019s easier than a coke habit. I had a coke habit for seven-and-a-half fucking years! At least it\\u2019s not me who wakes up crying anymore! I can sleep through other people crying. I\\u2019ve had girlfriends. That\\u2019s like white noise to me. I find it soothing. See, me and my girlfriend, just two months, we went, \\u201cFuck it! Let\\u2019s have a kid.\\u201d Fucking did it, right? These other people, man\\u2026 You know these couples, and they date from high school, and then they go out for a bit longer, and then after being together for like, seven years, they go, \\u201cWe\\u2019re getting engaged. You wanna come to the party?\\u201d And you wanna say, \\u201cNo, you\\u2019re really boring and we hate you.\\u201d But you go, \\u201cOh, okay, great. You\\u2019re still together, are you? You fucked one person, have you? Oh, how exciting.\\u201d And\\u2026 And then what they do is they don\\u2019t have a kid right away because they\\u2019re still not ready. \\u201cWe have to see how our careers are going and shit.\\u201d And what they do is they get a dog, and then they act like the fucking dog\\u2019s their baby. They refer to it as their fucking baby. They send you a Christmas card of them holding the dog\\u2026 and it says, \\u201cFrom our family to yours.\\u201d And then you have a barbecue, and you invite them, the humans, right? Then they come over. This fucking dog runs in, jumping over everything, and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cWhat the fuck is this shit?\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe had to bring him. We bring our baby everywhere.\\u201d And you go, \\u201cWell, your baby is biting my actual baby. Can you control\\u2026\\u201d And then, eventually, they decide they\\u2019re gonna have a kid \\u2019cause they\\u2019ve learned so much from the dog, and then they bring the kid back, and the dog runs up, like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s happening? A new person.\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cFuck off. We don\\u2019t love you anymore. We\\u2019re going.\\u201d And they think they\\u2019ve learnt something from the dog, and they haven\\u2019t learnt anything. What happens if your girlfriend\\u2019s away on work and the dog dies? You go off, you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog\\u2026 try to pass it off as the same dog. What happens if your girlfriend\\u2019s away on work and the baby dies? Very hard\\u2026 to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have. Easier if you\\u2019re black or Asian. [Audience cheering] Boston, no! No! No! Shut up! I will not put up with racism at my shows, okay? I\\u2019m not saying \\u2019cause they look the same. I\\u2019m saying \\u2019cause they\\u2019re easier to purchase. [Audience cheering] [Audience whooping] If Angelina Jolie and Madonna have taught us anything\\u2026 it is that you can buy black and Asian people. I\\u2019m yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from Norway with a child, going\\u2026 \\u201cYolanda, quick, get Hans. Bring him over. Come on.\\u201d [Jeffries chuckles] I\\u2019m gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit. Uh\\u2026 Gun control. Now\\u2026 No, wait. Before you\\u2026 Don\\u2019t get excited because the other people have guns. The anti-gun people are like, \\u201cYeah! Do it, Jim!\\u201d No, let\\u2019s just\\u2026 [Shushes] Now, before I start saying this, I wanna say this, right? I believe in your right as Americans to have guns. I\\u2019m not trying to stop you from having guns. All I\\u2019m saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion. My opinion on the\\u2026 Oh, it doesn\\u2019t matter. I don\\u2019t like guns, right? I\\u2019m gonna say some things that are just facts, right? In Australia, we had guns, right? Right up until 1996. In 1996, Australia had the biggest massacre on Earth. It still hasn\\u2019t been beaten. And\\u2026 Now, after that, they banned the guns. Now, in the 10 years before Port Arthur, there was 10 massacres. Since the gun ban in 1996, there hasn\\u2019t been a single massacre since. I don\\u2019t know how or why this happened, uh\\u2026 Maybe it was a coincidence, right? Now, please understand that I understand that Australia and America are two vastly different cultures with different people, right? I get it. In Australia, we had the biggest massacre on Earth, and the Australian government went, \\u201cThat\\u2019s it! No more guns!\\u201d And we all went, \\u201cYeah, all right, then. That seems fair enough, really.\\u201d Now, in America, you had the Sandy Hook massacre where little, tiny children died, and your government went, \\u201cMaybe\\u2026 we\\u2019ll get rid of the big guns?\\u201d And 50% of you went, \\u201cFuck you! Don\\u2019t take my guns!\\u201d [Whooping] So, here\\u2019s where it gets confusing, right? Now, as I said, I am all for your Second Amendment rights. I think you should be able to have guns. It\\u2019s in your constitution. What I am not for is bullshit arguments and lies. There is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun, and this is the argument\\u2026 \\u201cFuck off. I like guns.\\u201d It\\u2019s not the best argument, but it\\u2019s all you\\u2019ve got. And there\\u2019s nothing wrong with it. There\\u2019s nothing wrong with saying, \\u201cI like something. Don\\u2019t take it away from me.\\u201d But don\\u2019t give me this other bullshit. The main one is, [In American accent] \\u201cI need it for protection. I need to protect me. I need to protect my family.\\u201d Really? Is that why they\\u2019re called \\u201cassault rifles\\u201d? Is it? I\\u2019ve never heard of these fucking \\u201cprotection rifles\\u201d you speak of. Protection? What the fuck are you talking about? You have a gun in your house, you\\u2019re 80% more likely to use that gun on yourself, than to shoot someone else. And people think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019d never happen to me.\\u201d You don\\u2019t know that, because you know what?\\n\\u266a From time to time We all get sad \\u266a \\n\\u266a One day you\\u2019re happy Then you\\u2019re sad \\u266a \\n\\u266a And then, uh-oh \\u266a\\nProtection. I had a break-in in Manchester, England, where I was tied up, I had my head cut. They threatened to rape my girlfriend. They came through the window with a machete and a hammer, and Americans always go, [In American accent] \\u201cWell, imagine if you had a gun.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAll right. I was naked at the time. I wasn\\u2019t wearing my holster. I wasn\\u2019t staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through.\\u201d What world do you live in where you\\u2019re constantly fucking ready? You have guns \\u2019cause you like guns! That\\u2019s why you go to gun conventions! That\\u2019s why you read gun magazines! None of you give a shit about home security. None of you go to home security conventions. None of you read Padlock Monthly. None of you have a Facebook picture of you behind a secure door going, \\u201cFucking yeah!\\u201d Like you\\u2019re going to be ready if someone comes into your house. You have it at all fucking times. By the way, most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking TV! You think that people are coming to murder your family? How many fucking enemies do you have? Jeez, you think a lot of yourself if you think everyone\\u2019s coming to murder you. See, if you have it readily available, it becomes unsafe. You have it in your bedside table, one of your kids picks it up, thinks it\\u2019s a toy, shoots another one of your kids. Happens every fucking day, but people go, \\u201cThat\\u2019d never happen in my house \\u2019cause I\\u2019m a responsible gun owner. I keep my guns locked in a safe.\\u201d Then they\\u2019re no fucking protection! Someone comes into the house, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cWait there, fuck-face! Oh! You\\u2019ve come to the wrong house here, buddy boy. I tell you what. I\\u2019m gonna fuck you up! Okay. Is it 32 to the left or 32 to the right? Your mother\\u2019s birthday? Why the fuck would I know your fucking mother\\u2019s birthday? Maybe if you didn\\u2019t leave the window open [In whining voice] \\u2018because it\\u2019s too hot in here,\\u2019 we wouldn\\u2019t be getting fucking murdered, right?\\u201d I find the NRA to be hard work. The fact that they always think the answer is more guns. After Sandy Hook happened, the NRA said, and I quote, \\u201cNone of this would have happened if the teachers had guns.\\u201d I\\u2026 I think they\\u2019re forgetting what school was like. Does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to\\u2026 Whenever she came into school, that relief teacher came, you and your friends would see her and go, [Chuckling] \\u201cOh, we\\u2019re gonna make her cry.\\u201d And then she\\u2019d stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking, and you\\u2019d go, \\u201cYou\\u2019re never getting married, are you, Miss? Never gonna happen for you.\\u201d Then she\\u2019d get back to her 1967 Volkswagen Beetle, and she\\u2019d be crying over the steering wheel, just, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t they like me?\\u201d Let\\u2019s give that cunt a gun and see how things work out! [Audience cheering] And then they go, \\u201cOh, well, answer to that, we\\u2019ll just add more guns.\\u201d They go, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll put an armed security guard at every school across America.\\u201d Yeah, that\\u2019ll work out. The average security guard in America earns $16 an hour. Not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero! Someone comes onto the school and\\u2026 [Mimicking machine gun] And you\\u2019ve got Kevin. Now, I\\u2019m sure Kevin\\u2019s shit-hot at Call of Duty, but it might not fucking cut it, ladies and gentlemen. Now, I understand that when I\\u2019m doing this joke in this room, 50% of you agree with me, 50% of you don\\u2019t agree with me, and I do respect the people who don\\u2019t agree with me. Don\\u2019t think I don\\u2019t. Out of the 50% that don\\u2019t agree with me, 20% of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and it\\u2019s not to be taken seriously, and they\\u2019re laughing along \\u2019cause it\\u2019s just funny jokes, right? And then the next 20%, have sort of phased out a little bit. They\\u2019re looking around, going, \\u201cWonder how they got that chandelier up there?\\u201d And then\\u2026 there\\u2019s the last 10%. And they\\u2019re fucking furious. Right now, in this room and the people watching at home\\u2026 10% of you are fucking seething. Just\\u2026 And for a couple of reasons. First reason, I\\u2019m making good points. [Audience cheering] Second reason. Second reason. Second reason, and this is the big one, I\\u2019m foreign\\u2026 and that\\u2019s pissing the fuck out of you right now, and your brain is on a loop and you can\\u2019t fucking turn it off, and it\\u2019s just going around in a circle, and you\\u2019re just going, \\u201cIf you don\\u2019t like it, go home! If you don\\u2019t like it, go home!\\u201d And my answer to that is, \\u201cNo.\\u201d I came here legally. I pay my taxes. I\\u2019ll say whatever the fuck I want. Your First Amendment means that I can say the Second Amendment sucks dicks. And\\u2026 unless you\\u2019re an American Indian, you\\u2019re a fucking immigrant as well, so fuck off. People get so precious about it. I understand that to Americans, your constitution is very important. I respect it, but please understand that every country has one as well. It\\u2019s no more special than any other constitution. We have one in Australia. I don\\u2019t know what it says. I\\u2019ve never seen it. If there\\u2019s a problem, we\\u2019ll check it, but everything\\u2019s going fine. And don\\u2019t get me wrong. I get that the constitution is important to you. I have had\\u2026 Fucking, I get it, right? I\\u2019ve had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as I\\u2019m leaving the theater, going, [In American accent] \\u201cYou cannot change the Second Amendment!\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, you can. It\\u2019s called an \\u2018amendment.'\\u201d If you can\\u2019t change something that\\u2019s called an \\u201camendment\\u201d, see, many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution. And if you don\\u2019t know what a thesaurus is, get a dictionary and work your way forward. Don\\u2019t think your constitution is set in stone. You\\u2019ve changed things before. You used to have prohibition in there, right? And then people were like, \\u201cHey, who likes getting fucked up? Yeah, I like getting fucked up, too. Let\\u2019s get that one out. Let\\u2019s get that one out.\\u201d You used to have this other thing in America called, uh\\u2026 slavery! And then Lincoln came along and went, \\u201cThat\\u2019s it. No more slaves!\\u201d And 50% of you went, \\u201cFuck you! Don\\u2019t take my slaves!\\u201d And the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns. \\u201cWhy should I have my slaves taken off me? I\\u2019m a responsible slave owner. I\\u2019m trained in how to use my slaves safely. Just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesn\\u2019t mean that my rights should be taken away from me. I\\u2026 I use my slaves to protect my family! I keep my slaves locked in a safe!\\u201d That\\u2019s the thing. \\u201cWhy should I have my guns taken off me? I\\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\\u201d Look, I agree with you. If you\\u2019re a responsible gun owner and you don\\u2019t fuck around with them, then you should be allowed your guns. You really should. But that\\u2019s not how society works. We have to play to the 1% that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us. We have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving, right? I take drugs like a fucking champion, right? [Audience cheering] We should all be allowed to take fucking drugs, but we can\\u2019t, can we? Because Sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids. Oh! \\u201cOh, thanks, Sarah. You fucked it up for everyone.\\u201d Right? Everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it, right? But we can\\u2019t because Jonathan got drunk and ran over a family. \\u201cThanks, Jonathan! Now I have to drive at 30, you fucking idiot!\\u201d See, that\\u2019s the thing. \\u201cWhy should I have my guns taken off me, I\\u2019m responsible, just because that guy\\u2019s crazy?\\u201d Who\\u2019s to say you\\u2019re not crazy? That\\u2019s the thing about crazy people. They don\\u2019t know they\\u2019re crazy. That\\u2019s what makes them crazy. The only thing you know for sure on this Earth is, \\u201cI think, therefore I am.\\u201d You know that you exist. Anything past that is open to interpretation, right? You know you exist and that\\u2019s it. Right now, I think I\\u2019m in Boston talking to 1,200 people. That\\u2019s what I think I\\u2019m doing, but there is a good to fair chance that I\\u2019m in a mental home, standing in front of a white wall, going, [Slurring speech] \\u201cI hate guns. I hate guns. I hate guns.\\u201d [Audience applauding] See, one of the better arguments is, \\u201cWell, if you take the guns away, then only the criminals will have guns.\\u201d Not true. When they banned the guns in Australia, it worked. When they banned them in Britain, it worked, okay? The Bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in Sandy Hook costs, like, $1,000 American and you can buy it in Walmart. It\\u2019ll be delivered to your house. That\\u2019s it, man. 1,000 bucks, right? That same gun in Australia on the black market costs $34,000. Now if you have $34,000, you don\\u2019t need to be a criminal. You\\u2019ve got $34,000. You\\u2019re a great little saver. Keep going. So that covers the criminals, but that doesn\\u2019t cover the people who wanna murder your family, that are coming after you and your family. It kind of does. The people who do the massacres, it covers them \\u2019cause they go\\u2026 The kid at Colorado who thought he was The Joker, let\\u2019s say that he had some social issues. The kid at Sandy Hook was Asperger\\u2019s as fuck. Right? I don\\u2019t know if you know a lot about the black market, but you can\\u2019t just rock up at the docks going, [Slurring speech] \\u201cGuns! Who wants to sell me a gun?\\u201d Now, I\\u2019m gonna wrap this up. We won\\u2019t talk about it anymore. Now\\u2026 See, the one thing that I do really agree with with the right to bear arms, I really agree with\\u2026 That the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government. In case the government became a bunch of cunts, you could all get your guns and fight back, and that\\u2019s why it was written. \\u2013 [Audience cheering] \\u2013 Yeah! And that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets. But you do know the government has drones, right? You get that? You\\u2019re bringing guns to a drone fight! If we went back to muskets, I\\u2019m all for it! Keep the Second Amendment. If we all have muskets\\u2026 Muskets are awesome! Every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times. You know what\\u2019s good about the musket? It gives you a lot of time to calm down. Someone calls your wife fat, and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cFuck you, buddy! Ah, you\\u2019re not a bad guy. You\\u2019re all right.\\u201d Now\\u2026 after the show, we\\u2019re gonna go out, have a big party around Boston, see how it goes. I\\u2019m not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore. My girlfriend has said that\\u2019s a no\\u2026 \\u2019cause I don\\u2019t behave myself in there, so I\\u2019m not allowed to go to them anymore. \\u2018Cause strip clubs aren\\u2019t what women think they are. [Stammers] It used to be like\\u2026 Okay, so, when a man goes to a strip club, it\\u2019s all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible. That\\u2019s what men want to see. Women, when they go to their Magic Mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are\\u2026 women wanna see a guy, \\u201cHey, ladies. He\\u2019s a fireman.\\u201d And he comes out with his hose and like that\\u2026 And whenever a stripper takes their clothes off, they\\u2019ve still got the fireman\\u2019s hat on or a tool belt on or policeman\\u2019s gun on a holster, right? Because even when a man\\u2019s naked, a woman wants to know that he has a job. When men watch strippers, we want them to have a job, and that job\\u2019s stripping. We want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money, and just go\\u2026 \\u201cYou can\\u2019t take care of your kids.\\u201d It\\u2019s\\u2026 And when men get private dances in these strip clubs, I don\\u2019t know\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms, but basically, it\\u2019s dry humping. There\\u2019s no dancing. The girl gets in front. She gets where your cock is, pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it\\u2026 and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face, and you go\\u2026 That\\u2019s what a private \\u201cdance\\u201d is, right? I don\\u2019t know if there\\u2019s private dancing in female strip clubs. [Stammering] I can\\u2019t imagine that there would be. I don\\u2019t imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going\\u2026 She goes, \\u201cHow was it?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cWell\\u2026 he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals\\u2026 and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead. I got to go to the ATM.\\u201d So Legit got canceled. [Audience booing] Yeah. I know. I know it. Who would\\u2019ve thought it would\\u2019ve struggled on that great FXX channel that everyone knew about? The first season is on Netflix. This special is being recorded for Netflix. So you can go watch it there if you\\u2019re watching the special. It was\\u2026 I\\u2019m very proud of it. We had two great seasons of really good television, and if people didn\\u2019t\\u2026 Now\\u2026 The whole TV show is based around one standup routine that I used to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that I took to a brothel, which is a true story. And so, when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who\\u2026 In the end, we used DJ Qualls, and DJ Qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie Road Trip. He\\u2019s the skinny white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow, and he\\u2019s the white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow. Now\\u2026 the great thing about DJ is\\u2026 he already looks disabled. He has that \\u201clatter stages of AIDS\\u201d thing going on. It\\u2019s great for casting. Anyway, but\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t want DJ to begin with. I wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic, and the Actors\\u2019 Union of America said, \\u201cYou cannot do that.\\u201d Because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy, I think, are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired. And I said, \\u201cAll right, what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer?\\u201d And they sent me a list. And on this list, I said, \\u201cCan you get rid of all the contagious ones? And what have we got left?\\u201d So I saw every disabled actor in Hollywood, and I\\u2019ll be honest with you, not that many of them. I don\\u2019t know why. Maybe they\\u2019re just lazy. They don\\u2019t wanna work. Maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly. And none of them were very good, either. Everyone we saw, none of them were very good \\u2019cause acting is all about what you do with your hands. None of them knew what to do with their hands, and\\u2026 they all came in. Until this one guy came in. I had seen a lot of people that day. This guy was the most disabled person I\\u2019d ever seen in my life. He was like\\u2026 Think of the most disabled person you\\u2019ve seen, then double it. \\u2026really super disabled. He was shaped like a pretzel. He was being carried in by this big Russian nurse, carried him in. He made that great disabled sound of\\u2026 [Groans] That one. I just loved him. Anyway\\u2026 so he comes in for the audition\\u2026 and I\\u2019m sitting there, and we\\u2019re doing the lines together, and at first, I didn\\u2019t know if he was mentally all there either, so I was being a little bit patronizing. I was going, \\u201cThank you so much for coming in.\\u201d And then we did the dialog together, and I didn\\u2019t have to worry about a thing. This kid was funny. He was smart. His timing was impeccable. I thought he was just great, and I helped him out of the room, and I come back to the director and I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s our guy. That\\u2019s who we gotta pick.\\u201d And he agreed, but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room. So the next bloke wheels himself in. Now, obviously, he\\u2019s just a paraplegic if he\\u2019s wheeling himself in, which means the waist down, and that didn\\u2019t really suit me because\\u2026 paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance. But I thought\\u2026 \\u201cIf he\\u2019s a good enough actor, maybe he can quad-up for the role.\\u201d So he comes in\\u2026 He comes in, I shake his hand, and his leg slightly comes out at the same time. And I went, \\u201cWhoa! What\\u2019s going on there, kicky?\\u201d And he goes\\u2026 \\u201cOh, you got me! I\\u2019m not disabled.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re fucking what now?\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cI\\u2019m not disabled. I just really wanted the role, so I rented a wheelchair.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cJust shut up. So let me\\u2026 This is how your day has mapped-out thus far. You woke up this morning. You drove to the wheelchair rental place. You rented a wheelchair. You carried it out, I assume. You put it in the trunk of your car. You drove here. You got the wheelchair out. You carried it up three flights of stairs. You went to the waiting room. You put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse. Then you sat in it and practiced your lines.\\u201d And he went\\u2026 \\u201cYeah.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re a fucking asshole, mate. Get the fuck out of here.\\u201d And I kicked him out. And later on that day, I\\u2019m sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors I\\u2019m gonna call to tell them they\\u2019ve got parts, and I\\u2019m holding this disabled guy\\u2019s headshot, and I just think, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna call this guy up. I\\u2019m gonna change his life. This is an awesome moment, right?\\u201d And I\\u2019m looking at it, and he looks super handsome in his headshot. He looked really like\\u2026 And I thought, \\u201cThis has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history.\\u201d The shutter on his camera has gotta be like\\u2026 [Mimicking camera shutter] Like\\u2026 [Audience applauding] And then I read the guy\\u2019s biography\\u2026 and then it dawned on me. \\u201cThis guy\\u2019s not disabled either! I hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair! This cunt rented a nurse!\\u201d Do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse? I\\u2019m all for a method actor. Get into character three hours before, but once you finish the audition, stand up and go, \\u201cTa-da!\\u201d And we would have gone, \\u201cThat was very good.\\u201d But I\\u2019ll tell you what you don\\u2019t do. Don\\u2019t make me carry you to your car! I carried him down three flights of stairs going, \\u201cYou did very good.\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cThank you, Jim.\\u201d [Laughing] [Chuckles] I was, uh\\u2026 I go to a therapist\\u2026 \\u2019cause I get depressed. So I got a therapist every now and again. I literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind.\\u201d Like just out of the movies, right? And she went, \\u201cRed,\\u201d and I went, \\u201cBlue.\\u201d And then she went, \\u201cCooking,\\u201d and I went, \\u201cFood,\\u201d and all that type of stuff. We went like this forever. And then she went\\u2026 For the last question, she went, \\u201cAnd what\\u2019s your favorite thing in the world?\\u201d And I went\\u2026 \\u201cComing on a girl\\u2019s face.\\u201d Now\\u2026 Now, I could\\u2019ve said things like\\u2026 \\u201cIce cream\\u201d is a good answer. \\u201cHank\\u201d would\\u2019ve been an excellent answer. But I said, \\u201cComing on a girl\\u2019s face.\\u201d And I\\u2019ve had six months to think about my answer, and I stand by it. \\u2013 I\\u2026 \\u2013 [Cheering] I\\u2019m not proud of it. I hate myself for thinking it. It\\u2019s such a horrible thing to do to another human. When a girl\\u2019s on her knees and you\\u2026 It\\u2019s so\\u2026 And as an atheist, I believe in Darwin and all the things that he wrote, but he never had a bit where he explained that. There was never a bit in his book where he went, \\u201cWhen a caveman loves a cavewoman, he\\u2019ll ejaculate on her face so that flies won\\u2019t come near.\\u201d There was never that\\u2026 never that moment. But, by golly, if it\\u2019s not fun. I find it\\u2026 To\\u2026 Look, to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time, may I say, \\u201cBravo!\\u201d Don\\u2019t\\u2026 don\\u2019t think what you do\\u2026 has gone unnoticed. We notice. We appreciate your work. I think you deserve a parade of some kind. During Memorial Day, after the Vietnam vets, before the First Gulf War guys, we could bring in, \\u201cAnd here\\u2019s the women who take a load on their face.\\u201d And you could march out, and married men would stand there going, \\u201cGod bless you, ladies.\\u201d [Audience cheering] I enjoy your acting that you do. The standard tongue out and the\\u2026 Like that\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know why, but I enjoy\\u2026 I know it\\u2019s a lie. I know you\\u2019re not excited, but I still appreciate the effort is what I enjoy. I love the look because it\\u2019s such a, \\u201cOh, jeez, I\\u2019m excited, too. When this come hits my face, there\\u2019s a good chance I\\u2019ll also orgasm. Anything could happen in this crazy world.\\u201d But this is what redeems us as men. This is what redeems us. Just know that the second the come shoots out of our cock and hits your face, our bodies flood with remorse. The next 20 seconds is the nicest we will ever be to you. [Men whooping] I go from being an animal to the sweetest guy on Earth. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou fucking slut\\u2026 Oh, I love you. Ah\\u2026 Uh, all right. No, no, no. Put your tongue back in. Um\\u2026 Keep your eyes shut. Just keep them shut. Uh\\u2026 All right, I\\u2019m going to get a towel. I\\u2019ll get a towel. I\\u2019ll get you a towel. All right. You\\u2019re a wonderful mother to our child.\\u201d [Laughs] [Audience cheering] See\\u2026 this is what kills me. My son will one day watch this DVD. And I\\u2019m the guy who\\u2019s meant to teach him right from wrong, and I\\u2019m there wiping come off his mother\\u2019s face. I think I did something illegal with my son the other day. I think it might be illegal. Tell me if this is illegal. All right? I\\u2019m in the shower. My girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning, and when she came back, I was in the shower, and Hank ran up, and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like, \\u201cArgh!\\u201d Like that. And I went\\u2026 [Vocalizing] And I saw his little face and I went, \\u201cHello, Hankie.\\u201d And then in the condensation, I drew a little bowtie on him\\u2026 and a little suit\\u2026 and then I gave him a voice bubble that said, \\u201cI love my daddy. Love, Hank.\\u201d But I did it so I could read it. Well, of course he could read the \\u201cK,\\u201d and\\u2026 then I stepped out. I stepped out of the bathroom and I went, \\u201cG\\u2019day, Hankie!\\u201d And he slapped my cock and he ran off. Now, is that illegal? I don\\u2019t know. Is it illegal because, A, a child touched my cock, or because, B, I found it really funny and I\\u2019ve been telling everyone. And I can\\u2019t get angry at him because his whole life, he\\u2019s been lying on mats with things dangling over. He\\u2019s been training for this his entire life. I think I\\u2019ve, uh\\u2026 I think I\\u2019ve become American, more American than I am Australian lately, and there was a moment where I tipped over where I went, \\u201cOh, I think like an American person now.\\u201d And I\\u2019m happy to do it. I just\\u2026 I\\u2019ll tell you what happened. I was flying around\\u2026 I was doing a tour of Australia, and I was flying domestically around Australia, and I\\u2019m so used to airports and stuff here in America that\\u2026 Okay, what happens is, when you go\\u2026 I was flying Sydney to Melbourne. When you fly domestically in Australia, you go up to the machine, put your name in, prints your ticket out, it prints your bag thing, you put the bag thing on your bag yourself, and then there\\u2019s a conveyor belt underneath. You throw your bag on. Bag fucks off. You don\\u2019t speak to anyone. Then I go up to the gate bit, and the lady\\u2019s going, \\u201cTickets, please.\\u201d And I\\u2019m holding my ID out like a fucking simpleton. \\u2018Cause I get through airports quick, man. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cFucking there you go.\\u201d And she went, \\u201cPut your ID away. I don\\u2019t need to see that.\\u201d And I went\\u2026 \\u201cI think you do.\\u201d And she went, \\u201cI don\\u2019t\\u2026 Why would I need to see your ID?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI might be a terrorist.\\u201d And she went, \\u201cWould showing me your ID stop you from blowing the plane up?\\u201d \\u201cNo, I\\u2019d probably still blow the plane up.\\u201d So then I get up to the TSA conveyor belt thing, and I\\u2019m so good at the airports. I\\u2019m already taking my shoes off as I\\u2019m walking, right? And all the Australians behind me assume that I\\u2019m American, and they\\u2019re losing their fucking shit. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, for fuck\\u2019s sake! One of these cunts, eh?\\u201d And the TSA guy goes, \\u201cHey, mate, what are you taking your shoes off for?\\u201d And I went\\u2026 [Shouting] \\u201cI don\\u2019t know! Maybe they\\u2019re bombs?\\u201d And he went\\u2026 \\u201cBut they\\u2019re not, are they?\\u201d I put me shoes back on. I get my laptop out. Everyone\\u2019s going mental. And the TSA guy says, very politely, but extraordinarily sarcastically, he goes, \\u201cJeez, mate. That\\u2019s a nice computer. Why are you showing it to everyone?\\u201d \\u201cIt might also be a bomb.\\u201d And then the guy said the most Australian thing I\\u2019ve ever heard come out of anyone\\u2019s mouth ever. He went\\u2026 \\u201cOh, come on, mate. You wouldn\\u2019t have two bombs.\\u201d [Audience laughing] [Chuckles] I\\u2019m not even quite sure what that means, but it does make some type of sense. All right. Oscar Pistorius. If you haven\\u2019t been following the case, you\\u2019re missing out. This is the greatest thing since OJ Simpson. You\\u2019re fucking missing out, mate. If you don\\u2019t know who Oscar Pistorius is, let me fill you in. Oscar Pistorius is a legless man from South Africa, known as the Blade Runner. He ran in two Olympics, the disabled and the able-bodied Olympics in one year. No one has ever done that. He\\u2019s an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and able-bodied people alike, and on Valentine\\u2019s Day last year, he shot and killed the hottest girl on Earth\\u2026 and that\\u2019s when he became an inspiration to me\\u2026 \\u2019cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long. Let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there. You can\\u2019t just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want. [Mock tearfully] People have feelings, you cunts. Now, there\\u2019s a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day. One of the theories is that they found in her phone\\u2026 He went through her phone, and on her phone, he found some text messages from a South African rugby player on Valentine\\u2019s Day, right? Now, I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever been to South Africa, but in South Africa, rugby is more popular than legless running. It goes, rugby, legless running, cricket. Legless running\\u2019s their second sport. You wouldn\\u2019t have thought that. Anyway\\u2026 I\\u2019m going to reenact what I believe happened that day. To do that, I will now be doing a South African accent. Now I know, many of you can\\u2019t tell the difference between my accent and a South African accent. Here\\u2019s the difference. Picture my accent, but I\\u2019m punching a black person. What I\\u2019m trying to say is South Africans are horrible people. So\\u2026 she\\u2019s coming out of the shower. She\\u2019s been drying her hair. She\\u2019s listening to Rodriguez or something. She comes out. He\\u2019s laying on the bed. He looks up at her, he\\u2019s holding the phone, and he goes, [In South African accent] \\u201cWhat the fuck is this? I\\u2019ve been through your phone. You have been texting a rugby player.\\u201d And she\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh! Fuck you! Who the fuck do you think you are?\\u201d \\u201cWho am I? I\\u2019m Oscar Pistorius, the greatest legless runner that has ever been. That\\u2019s who the fuck I am.\\u201d \\u201cWell, I would rather be with a rugby player. At least he is a whole man, not a three-quarter man like you.\\u201d \\u2013 [Audience exclaiming] \\u2013 I know. [Audience laughing] \\u201cOh! Fuck you!\\u201d \\u201cNo! Fuck you! I\\u2019m leaving you!\\u201d And then she storms out of the room, and then he was like\\u2026 \\u201cYou fucking bitch! [Grunts] I hate you! [Grunting] You will rue the day\\u2026 that you left Oscar Pistorius, the Blade Runner! Don\\u2019t go anywhere! [Grunting] I hate you!\\u201d That\\u2019s where he keeps his legs. All right. Then he put the blades on. \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re in trouble, missy. I tell you. I go to my gun safe.\\u201d She locked herself in the bathroom. He shot her through the bathroom door. Seems like overkill, doesn\\u2019t it? Bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them, but Oscar\\u2019s one of the few men on Earth that couldn\\u2019t kick the door in, right? He was wearing the blades, so\\u2026 Boing! Ah! So\\u2026 I think Oscar will probably go to prison. Now\\u2026 in South Africa, one in four people have AIDS. I assume it may even be worse in the prison population. Now, can I say this? Look\\u2026 I\\u2019ve never raped a man. I hate that I have to put \\u201ca man\\u201d in that sentence, but whatever. I\\u2019ve never raped a man, but\\u2026 if I was going to rape a man, it would be a legless Olympian\\u2026 \\u2019cause in prison, it\\u2019s all about getting one up on other people, and making people think you\\u2019re tough and all that. Like, \\u201cYou want to fucking rape me? I just raped an Olympian, bitch. Is that what you fucking want?\\u201d There\\u2019d be a wonderful moment\\u2026 when you\\u2019re in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a Terminator movie. [Chuckling] You know what I like about that joke? So often when you tell a joke, the rapist is the villain in the story, but not in that one. Not in that one. He\\u2019s the hero. All right, we have to get going soon. Before I leave, \\u2013 I thank you very much for coming. \\u2013 [Audience groaning] No, I said, \\u201csoon,\\u201d not \\u201cover.\\u201d It\\u2019s just soon, you cunts, so calm down. [Chuckles] [Man whistles] I always\\u2026 I always find that weird when someone, like, whistles like that. What do they think is going to happen? Like, I\\u2019m going to go, \\u201cFucking you know me, mate. I was enjoying claps and cheers, but what I needed was a high-pitched squeal noise. Thank God you came along to pick up my spirits.\\u201d [Man] Love you! All right, final story. Now, I was in South Africa again. Jeez, I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ll be working in South Africa after this special comes out. I used to do, like, one tour in South Africa every year, and I just don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019ll be invited this time. They\\u2019ll be like, [In South African accent] \\u201cWe don\\u2019t like him. He\\u2019s no good.\\u201d Anyway, so, I\\u2019m in South Africa, and I had to fly back from Cape Town to Los Angeles, which is, like, a 26-hour flight. You\\u2019ve to go up to London and go across. Cunt of a trip. Um\\u2026 But it was all right \\u2019cause I had a business class ticket, so I didn\\u2019t give a fuck. And when I travel economy, I try to dress up nice \\u2019cause I like to look good in case someone recognizes me and I might get an upgrade. But when I\\u2019ve already got a business class ticket, I try to look like a bag of shit\\u2026 \\u2019cause it\\u2019s important to me that everyone else in business class doesn\\u2019t want me there and they\\u2019re annoyed by my presence. So\\u2026 I\\u2019m wearing a white T-shirt that\\u2019s got brown stains on it with a hole in the side. I\\u2019m wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out. So, anyway, I go up to the counter, up to the business thing with the thing, and I go, \\u201cHello,\\u201d and the lady goes, [In South African accent] \\u201cOh, Mr. Jefferies, I\\u2019m so sorry, but you have been downgraded.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou what now?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cBusiness class is full. You have been downgraded.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI understand that business class is full. I bought one of the tickets that made it full.\\u201d And she went, \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, sir. There\\u2019s nothing I can do.\\u201d And then I just went, \\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\\u201d Now, you know when you\\u2019re dealing with customer service people, and they want you to swear, \\u2019cause as soon as you swear, they don\\u2019t have to engage with you anymore. They can act like they\\u2019re the first adult never to hear a swear word, and they can get really offended, right? So I went, \\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\\u201d And she went, \\u201cPlease do not speak to me that way! I have done nothing wrong!\\u201d And I said, \\u201cAre you, a white South African, telling me you\\u2019ve done nothing wrong?\\u201d Anyway\\u2026 tensions rose. The manager comes over. Big fat cunt called Simon Fulcher, right? He walks over and goes, [In South African accent] \\u201cWhat is wrong here? What is wrong?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI bought a business class ticket and I want a business class ticket.\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cWhat do you want me to do? Make a new chair for you? There are no more seats. I can\\u2019t do anything.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cI\\u2019ll tell you what I can do. Go up to the executive lounge. Have some peanuts. Enjoy a beverage. Listen to Rodriguez, and if something opens up, we will move you back up to business class. So I thought, \\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing I can do.\\u201d So I walk off with my ticket. I\\u2019m walking through the airport like, \\u201cFucking British Airways, bunch of fucking cunts.\\u201d Right? I get up to the counter. And the woman behind the counter said, \\u201cTickets, please.\\u201d And I hand over my ticket and she goes, [In South African accent] \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, sir, but this is for business class passengers only. Your ticket says \\u2018economy\\u2019 on it.\\u201d And I said\\u2026 [Inhales sharply] \\u201cI bought a business class ticket, but you people have downgraded\\u2026\\u201d And as I was doing my little speech, she looked past me and went, \\u201cNext.\\u201d [Audience exclaiming] \\u201cListen here, you fucking cunt.\\u201d [Audience laughing] All right? Now, you say \\u201ccunt\\u201d in any foreign country, people lose their fucking shit. Security came from everywhere. I was going, \\u201cDon\\u2019t you fucking come near me, cunt!\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI want to speak to Simon Fulcher,\\u201d like I\\u2019m\\u2026 And they go, \\u201cAll right.\\u201d They ring the manager up, and then they go\\u2026 He goes, \\u201cIs it the pale Australian man?\\u201d And the guy went, \\u201cYes.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve had problems with him. Let him through.\\u201d Right? So I go through. I\\u2019m sitting there, I\\u2019m eating my peanuts. And I\\u2019m just angry now, going, \\u201cFucking British Airways. Fucking cunts, fucking\\u2026\\u201d Like that. And in walks in a group of Americans, about 30 of them. You know the type, right? They all\\u2026 And whenever I see Americans abroad\\u2026 I\\u2019ll do my impersonation of any American abroad. When Americans are abroad, you\\u2019re just pointing out shit you see. You\\u2019re just walking around going, [In American accent] \\u201cOh, this is great! Look at that. That\\u2019s a chair right there. Okay. Oh, what\\u2019s that over there? Okay. Wonderful. Great.\\u201d Right? And this group walked in, and one of the women in the group went like this, she went, [In American accent] \\u201cDid anyone else see that Australian guy speaking to that lady out there? Some people have no class.\\u201d And I put my head around the pylon, and I went, \\u201cYou can fuck off and all! You don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019ve been through! I\\u2019ve been downgraded!\\u201d And as I said that, 18 other people who were given the same lie that I was given, that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class, the penny dropped. None of us are getting promoted. They all lied to us, and we formed an angry militia in seconds. It was like a scene out of Braveheart, and they all stood up and went, \\u201cFucking downgraded!\\u201d And the woman in the group was doing this, \\u201cDon\\u2019t speak to me that way. Who the hell do you think you are?\\u201d And all the men in the group were like, \\u201cHey, why don\\u2019t you shut the fuck up? Just shut the fuck up.\\u201d \\u266a It doesn\\u2019t matter These people seem very angry, so \\u266a And a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down. And, sometimes, Americans, sometimes, you can seem a little insincere. And he came up and he went, [In American accent] \\u201cHey. Hey. Yeah, I get it. [Exhales sharply] Downgraded, yeah. That really grinds my gears, I tell you that. Yeah, I would write a strongly-worded letter. I really would.\\u201d And then I thought, at least this guy\\u2019s being nice, and I said, \\u201cLook, mate, don\\u2019t worry about it. It\\u2019s not like it\\u2019s your fault.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cWhy are you in such a big group anyway?\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cOh, we\\u2019re in Neil Diamond\\u2019s band. That\\u2019s Neil Diamond\\u2019s backup singer you just called a cunt there.\\u201d And as he said that, Neil Diamond walked around the corner like a fucking superhero\\u2026 and I reacted like he was one. I went, \\u201cNeil Diamond!\\u201d And Neil Diamond went, [In husky voice] \\u201cHey, what\\u2019s going on?\\u201d And then, for a second there, there was a bit of my brain that thought maybe Neil Diamond could solve problems. And I went, \\u201cNeil! Me and all these people, we\\u2019ve been downgraded!\\u201d And Neil went, \\u201cOh! Oh, right. Uh, well, maybe that\\u2019s our fault. We decided to come back a day early.\\u201d \\u201cYou can fuck off and all, Neil Diamond!\\u201d And then a fight breaks out amongst the Neil Diamond band and the downgraded. Punches are thrown. Not by me. I don\\u2019t know if you have the Internet, but I\\u2019m not much of a fighter. I\\u2019m an excellent scurrier-awayer. I get down. \\u201cHey, what have you got there? Hiya!\\u201d Anyway, the airport police came. Three people were arrested from the downgraded\\u2026 but three people were arrested from the Neil Diamond band, and that meant that three seats opened up in business class.

Hi. Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, \\u2019cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming. Um\\u2026 It\\u2019s a very exciting day for me. It\\u2019s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought\\u2026 is \\u201cFuck you.\\u201d \\u201cFuck you. I don\\u2019t even know you, but fuck you!\\u201d \\u2018Cause I\\u2019m straight up jealous. I\\u2019m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there\\u2019s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through. And then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don\\u2019t have insomnia yet. They don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don\\u2019t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It\\u2019s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don\\u2019t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It\\u2019s coming. You don\\u2019t have HPV yet, you\\u2019re a fucking loser, all right? That\\u2019s what that says about you. A lot of men don\\u2019t know that they have HPV, because it\\u2019s undetectable in men. It\\u2019s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men\\u2019s bodies and says, \\u201cBoo!\\u201d in women\\u2019s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that\\u2019s gonna turn into cervical cancer\\u2026 \\u2026or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I\\u2019m gonna die\\u2026 or you\\u2019re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We\\u2019ll find out. Um, I can also tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I\\u2019m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I\\u2019m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that\\u2019s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That\\u2019s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I\\u2019m a horrible person, I\\u2019m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I\\u2019m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I\\u2019m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator\\u2019s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, \\u2019cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you\\u2019re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don\\u2019t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82\\u2026 manual. The manual. She don\\u2019t even know\\u2026 where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don\\u2019t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson\\u2019s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, \\u201cYou never know when you might need this.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cBut\\u2026 I do know\\u2026 that I\\u2019m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.\\u201d \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that\\u2019s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.\\u201d I grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I\\u2019m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They\\u2019re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he\\u2019s\\u2013 he\\u2019s much better looking than me, he\\u2019s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, who is that?\\u201d And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, I\\u2019m gonna trap his ass.\\u201d \\u201cGoing to trap his ass!\\u201d And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, \\u201cAll right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.\\u201d When, really, it\\u2019s a public park\\u2026 \\u2026that has hosted many reggae fests\\u2026 \\u2026and has even accidentally let\\u2026 two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing\\u2026 for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to\\u2026 It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had\\u2026 We had so much chemistry. He was like, \\u201cHey, wassup?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWassup?\\u201d And we\\u2013 The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, \\u201cHey, can you drop me off?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhere?\\u201d He was like, \\u201cAt the park.\\u201d And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, \\u201cOh, no!\\u201d \\u201cI just fucked a homeless dude! Again!\\u201d My husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It\\u2019s\\u2026 too much. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very\\u2026 You feel very picturesque when you\\u2019re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you\\u2019re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it\\u2019s very, you know, it\\u2019s hot hookin\\u2019 up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I\\u2019m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement\\u2026 \\u2026you know, just right there, through the money hole and just\\u2026 And then also, he\\u2019s so vulnerable down there. I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cI could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!\\u201d You know? But I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home\\u2026 and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don\\u2019t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It\\u2019s\\u2026 amazing. It\\u2019s what love is built on, you know? My last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, \\u201cHold it. You guys aren\\u2019t Mexican?\\u201d Asian-American men are very underrated. I don\\u2019t know why people don\\u2019t go for them. They\\u2019re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It\\u2019s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It\\u2019s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It\\u2019s all red and inflamed and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI did not ask to be exfoliated today.\\u201d \\u201cThis is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.\\u201d And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That\\u2019s where the umami flavor comes from. I think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he\\u2019s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we\\u2019re both half-fancy Asian\\u2026 \\u2026and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn\\u2019t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!\\u201d I was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not authentic, OK?\\u201d You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, \\u2019cause it don\\u2019t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused. I grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That\\u2019s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that\\u2019s like\\u2026 \\u2026a thousand percent of your daily fiber\\u2026 and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about\\u2026 \\u2026supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it\\u2019s funny, right, because he\\u2019s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do\\u2026 makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall\\u2026 and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house. Him and I had been dating for four years and I\\u2013 I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose\\u2026 because\\u2026 I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women\\u2019s intuition. That\\u2019s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man\\u2019s head. First passively and then if he doesn\\u2019t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you\\u2019re too old and it\\u2019s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, \\u201cShut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?\\u201d And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, \\u201cOh, my God! He proposed!\\u201d \\u201cIt came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something\\u2026 that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.\\u201d Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page\\u2026 he\\u2019s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday\\u2026 because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That\\u2019s how rotten I was. People are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I\\u2019m a completely different person. You\\u2013 Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I\\u2019m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We\\u2019ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I\\u2019ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he\\u2019d become dependent on me. \\u2018Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t. I straight up don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\\u2019ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she\\u2019s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don\\u2019t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re dumb women. We don\\u2019t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.\\u201d \\u201c\\u2018Cause we\\u2019re too stupid to have any real responsibility.\\u201d And then, all these women had to show off and be like, \\u201cWe could do it! We could do anything.\\u201d \\u201cBitch, shut up!\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t tell them the secret.\\u201d They ruined it for us, and now we\\u2019re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, \\u201cDouble-income household,\\u201d I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cBut, Ali, we have so many more options now.\\u201d Oh, you don\\u2019t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it? A lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they\\u2019ll get very judgmental about housewives that we\\u2019ll see on the street. And they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cLook at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat bitch is a genius.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s not a housewife, she\\u2019s retired.\\u201d I do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It\\u2019s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it\\u2019s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don\\u2019t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don\\u2019t gotta\\u2026 \\u2026ten times a day, every day\\u2026 like you\\u2019re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don\\u2019t gotta do that. They don\\u2019t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that\\u2019s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It\\u2019s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired \\u2019cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed \\u2019cause you\\u2019re paranoid that your co-worker\\u2019s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, no! Courtney\\u2019s listening. She\\u2019s waiting. She\\u2019s timing me.\\u201d And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it\\u2019s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don\\u2019t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don\\u2019t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don\\u2019t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want. You know, it\\u2019s\\u2013 it\\u2019s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, \\u201cYou need to get to work on time.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYou need to eat bananas.\\u201d \\u201cI saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don\\u2019t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.\\u201d My father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, \\u201cHey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhy you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don\\u2019t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, \\u2018I do,\\u2019 what I really meant was, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019m done.'\\u201d I\\u2019m done. I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore and I\\u2019m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I\\u2019ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That\\u2019s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just\\u2026 Let\\u2019s redecorate. I gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I\\u2019m a\\u2013 I\\u2019m a disgusting pervert. I\\u2019m a pervert. I\\u2019m a gross filthy animal. And I think it\\u2019s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that\\u2026 y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it\\u2019s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you. I broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, \\u201cUh, you\\u2019re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist\\u2026 and posted \\u2018Tiny Asian female seeking anal\\u2026\\u2019 the Internet would crash.\\u201d \\u201cAnd all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.\\u201d They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know\\u2026 freaked out about anal. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, I don\\u2019t wanna do that. I\\u2019m scared of\\u2013 of the pain.\\u201d You ain\\u2019t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You\\u2019re not scared of the pain. What you\\u2019re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You\\u2019re scared that he\\u2019s gonna see that and that\\u2019s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can\\u2019t help you now. But don\\u2019t worry, \\u2019cause when he puts it in the butt, all he\\u2019s thinking about is, \\u201cI just put it in her butt.\\u201d \\u201cI gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.\\u201d You\\u2019re\\u2013 If you\\u2019re married, you\\u2019re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don\\u2019t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you\\u2019ll feel like you\\u2019re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I\\u2019m a little bit\\u2026 \\u2026stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, \\u201cOh, my God! It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m going back in time!\\u201d \\u266a A whole new world \\u266a It was magical. A big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to\\u2026 Now, if you haven\\u2019t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your\\u2013 Just give your man a little\\u2013 a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you\\u2019ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You\\u2019ll get a lot of \\u201cNo! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don\\u2019t\\u2013 No! I don\\u2019t! I don\\u2019t! No!\\u201d They get all squirmy wormy because\\u2026 they\\u2019re scared. They\\u2019re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they\\u2019re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man\\u2019s eye like he\\u2019s discovered nirvana. And it\\u2019s like you\\u2019re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know? My husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When\\u2013 When I\\u2019ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. \\u201cHey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?\\u201d I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cYes, I know you respect me and that\\u2019s why you need to abuse me. OK?\\u201d \\u2018Cause it\\u2019s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their\\u2013 Glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 It\\u2019s because we\\u2019re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t wanna die! Don\\u2019t kill me! I don\\u2019t wanna die!\\u201d But I also don\\u2019t want to be sure that I\\u2019m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just\\u2013 Just choke me enough so that I can\\u2019t talk. \\u2018Cause if I can talk, I\\u2019m gonna tell you what to do. And I\\u2019m tired of being the boss. I\\u2019m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I\\u2019m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it. Sheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word \\u201cbossy\\u201d in elementary schools, because according to her, it\\u2019s sexist to use the word \\u201cbossy,\\u201d because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re bossy,\\u201d you\\u2019re supposed to say, \\u201cYou have executive leadership skills.\\u201d Which is a very roundabout way of saying: \\u201cYou\\u2019re a little cunt.\\u201d I\\u2019m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I\\u2019m talking about? I\\u2019m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That\\u2019s the kind of income bracket I\\u2019m striving for. That\\u2019s when you know you\\u2019ve made it, when you\\u2019re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango\\u2026 \\u2026Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess. I have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran. So, I don\\u2019t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It\\u2019s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics\\u2026 don\\u2019t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There\\u2019s\\u2013 None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That\\u2019s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they\\u2019ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cGuys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby\\u2019s a little piece of shit. It\\u2019s so annoying and boring.\\u201d And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s hilarious. I identify.\\u201d And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper \\u2019cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby\\u2019s head shredding it up. She\\u2019s busy. So, I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, \\u201cAli, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become\\u2013 You\\u2019re gonna disappear, and you\\u2019re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s the dream.\\u201d That\\u2019s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know? Another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, \\u201cWhy are you gonna have a kid? Why don\\u2019t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s cool\\u2026 until my husband dies.\\u201d Which he\\u2019s definitely gonna before me. Because I\\u2019m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I\\u2019m a billion. I\\u2019m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase \\u201cblack don\\u2019t crack.\\u201d Well, Asian don\\u2019t die. We don\\u2019t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we\\u2019re such bad drivers? Because we\\u2019re trying to die. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!\\u201d \\u201cImma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna make a right turn\\u2013 I changed my mind, it\\u2019s a U-turn!\\u201d \\u201cI changed my mind again. It\\u2019s a O-turn!\\u201d Every time I get into a car accident\\u2026 \\u2026I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, my God, not again!\\u201d I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn\\u2019t see that it\\u2019s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There\\u2019s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there\\u2019s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with me, but I\\u2019m still here, you know? I need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It\\u2019s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. \\u2018Cause she knows that she\\u2019s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I\\u2019m just kidding. She doesn\\u2019t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I\\u2019m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn\\u2019t around to support me anymore. I\\u2019m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That\\u2019s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don\\u2019t give a fuck. They got no shame. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna recycle\\u2026 go bald\\u2026 go to the park, do this shit.\\u201d They do that \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a free activity. For them. They do it in their\\u2013 their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who\\u2019s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity. I also decided to have a kid because uh, I\\u2019m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it\\u2013 And it scared me. Like, I\\u2019m only 33 and\\u2026 \\u2026my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It\\u2019s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just\\u2026 \\u201cI slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what kind of mother I\\u2019m gonna be. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that\\u2026 is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker\\u2019s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. \\u201cUh, mmm.\\u201d They watch Property Brothers, scratch, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s crackin\\u2019? Mmm.\\u201d Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, \\u201cWhen can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026smell my fingers?\\u201d Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, \\u2019cause you gotta check that it\\u2019s all good in the hood. If it\\u2019s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD. When my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, \\u201cOh, my God, that\\u2019s so hot. You guys doin\\u2019 a lot of fuckin\\u2019?\\u201d No, dude. That\\u2019s\\u2013 That\\u2019s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in\\u2013 When you\\u2019re in your 30s, and you\\u2019ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin\\u2019. It tells you when it\\u2019s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not fuckin\\u2019. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it\\u2019s like, \\u2018Release the Kraken!'\\u201d And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um\\u2026 yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn\\u2019t even have sex, \\u2019cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cOK, it\\u2019s go time,\\u201d and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s not because they\\u2019re in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s because they\\u2019re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn\\u2019t have to see the expression on my face that says, \\u201cPlease, hurry the fuck up.\\u201d And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It\\u2019s when they get that\\u2026 that stupid-ass look on their face\\u2026 \\u2026where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just\\u2026 And then, because we\\u2019re hippies, I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cHey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?\\u201d And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him\\u2026 and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards\\u2026 to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That\\u2019s right. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\\u2019m very grateful to be pregnant and to be\\u2026 this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, my God. That\\u2019s so dark and terrible. I can\\u2019t believe that.\\u201d I\\u2019m 33. Girl, when you\\u2019re 33, you\\u2019ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It\\u2019s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn\\u2019t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom\\u2013 She\\u2019s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, \\u201cUh, yeah. Where I\\u2019m from, that\\u2019s like losing a pair of shoes. It\\u2019s whatevs, OK?\\u201d And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, \\u201cOh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you\\u2019re having twins.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo!\\u201d And then she said, \\u201cBut what I don\\u2019t see is a heartbeat.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cYes!\\u201d \\u201cThe Lord is mysterious!\\u201d Don\\u2019t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I\\u2019ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won\\u2019t let their husbands watch when they\\u2019re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, \\u201cYou look.\\u201d \\u201cYou watch the whole thing.\\u201d And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyonc\\u00e9. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That\\u2019s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted. I\\u2019m scared about giving childbirth, though. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m very, very scared of childbirth. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That\\u2019s a white hippie witch\\u2026 \\u2026that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser S\\u00f6ze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, \\u201cAli, did you know that you\\u2019re gonna poop on the table?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, I look forward to it.\\u201d I\\u2019m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can\\u2019t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you\\u2013 that that happens because when you\\u2019re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that\\u2019s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That\\u2019s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn\\u2019t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. \\u201cHey, can you wash the dishes?\\u201d \\u201cNo!\\u201d \\u201cCan you water the plants?\\u201d \\u201cI am not doing jack shit anymore. I\\u2019m busy makin\\u2019 a eyeball, OK? Are you makin\\u2019 a foot? I didn\\u2019t think so. You change the channel.\\u201d I can already see how there\\u2019s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor\\u2019s appointments with me. \\u201cOh, my God. I can\\u2019t believe he comes to all your doctor\\u2019s appointments. He is so supportive.\\u201d Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I\\u2019m the star of the show. There\\u2019s nothing for the camera to see if I\\u2019m not there. But he\\u2019s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I\\u2019m a bad mommy. You know, I\\u2013 I\\u2013 I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I\\u2019m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis\\u2026 to keep him down so that he doesn\\u2019t believe that he\\u2019s worthy of another woman\\u2019s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don\\u2019t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn\\u2019t know that. I didn\\u2019t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big\\u2013 they get big, like fingers. Like, \\u201cYou, you. You owe me money, you.\\u201d My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I\\u2019m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it. Now that I\\u2019m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy\\u2019s all wet again. But it\\u2019s different. It\\u2019s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, \\u201cWhy is it different?\\u201d And I looked it up, and my pussy\\u2019s all wet again because my\\u2013 my body\\u2019s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That\\u2019s not the same. When it\\u2019s straight up soldier glue, when it\\u2019s Neosporin. So, you know, I\\u2013 I, in\\u2013 previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who\\u2019s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he\\u2019s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron\\u2019d my ass. And now, if I don\\u2019t work, we die. Why else do you think I\\u2019m performing seven and a half months pregnant? All right, I\\u2019ve been Ali Wong.

Thanks. Thank you, guys. Hey, Seattle. Nice to see you. Look at this. Look at us. We\\u2019re here. This is crazy. It\\u2019s insane. So about five years ago, pretty much everyone who I know started to get married, and that was strange for me because I don\\u2019t really believe in the idea of marriage. And that would have been fine, except I have a problem where sometimes when I think that I am right about something, it can be a real source of tension between me and the person I\\u2019m arguing with. And the reason it\\u2019s a source of tension is that I\\u2019m right. And so I remember distinctly talking to my friend Dana, and she goes, \\u201cWell, you don\\u2019t believe in marriage for you, but, of course, you believe in it for other people.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo, I think it\\u2019s insane, you know, for anyone.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cWhy?\\u201d\\nAnd I said, \\u201cWell, first of all, it just seems doomed.\\u201d You know, 50% of marriages end in divorce. That\\u2019s just first marriages, by the way. Second marriages, 60% to 62% end in divorce. Third marriages, 70% to 75% end in divorce. That\\u2019s a learning curve.\\nSecond of all, monogamy\\u2019s impossible, or at the very least, not a sure thing. When I say that, I think people assume that I\\u2019m implying that men are incapable of being faithful. I think women are just as incapable, but for more sophisticated reasons, you know. I mean, with men, we\\u2019re just really simple. We have a very simple sexuality. When I say that, my female friends are like, \\u201cWell, we like sex just as much as you do.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cSure, but it\\u2019s different.\\u201d And they say, \\u201cHow?\\u201d And I say, \\u201cHave you ever masturbated while driving a car?\\u201d\\nNumber three\\u2026 I\\u2019m never gonna be happy. Why would anyone want to be a part of that? I think that\\u2019s not brought up often enough. I, um, I didn\\u2019t know that would be the reaction. Oh, no, that\\u2019s the hopeful part. The, uh\\u2026 I had one ally in all this, which is my friend Andy, and he\\u2019s a comedian as well. Not only did we decide we weren\\u2019t gonna get married, we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married. Yeah, we were pretty good at it. Like, we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages, you know. We were\\u2026 we were pretty good. I mean, we weren\\u2019t like the best in the world. I\\u2019m sure there are better in Europe. But we were\\u2026 we were solid, you know. Like, so, like, for example, at point my friend Alex was about to get engaged. And so we just took him to dinner. And during dessert, we gave him a long, hard stare. We said, \\u201cAre you sure this is what you want to do?\\u201d And then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we weren\\u2019t friends anymore. So February 27, 2007, I\\u2019m at Andy\\u2019s house in Los Angeles. And earlier in the night, I got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone, and it was a bad one because I knew that I was right. And Andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation \\u2019cause he\\u2019s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether you\\u2019re right. He says stuff like, \\u201cShe sounds crazy.\\u201d Like, even if what she\\u2019s saying isn\\u2019t that crazy, like, you\\u2019d be like, \\u201cShe only eats whole wheat bagels.\\u201d He\\u2019d be like, \\u201cShe sounds crazy!\\u201d You\\u2019d be like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not even the crazy part!\\u201d You know. So I\\u2019m telling him about his argument. And he goes, \\u201cYou\\u2019re right.\\u201d I go, \\u201cI know. I\\u2019m right.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cYeah, you\\u2019re right.\\u201d I go, \\u201cI know I\\u2019m right. I got to tell her about this in the morning.\\u201d And I get in my rental car to head back to my hotel, and I\\u2019m driving out of Andy\\u2019s small road, and I\\u2019m t-boned! I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019re familiar with this term, uh\\u2026 This is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driver\\u2019s side at a 90-degree angle, like a t-bone steak. And in 1 1/2 seconds, I\\u2019m spun around, and I think I\\u2019m dead. No, wait, I\\u2019m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. And then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. I know. Let me tell you how this argument started. I met Jenny in St. Louis. My friend Andy and I were working for her company. They were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches, which is really my demographic. I, uh\\u2026 No, I was very nervous about this. I was actually kind of about to go onstage, and I was, like, scrawling notes on my napkin. A lot of times I\\u2019ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary. And Jenny looked at me, and she goes, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI\\u2019m writing my set list.\\u201d And then she goes, \\u201cI think it\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo, it won\\u2019t be fine.\\u201d And then she was like, \\u201cI think it will be okay.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cWhy do you think that?\\u201d And she said, \\u201cWell, you look so nervous, I think they\\u2019ll feel sorry for you.\\u201d But Jenny has this really soft, sweet voice, like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything. At one point, she said, \\u201cIt seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage.\\u201d Normally, I\\u2019d be offended by that, but in this instance, I was like, \\u201cYou are right. That is a great point. You are beautiful, you know.\\u201d She re\\u2026 she really was. You know, from the moment I met Jenny, I knew I wanted to sleep with her at least once. Stay with me. Uh, I mean\\u2026 I mean that in, like, in the most meaningful way. Like, that was the most that I was capable of in my life at that point. I\\u2026 I\\u2019d jus\\u2026 I\\u2019d just come off a really long, difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married, and\\u2026 and then we weren\\u2019t. And then when we weren\\u2019t, I was so heartbroken, I just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely, you know, and\\u2026 But from the moment I met Jenny, I just wanted to be with her. And I didn\\u2019t\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t think it was gonna happen. Like, I don\\u2019t have that kind of confidence. I actually think of myself as a sex maybe, which is to say that if I\\u2019m seeing a girl, she\\u2019d think, \\u201cI\\u2019d have sex with him, maybe.\\u201d You know, and I\\u2019m\\u2026 I\\u2019m not ashamed of that. There were periods in my life where I was a sex never. Or a sex with self always. Yeah. And often. Surprisingly often. Yeah, I just don\\u2019t give off a great first impression. Like, I\\u2019ll give you an example. Like, this is the shirt I decided to wear tonight. Like, I didn\\u2019t\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt. I mean, this is my \\u201cA\\u201d outfit. My \\u201cB\\u201d outfit was naked. I like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that I might be a fixer-upper. I\\u2019ve reached this point in my life I don\\u2019t really look in the mirror before I leave my apartment. I glance at it to make sure I\\u2019m not bleeding. You know what I mean? Like\\u2026 But I don\\u2019t stare at the mirror. If I stare at the mirror, I get angry. Like, I feel like I\\u2019m complaining about a bad call a ref just made. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cCome on!\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re blind if you\\u2019re leaving the house like that!\\u201d And the ref is God, and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline. And it\\u2019s a close game \\u2019cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast, and I\\u2019m all riled up. I\\u2019m about to charge the field. And the guy comes by with fried dough. And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNext time.\\u201d You know, that\\u2019s how I go for fried dough, \\u2019cause I have a problem. I just\\u2026 This is ridiculous. Can you follow me over here for a second? I\\u2019m gonna jump off stage. This is only in Seattle where someone is wearing no shoes? No shoes or socks? What? Who are you people? What is wrong with you? I would expect that behavior from this guy, but not you, sir, not you! What is this? Where do you think you are? From Seattle! Yeah, Seattle. So I\\u2019ve been going, uh, recently to a women\\u2019s exercise class. I-I\\u2019ve given up on having a traditional male physique. And so now I\\u2019m going for strong, independent woman. And, uh\\u2026 It\\u2019s going pretty well, you know. I\\u2019m not as good in the class as you might think. Sometimes I\\u2019ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isn\\u2019t looking. But then when she looks over, I always have to strike a pose as though I\\u2019ve been doing what everybody else has been doing. It reminds me of the Olympics. You know how they do gymnastics, how they\\u2019ll have those\\u2026 The girls will do those crazy flips and twirls. And every once in a while\\u2026 And I\\u2019m not saying I root for this to happen, but sometimes they\\u2019ll fall, and it\\u2019s ugly \\u2019cause they\\u2019re rolling around like, \\u201cI\\u2019m in a lot of trouble. Like, I don\\u2019t even know how I got here.\\u201d But at the end of that, no matter what\\u2026 And I totally fall for it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cthat can\\u2019t possibly be the same loser \\u201cFrom moments ago. \\u201cI mean, that\\u2019s a completely different person. \\u201cThis person has much better posture, for starters.\\u201d I really wanted Jenny to come out with me and Andy that night in St. Louis \\u2019cause we were going out to one of these famous Irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak. And so I thought that might work to my advantage. I don\\u2019t know, and, uh\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t have the nerve to ask her myself, and so I convinced Andy to ask her for us. And, uh\\u2026 Pfft. Which\\u2026 yeah, I don\\u2019t know if that was the best idea \\u2019cause, uh, we\\u2019re heading\\u2026 We\\u2019re in the car heading to the pub, and Jenny says, \\u201cOh, I left my I.D. at the hotel.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cOh, we can just swing back and get it.\\u201d And she\\u2019s like\\u2026 she\\u2019s like, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cNo, it won\\u2019t be fine \\u2019cause it\\u2019s St. Patrick\\u2019s day, and there\\u2019s bouncers.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019ll be okay.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo, it won\\u2019t be okay.\\u201d And then we get to the pub, and it was fine. Like, the bouncer just kind of waved her through, which has not been my experience with bouncers. For me, bouncers are like prison guards. And for Jenny, they\\u2019re like birthday clowns like, you know, \\u201cWhat can I do to make your day better?\\u201d\\nYou know, and that\\u2019s\\u2026 We\\u2019re at the pub, and it had taken so much convincing for Andy to get Jenny to come out there. By the time she came out, she thought she was on a date with him. And, yeah, that wasn\\u2019t the idea. And so I said\\u2026 I had to convince him to fall away as the night went on, like the red rockets on the space shuttle. And eventually, she realized she was on a date with me, and she was not happy about that. But, uh\\u2026 But she warmed to me as the night went on \\u2019cause she was drinking, and then, like\\u2026 No, by the end of the night, we were laughing and having a good time, and we\\u2026 I caught a break, which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends, and she and I were stuffed in this little back seat together. And it was really quiet, so I could hear her soft voice. And she told me she had just come off a long, difficult breakup, and I told her about my breakup. And for a moment there in the back seat, it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart, and\\u2026 We get back to the hotel, and I offer to walk her to her room, and she says, \\u201cSure.\\u201d We get to her door, and I didn\\u2019t want this night to end. And so I build up the courage to lean in to kiss her, and she says, \\u201cOh, no, thank you.\\u201d Which I thought was polite\\u2026 But disappointing. I mean, there\\u2019s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because you\\u2019re really putting yourself out there. You\\u2019re just like, \\u201cI think we should connect mouths,\\u201d you know, and\\u2026 The other person\\u2019s like, \\u201cI do not think we should connect mouths.\\u201d And those are\\u2026 They\\u2019re two very different mouth agendas, you know. And then you just feel so stupid. You\\u2019re like, \\u201cI never should have suggested we connect mouths, you know.\\u201d This is a sore subject for me. I have sort of a long history of failed kisses. Like, I\\u2026 I remember growing up, like, when people started making out. Like, in my time in Massachusetts, it was in seventh grade. I remember\\u2026 I remember it like it was yesterday \\u2019cause I was shocked. I was like, \\u201cPeople we know are just making out with other people we know?\\u201d \\u201cBut how?\\u201d You know. It seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden. I was like, \\u201cI am not doing that.\\u201d And collectively, all the girls in my class were like, \\u201cThat is fine. \\u201cYou are not on the list. \\u201cYou\\u2019re not exactly a first-round draft pick for our new activity.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cPerfect.\\u201d It seemed so gross to me. And it still does kind of. Like, sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t like when I see two dudes making out in the street.\\u201d And I feel that way about anyone. Like, making out is just sloppy. It\\u2019s like watching a dog eat spaghetti. That\\u2019s how I make out. Is that right? Does anybody know if that\\u2019s right? Okay, good. So\\u2026 In seventh grade, I was like, \\u201cI\\u2019m not gonna make out with anybody.\\u201d And that was fine for a while, but increasingly, it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts. It was like, the make-out club and the non-make-out club. And these were informal organizations, of course. I mean, I would be sad if that were school-sanctioned, like, \\u201cwe call this meeting of the non-make-out club to order. \\u201cFirst order of business, Nintendo. \\u201cSecond order of business, why doesn\\u2019t anyone like us? Meeting adjourned.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know, it was a sad group, and we were losing good guys by the day. I feared\\u2026 I feared that soon I would be the lone member of the non-make-out club, so I was like, \\u201cI got to try to get into the make-out club.\\u201d But it was a very intangible goal. I didn\\u2019t really talk to a lot of girls, and\\u2026 There was one girl who sat in front of me in class named Lisa Bazetti who I had a huge crush on, but she was way out of my league. Like, she had many suitors. She had\\u2026 I don\\u2019t\\u2026 The rest of the show is in old English. Uh\\u2026 She doth had many suitors! Uh, no, she had many, you know, admirers. And there were three of us, really, and I was in third place in all the trade publications, but I had one advantage over these other guys, which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework, thanks to alphabetical order. Bazetti, Birbiglia. One time I said something on the phone that made her laugh, and I was like, \\u201cOh, this is great. I got to do that more.\\u201d And one time we were on the phone, and she was laughing so hard, I remember so well \\u2019cause she goes, \\u201cMike, you got to stop. I\\u2019m gonna pee myself.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cWow.\\u201d This was the closest I\\u2019d ever come to a vagina. So spent the next 15 years trying to get Lisa Bazetti to pee. And that\\u2019s how I ended up here. Yeah. That\\u2019s how we all ended up here, in a sense. So\\u2026 uh\\u2026 So here\\u2019s what happened with Lisa. One time I built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me, and she said yes. I couldn\\u2019t believe it. Like, all of a sudden I thought, \\u201cWell, maybe this will be like \\u201cone of those romantic comedy montages. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll go to the carnival, we\\u2019ll get stuck \\u201cOn the top of the Ferris wheel, we\\u2019ll make out. \\u201cIt\\u2019ll all take a minute and a half, and it will be set to Phil Collins song.\\u201d But I think that when you\\u2019re 12 years old, you just don\\u2019t understand certain things about your digestive system. You don\\u2019t know that you shouldn\\u2019t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler. Cotton candy being the most insane of these items. It\\u2019s basically saying, \\u201cWe\\u2019re gonna take sugar, \\u201cwhich everyone knows is bad, but then we\\u2019ll dress it up like insulation.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure \\u201cwhat the selling point is there. Is it the sugar or the insulation?\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe already sold it.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cwell done, way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know if you have the scrambler here in Seattle. I imagine you might. It travels on a truck. It is a very mobile scrambling unit. The premise is very simple. You just sit on a two-person pod with the person you are in love with, and that pod goes in a circle, which is part of a larger circle, which is part of an even grander circle. As I understand it, it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients. It was called the \\u201cshits of pants-erator,\\u201d and it was wildly successful. And then it was co-opted by the carnival workers of America. Cwoa. And they said\\u2026 They said, \\u201cWe like it, but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff.\\u201d And then one guy says, \\u201cWell, what about the \\u2018I think I\\u2019m gonna die-erator\\u2019?\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s good, \\u201c\\u2019cause it gets across the essence of how you feel \\u201cwhen you\\u2019re on the machine. \\u201cPlus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea, \\u201cwhich is a nice homage \\u201cto the original intention of the machine, \\u201cbut we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff.\\u201d And then one guy goes, \\u201cwell, what about the scrambler? \\u2018Cause it scrambles you!\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe get it, Frank, but who\\u2026\\u201d Frank is a maniac. This guy can\\u2019t be stopped, but every once in a while, he\\u2019s got a good idea. \\u201cBut who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment?\\u201d And this one guy goes, \\u201cwell, I have a nephew who\\u2019s 16 years old \\u201cand smokes pot 24 hours a day. I feel like he might be available.\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201che sounds amazing. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t even need to interview him. He sounds completely qualified.\\u201d\\nI sit down with Lisa on the scrambler, and I\\u2019m feeling good. Like, she\\u2019s snuggling up close to me, and I\\u2019m thinking\\u2026 I\\u2019m thinking like, \\u201cthis could be it. \\u201cThis could be where it\\u2019s all gonna happen. This is very special.\\u201d And then they put that bar seat belt down. And the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment. It\\u2019s not a Ralph Nader approved item. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s saved lives. I think the only thing it\\u2019s ever done is in a scrambler accident, it\\u2019s just sort of held someone\\u2019s esophagus down to the pavement, making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident. First rule of scrambler accident, don\\u2019t talk about scrambler accident. That\\u2019s from scrambler club. Well, I knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that I was going to throw up for sure. And I even said to the 16-year-old stoner, I was like, \\u201chey, actually\\u2026\\u201d And then he was gone. Apparently, he doesn\\u2019t enjoy the second halves of sentences.\\nSo then I\\u2019m scrambling, and\\u2026 As I am scrambling, I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cI need to come up with a plan of some kind. I\\u2019m not going down without a fight.\\u201d My first plan was very simple. It was just don\\u2019t look at Lisa, don\\u2019t look at any other people. I was like, \\u201cdon\\u2019t look at Lisa, \\u201cdon\\u2019t look at any other people. \\u201cDon\\u2019t look at Lisa, \\u201cdon\\u2019t look at any other people. I need a new plan.\\u201d And\\u2026 The new plan was I needed to tell the scrambler operator\\u2026 That he needed to stop the ride, but\\u2026 The mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window. So I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI got to tell him he\\u2019s got to stop the ride. \\u201cI got to tell him he\\u2019s got to stop the ride. \\u201cI got to tell him he\\u2019s got to stop the ride. Please stop the ride!\\u201d And I\\u2019m back! \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure he heard me. \\u201cI got to say it louder. Please stop the ride! \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure he\\u2019s paying attention. I think he might be smoking pot right now.\\u201d The third time I said, \\u201cplease stop.\\u201d And then I started throwing up, and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler, just\\u2026 Popcorn, peanuts\\u2026 Insulation. Really, insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa. I did not look at Lisa. But I\\u2019m pretty sure she was staring at me because I was a spectacle at that point. I was spectacular. And we did not make out. I did not lose my mouth virginity that evening. Two years later, it gets worse. Um\\u2026 I\\u2019m at the St. John\\u2019s high school, what they call a cattle call dance. This is an all boys catholic school I attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty St. John\\u2019s gymnasium like cattle, which is a friendly way to describe women, you know. So\\u2026 Cattle shows up at 8:00. We\\u2019ll make out with the cattle. Cattle goes home at 10:00. Then we go out for burgers. Completely separate from the cattle analogy. It was a horrible affair. It was just like this room chock-full of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out. At this point, I was, indeed, the lone member of the non-make-out club, but it was actually worse than that \\u2019cause I had to lie to my friends and tell them I had had my first kiss \\u2019cause it was, like, this really tough, all boys school. And so when they would ask, like, \\u201coh, have you had your first kiss?\\u201d I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cyeah, like, all the time. Like, every\\u2026 every week.\\u201d I always feared at some point there\\u2019d be a follow-up question like, \\u201coh, yeah? What\\u2019s it like?\\u201d And I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cyeah, you know, it\\u2019s just like licking an ice cream cone.\\u201d And they\\u2019d be like, \\u201cno, it\\u2019s not. It\\u2019s like sucking on a rocket pop.\\u201d And I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cah, wrong frozen dessert analogy.\\u201d I\\u2019m at the dance, and I\\u2019m flanked by my friend Sam Ricciardi. And we\\u2019re introduced by our friend Tom to these girls from his town. They were the last two cows at the dance. They were like, \\u201cmoo!\\u201d And we were like, \\u201cmoo!\\u201d And then Sam says one of these phrases I think we\\u2019ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat. He says, \\u201cyou get that one.\\u201d Which I know it\\u2019s the worst turn of phrase, but I\\u2019m comfortable saying it \\u2019cause I know I\\u2019ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me, \\u201cyou get that one.\\u201d And then her friend goes like, \\u201coof.\\u201d You know, or even worse\\u2026 or even worse, like, \\u201cyou owe me,\\u201d which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance. I would hate to hurt someone\\u2019s credit score, you know. So he goes\\u2026 he goes, \\u201cyou get that one.\\u201d And then I\\u2019m just fast dancing with this girl, Sandra, to young mc\\u2019s bust a move. And I\\u2019m not great at fast dancing, but they had the strobe light going, so it\\u2019s only catching me one out of every five\\u2026 Hey! So she\\u2019s losing interest, but at 1/5 the speed. And then I\\u2019m saved by a slow song, Stairway to Heaven, which is a classic make-out anthem. Led Zeppelin, eight minutes long. What\\u2019s great about slow dancing is you can\\u2019t really mess it up \\u2019cause it\\u2019s just sort of a slow-motion hug. Like, the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it. She\\u2019d be like, \\u201cwhat are you doing?\\u201d And I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t pick up on social cues,\\u201d you know. But it\\u2019s such a long song, you know, Stairway, so I\\u2019m just trying not to fidget. I\\u2019m sort of a fidgety person. I feared if I fidgeted too much, I might initiate the head tilt too early. I didn\\u2019t know anything about making out, but I\\u2019d seen people do it. I could see there\\u2019s, like, a head tilt. I had heard there were tongues involved. And I could see that there was, like, some kind of space in between the two mouths. To me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing. What is happening in that space? There is no\\u2026 You know, there\\u2019s no video documentation of that area. It\\u2019s like the giant squid of making out. No one has seen it alive. They\\u2019ve only seen it washed up on the shore\\u2026 Which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy, but\\u2026 So I\\u2019m trying not to fidget. Then with 1 1/2 minutes left in stairway to heaven, the song hits that crescendo\\u2026 All around me, kids start to make the tilt. Just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me. And I was like, \\u201coh, no. I don\\u2019t want to be alone anymore.\\u201d And I make the slightest tilt. And then Sandra comes in strong, and then it\\u2019s an all-out mouth war. And she had artillery \\u2019cause she had braces. It was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork. As this oral atrocity is taking place, all I can think is, \\u201cI\\u2019m not alone anymore! I\\u2019m not in the non-make-out club!\\u201d And all I wanted to do was tell my friends, but I couldn\\u2019t because up until that point, I\\u2019d lied and said that I\\u2019d had my first kiss. I walked off the dance floor, Sam was like, \\u201chow\\u2019d it go, dude?\\u201d I had to be like, \\u201csame as always. Pretty smooth.\\u201d As the week wore on, I started to convince myself, \\u201cwell, maybe it did go well, \\u201cand I should call Sandra, and this could bud into a relationship of some kind,\\u201d but\\u2026 I got her number from Tom, and those conversations ended up being very brief, you know. We didn\\u2019t have a lot to talk about. I remember just being like, \\u201chey, you like full house? \\u201cMe neither. Cool. All right. Later.\\u201d You know what I mean? At certain points, I remember getting this vibe from her, kind of like, \\u201cwhy are you calling me?\\u201d And I remember thinking, \\u201coh, I\\u2019m probably reading into that one too much,\\u201d and\\u2026 And then she stopped calling me back. And I was like, \\u201coh, yeah, I read into that one perfectly.\\u201d But I just felt so dumb about the whole thing, and the worst part is I couldn\\u2019t even tell my friends, until one day I was\\u2026 I was standing by my locker with my friend Tom, and so I said to him, I was like, \\u201chey, what\\u2019s going on with Sandra? Like, she hasn\\u2019t called me back.\\u201d And Tom has this knowing grin on his face. I was like, \\u201cwhat?\\u201d Tom was like, \\u201cnothing.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cwhat?\\u201d Tom was like, \\u201cnothing.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cwhat?\\u201d Tom\\u2019s like, \\u201coh.\\u201d \\u201cI talked to Sandra, and she said \\u201cyou\\u2019re the worst kisser she\\u2019s ever kissed.\\u201d And it was so devastating \\u2019cause not only was it probably true, but I couldn\\u2019t explain to my friends why it was true. I couldn\\u2019t say, \\u201cthat makes sense. I\\u2019ve never done that before.\\u201d So instead I had to play it off. I had to be like, \\u201cyeah, that sounds about right. \\u201cI\\u2019m a terrible kisser. That\\u2019s kind of my thing.\\u201d So I lean in to kiss Jenny, and she says, \\u201coh, no, thank you.\\u201d She agrees to go out with me in New York. We were both living in New York, and she gave me her number, and I typed it in my phone, and from that point on, she would be \\u201cJen, Irish pub, nice.\\u201d A few weeks later, I took her out to a restaurant I couldn\\u2019t afford to show her how much money I could put on my credit card. We\\u2019re out to dinner, and she says to me, she goes, \\u201ceveryone hates me at work,\\u201d and I said, \\u201cwhy would they hate you? I love you.\\u201d She goes, \\u201cyou love me?\\u201d I go, \\u201cI mean, you seem cool.\\u201d I pulled it back. I didn\\u2019t want to show all my cards. Just about nine of them. One of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said, \\u201cyou know, sometimes I\\u2019ll date two people at once, and that way I\\u2019m never let down by either person.\\u201d I said, \\u201cthat seems like a really smart plan. Like, I\\u2019d like to do that as well.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cI\\u2019m still kind of seeing my ex-boyfriend, John, and you can see other people too, but you have to tell me if you\\u2019re seeing them.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201call right, sounds like a plan. \\u201cGot it. Break! I got to go find some more people, you know.\\u201d And so a few nights later, I\\u2019m in another city, and I do a show, and after the show, I went out to a bar, and I ended up making out with this random girl. Then a few nights later, I\\u2019m out to dinner with Jenny, and she says, \\u201chow was your trip?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cit was great. I did some shows, \\u201cand then one night I ended up making out with this random girl.\\u201d And that didn\\u2019t go over very well in the conversation. I could sense that something was wrong. And I was like, \\u201cbut I\\u2019m right about that, right? Like, I\\u2019m supposed to tell you if that happens, right?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cyeah, but it doesn\\u2019t mean \\u201cthat I won\\u2019t lose interest in you.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cthat\\u2019s a whole new clause! \\u201cThat\\u2019s a twist! What is this, the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects?\\u201d I said, \\u201care you still seeing John?\\u201d And she said, \\u201csometimes.\\u201d I said, \\u201cwell, don\\u2019t you see the contradiction in that?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cyes.\\u201d And it gets very quiet\\u2026 Because we were falling in love. Three weeks into my relationship with Jenny, I built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to Bermuda. I wanted to show her how much more money I could put on my credit card. Since I didn\\u2019t have a lot left, we went to Bermuda \\u2019cause it was the off season. You can get these great deals online. Because as it turns out, when it\\u2019s winter in New York, it is also winter\\u2026 In Bermuda, and, uh\\u2026 Jenny and I meet up at the airport, and she\\u2019s late, which is a big pet peeve of mine. I fancy myself as a professional traveler. I\\u2019m always two hours early, I have my pocket for my ticket and my passport, and I have laceless moccasins. I never tell jokes about bombs. And\\u2026 and Jenny\\u2019s late. And then we get to security, and I\\u2019m not making this up, she doesn\\u2019t have a license or a passport. And I said, \\u201cwhat do you mean?\\u201d I go, \\u201chow do you travel?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cwell, \\u201cusually, they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work I.D.\\u201d I don\\u2019t like to dwell on the differences between men and women, but I just can\\u2019t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport, and they would let him on the plane. But women get a pass on things like this that I find completely bewildering. I mean, if I were in charge of Al-Qaeda, for example, what\\u2026 what I would do is I would recruit attractive women because they\\u2019re just not stopped under any circumstances. Although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the 72 virgins and, you know, the women wouldn\\u2019t want that, unless they\\u2019re lesbians, although there\\u2019s an idea, you know. Al-Qaeda\\u2026 Al-Qaeda could recruit hot lesbians, although\\u2026 then they\\u2019d have to guarantee that the 72 virgins are also lesbians. I mean, what are the odds, you know? All 72 virgins are also lesbians, unless you think of sexuality as, like, a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity. Like the 72 virgins are like, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t even know I was a lesbian \\u201cuntil I had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist. \\u201cAnd now that\\u2019s all I\\u2019m into. \\u201cI used to be into these Afghani guys who are so crazy, \\u201cthey\\u2019d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me \\u201cand 71 of my friends. But now I don\\u2019t see Khalid in the same way anymore.\\u201d The point is, we went to Bermuda, and we\\u2019re on the flight\\u2026 On the flight, and the flight attendant comes over, and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us. And she says, \\u201ccongratulations on your honeymoon.\\u201d And we said, \\u201coh, no, thanks. We\\u2019re not on our honeymoon.\\u201d And she walks away, and Jenny says, \\u201cthat\\u2019s so funny. I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ll ever go on a honeymoon.\\u201d And I said, \\u201coh, really?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cyeah. I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019d ever want to get married in my life.\\u201d And I said, \\u201coh, really?\\u201d I go, \\u201cme too.\\u201d I said, \\u201cis that based on a principle, \\u201cor did you have a bad relationship? Like, what was your first boyfriend like?\\u201d And\\u2026 She told me about her first boyfriend Brian. It was\\u2026 they were at the same bus stop when they were 16, and they would make out on the bus, and they were together for six years. And they\\u2026 you know, their relationship got deeper, and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together. And I said, \\u201cthen what?\\u201d And she said, \\u201che died. He had leukemia.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, do you ever talk about this with anyone?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cno, I don\\u2019t really like to talk about it.\\u201d But these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where Jenny was opening up to me, and I was opening up to her. And every night we\\u2019d be up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and we were so happy, we\\u2026 At one point, I was like, \\u201cwell, we should do this again. \\u201cWe should go on another trip. And you could get a license or a passport.\\u201d Jenny said, \\u201cthat sounds great, \\u201cbut I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019d get a license or a passport \\u2019cause they don\\u2019t make me get one.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cyeah, but it\\u2019s the law.\\u201d You know. Jenny says, \\u201cyeah, I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ll get one \\u201c\\u2019cause they don\\u2019t make me get one, you know. That\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d That\\u2019s how Jenny argues things. Sometimes she\\u2019ll just say, \\u201cthat\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d And I\\u2019ll say, \\u201cthat\\u2019s not an argument.\\u201d \\u201cLike, we\\u2019re not even in an argument right now because you don\\u2019t have an argument.\\u201d And she\\u2019ll say, \\u201cI just won that argument.\\u201d And I\\u2019ll say, \\u201cthat\\u2019s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is.\\u201d And she\\u2019ll say, \\u201cI just won that argument,\\u201d again. \\u201cThat\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d You could see how this could be a little bit maddening, you know, uh\\u2026 On our final day on the trip, we got into an argument about essentially nothing. She noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel, and she said, \\u201cwe should play.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cyeah, but not, like, a game.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cwhy?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, \\u2019cause I\\u2019d win.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cno, I think I would win.\\u201d I go, \\u201cno. I know that I\\u2019d win, \\u201cand I know that what I\\u2019m supposed to say is that\\u2026 \\u201cThe guy says, \\u2018I\\u2019ll win,\\u2019 the girl says, \\u2018I\\u2019ll win,\\u2019 \\u201cand the guy lets her win, and then she likes him more. But I just don\\u2019t have that in me.\\u201d And Jenny goes, \\u201cyou don\\u2019t have to let me win. Let\\u2019s go out and play.\\u201d And so we went out and played basketball, and I just kicked her ass. I mean, it was just like\\u2026 It was just like\\u2026 10 to 1, you know, 11 to 1. I mean, I was having a good day, but still, I was just destroying her. And at one point, she literally said, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never met someone who\\u2019s so obsessed with the score.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cthe score is what makes it a game!\\u201d So we\\u2019re arguing this over lunch, and then, again, it comes up at dinner, and then we\\u2019re still arguing about it at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning about essentially nothing. And she said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t understand why you\\u2019re so obsessed with being right.\\u201d I go, \\u201cI\\u2019m not obsessed with it. I just am.\\u201d I said, \\u201cwhy do you think you\\u2019re right?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cthat\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d I said, \\u201cif you think I\\u2019m so wrong about everything, why are you even with me?\\u201d And Jenny says, \\u201cyou can\\u2019t choose who you love.\\u201d Which is true, but it doesn\\u2019t mean it\\u2019s good. I remember the first time I fell in love, I was in high school, and it was that first time where you fall in love, and you\\u2019re just like, \\u201cthis is it. I found her. I\\u2019m 17 years old, and I\\u2019m done, you know.\\u201d And\\u2026 Her name was Amanda, and she was, like, adorable and funny. And what was really exciting for me was that she was, like, a delinquent. Like, I was like this play-by-the-rules school citizen, and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid, which I thought was a really strong quality. Like, at one point, she was like, \\u201cit was totally messed up because it wasn\\u2019t even me. It was this other girl, and I was framed.\\u201d And I was just like, \\u201cawesome.\\u201d Like no one would ever frame me for anything. I just\\u2026 I thought it was like an opposites attract situation. She wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper. And I wanted to know what it was like to be cool. At one point, I was like, \\u201cdo you want to write an article for the newspaper?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to write an article. I want to do things people write articles about.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cgood answer.\\u201d\\nI find that when you fall in love, you tend to overlook certain red flags. One of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me, but then she would pull it back. She\\u2019d be like, \\u201cno one likes you at all. Only kidding.\\u201d Or, like, \\u201cyou\\u2019re like a nerd, but you\\u2019re not even smart. Just joking.\\u201d Can\\u2019t choose who you love.\\nSecond red flag with Amanda was that she was a liar. And I don\\u2019t\\u2026 I don\\u2019t mean that in an offensive way. Like, lying was kind of like a\\u2026 It\\u2019s like a sport at the school I was at. I transferred from the all boys school to this co-ed school. There was this one guy in my class named Keith Robbins who was a legendary liar. You\\u2019d know when he was lying \\u2019cause he would lick his finger like a bookie, and he would dart his eyes from side to side. And he\\u2019d go, \\u201cyeah, yeah, nice. Nice, you know.\\u201d And he wasn\\u2019t even handling money. Like, I don\\u2019t even know what this is about. And then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant. He\\u2019d be like, \\u201cyeah, my uncle\\u2019s Tony Robbins, \\u201cmotivational speaker. Yeah, nice, you know.\\u201d And\\u2026 We found out that that wasn\\u2019t even true. But even if that were true, that wouldn\\u2019t be impressive to a bunch of high school students. But I think that\\u2019s the jedi level of lying, is you lie about little stuff, and no one notices when you\\u2019re lying about big stuff. It\\u2019s like banking.\\nThe final red flag with Amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend. I know. I\\u2019m in the future also. I think we can all see now \\u2019cause we\\u2019re so smart, and Mike\\u2019s so dumb, and, uh\\u2026 You know, I can also see, in retrospect, that\\u2019s a much bigger red flag than I perceived it to be at the time, but I was so excited she was even with me at all. And she said she had another boyfriend at home, but they were in the process of breaking up, but it was a bad time \\u2019cause his parents were sick. And so I tried to be understanding of that. You know, I went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents. And I thought, \\u201cwell, this is the affirmation that I need. I\\u2019m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend.\\u201d And I drive my mom\\u2019s station wagon to Amanda\\u2019s parents\\u2019 house, and I walk in the front door, and there\\u2019s Amanda, and there\\u2019s her parents, and it\\u2019s going well. And a few hours go by, and this other guy comes over to the house, and his name is Scott. I\\u2019m assuming he\\u2019s, like, a family friend or a relative. And slowly I\\u2019m noticing similarities between Scott and things that Amanda has said about her other boyfriend. They\\u2019re both in their first year in college, and they\\u2019re competitive wrestlers, and\\u2026 It\\u2019s dawning on me that I\\u2019m hanging out with my girlfriend\\u2019s boyfriend. And it\\u2019s going pretty well. I mean, he\\u2026 He seemed like a nice guy. I could totally see what she saw in him. There was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom, she would hold on to my hand, and she would say, \\u201cI wish it were just you and me here.\\u201d And I remember thinking, \\u201cyou could make that happen.\\u201d The way she said it was as though she weren\\u2019t involved in the decision process, like, \\u201cI\\u2019d love to, but the boys in corporate\\u2026\\u201d\\nWell, the day took an even stranger turn when Scott suggested that we go hang out at his house. And I met his parents. It is indescribable meeting your girlfriend\\u2019s boyfriend\\u2019s parents for the first time. Part of you is angry for obvious reasons, but then part of you still wants to make a good impression. You know, you\\u2019re like\\u2026 \\u201cMaybe if this goes well, she\\u2019ll see that I\\u2019m good with adults in general!\\u201d As a side note, his parents seemed in perfect health. At one point, his dad even said to me, \\u201chow do you know Amanda?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwe\\u2019re just friends from school.\\u201d And I was so ashamed, and I felt so dumb. And I drove home, and I remember thinking, \\u201cI am never gonna let this happen to me again.\\u201d So\\u2026 Ten months into my relationship with Jenny, she invites me to meet her parents. And this was a tricky time. At this point, our relationship was intense, but casual, which is a dangerous relationship cocktail, and it was a hard thing to organize \\u2019cause I was away probably five days out of the week. And so we found a Sunday where I was coming back from a five-day stint in Texas, which was awful \\u2019cause it was\\u2026 In Texas. And I\\u2026 that\\u2019s\\u2026 That\\u2019s not to say I dislike Texas entirely. It\\u2019s such a large thing to dislike. And, uh\\u2026 But that week it felt like Texas just disliked me, and I just kind of disliked Texas back to the point where I developed a small drinking problem, which is\\u2026 which is very popular in Texas. I was performing at a comedy club. Now, comedy\\u2026 I love comedy clubs \\u2019cause they\\u2019re sort of a high-low entertainment proposition. Like, in some ways, though, they\\u2019re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word, and then some of them sell dildo straws, you know. Like, there\\u2019s 15 bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends, and they\\u2019re handing out gummy penises or whatever. That\\u2019s\\u2026 that\\u2019s actually a thing. I didn\\u2019t even realize that\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was\\u2026 was the gummy quality of the penis. I feel like if I were in charge of the candification of the penis, it would be hard candy. And then if\\u2026 And then, if you suck it down to the gummy part, then you just sort of put that off to the side. But I\\u2026 but that\\u2019s\\u2026 that\\u2019s not my job. I\\u2019m\\u2026 you know, I leave that to the experts, but I just\\u2026 I just do the comedy part. But I was performing at this club all week, and after the late show Saturday night, I was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things. And\\u2026 I\\u2019d been drinking all week, and, uh, I always try to be a team player, you know. So I was like, \\u201cwhatever I can do to help. I don\\u2019t see how this could end badly.\\u201d And, uh\\u2026 The next morning, I wake up in the my hotel room, and I\\u2019m hung over, and I\\u2019m groggy. And I roll out of bed, and I run to the airport to catch my flight. I\\u2019m still two hours early, and\\u2026 I land in New York, and I get a cab to Jenny\\u2019s parents\\u2019 house. And I walk in the front door, and there\\u2019s Jenny, and there\\u2019s her parents. And there\\u2019s her other sort of ex-boyfriend, John. And he wasn\\u2019t front and center. Like, he was just kind of around, like, he was in the pool, like, wading and doing laps, like, that kind of thing. But I pulled Jenny aside, I was like, \\u201cwell, what\\u2019s John doing here?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cwell, he and I aren\\u2019t still together, \\u201cbut when we were together, \\u201che became friends with my stepdad, \\u201cand he\\u2019s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cyou know, that\\u2019s not good. I feel like that gives him the edge.\\u201d Jenny\\u2019s staring at me. And I said, \\u201cwhat?\\u201d She says, \\u201cyou have a hickey on your neck.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s true.\\u201d And then I glance at the mirror next to me and realize that, in fact, I do have a hickey on my neck. And I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry.\\u201d And she says, \\u201cwhere is that from?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cthere was this bachelorette party, and I was drunk.\\u201d That sentence never comes out right. I mean, there\\u2019s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay, and\\u2026 We start arguing, and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment. I didn\\u2019t have a leg to stand on. I was like, \\u201cwell, what about John? What was he doing there?\\u201d She said, \\u201cyou have a hickey on your neck.\\u201d I said, \\u201cyeah, but at least I told you the truth.\\u201d And she said, \\u201ceventually.\\u201d And I said, \\u201ceventually is better than never!\\u201d And then she kneed me in the balls. I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever experienced this before. I\\u2019m sure half of you have not. Uh\\u2026 It\\u2019s like being electrocuted, except you don\\u2019t get to die. It\\u2019s like you want to die, but you can\\u2019t. And there\\u2019s a person in your face saying, \\u201cyou deserve this,\\u201d which they wouldn\\u2019t even do in electrocutions. I think they would deem that as inhumane.\\u00a0 Even in Texas.\\nJenny says, \\u201cI think that we should just break up. \\u201cYou know, it\\u2019s not just this. \\u201cI mean, you\\u2019re away a lot of the time. \\u201cAnd even when you\\u2019re here, you work at night, \\u201cand I work in the day. I just don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s gonna work out.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cokay.\\u201d\\u00a0 And we were apart for about six months, and I missed her so much, but I kept resisting calling her \\u2019cause I wanted to give her space. And every once in a while I\\u2019d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from \\u201cJen, Irish pub, nice.\\u201d And it would just say, \\u201chi.\\u201d And I\\u2019d write back, \\u201chi.\\u201d It was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another, but I think, in some ways, kept us together. And finally, on new year\\u2019s, I caved in, and I called her, I said, \\u201chey, I really miss you, and I want to see you.\\u201d And we got together for coffee. And we hit it off just like we used to, and we decided we would get back together. We had a great period there, you know. I took her to get a license and a passport. First, we went for her social security card, and then we took that to the D.M.V. And then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport. It was like the triple crown of identifications. Jenny was wildly identifiable. One night, she was heading back from my apartment to hers, and she stops. And I said, \\u201cwhat?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cI think that we should live together.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno, I really don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s a good idea. \\u201cYou know, I\\u2019ve just decided, you know, as a principle, \\u201cI\\u2019m not gonna get married or live with someone. It\\u2019s not personal.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cwell, unless we live together, \\u201cI just don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s gonna work out \\u201c\\u2019cause we just don\\u2019t see each other enough, \\u201cand I don\\u2019t think that we stand a chance. That\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d So we moved in together. And one day, Jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends, and she invites me to come along. And I said, \\u201coh, no, thanks.\\u201d That doesn\\u2019t go over so well. She says, \\u201cwhy?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, as you know, \\u201cI don\\u2019t believe in marriage, and so I don\\u2019t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it.\\u201d She said, \\u201cwell, what do you believe in?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\u201d She said, \\u201cwell, if you don\\u2019t believe in anything, how can you not believe in marriage?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, first of all, \\u201cyou know, it just doesn\\u2019t seem necessary. \\u201cI mean, is it\\u2026 you know, \\u201cmarriage is an archaic institution \\u201cinvented in the middle ages based on exchanging property. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to be a part of that. \\u201cSecond of all, I don\\u2019t even think we have \\u201ca common cultural understanding of what marriage even is. \\u201cI mean, one of me and Andy\\u2019s friends \\u201cwas about to get engaged, and we were skeptical, \\u201cand we said, \\u2018are you sure this is the person \\u201cyou want to be with for the rest of your life?\\u2019 \\u201cand he goes, \\u2018yeah, I think so.\\u2019 \\u201cand we said, \\u2018well, what if she gets in a car accident, \\u201cand she\\u2019s disfigured? Would you stay with her then?\\u2019 \\u201cand he said, \\u2018maybe\\u2019! \\u201cThat is not an acceptable answer! \\u201cThird of all, if I\\u2019m so in love, \\u201cwhy does it need to be written into a government contract? \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m not one of these like, \\u201c\\u2018I don\\u2019t want government up in my business\\u2019 kind of people! \\u201cI think the government does a nice job \\u201cdelivering the mail and suggesting I don\\u2019t eat poison, \\u201cbut I just don\\u2019t understand why they need to be involved \\u201cin my personal relationships. \\u201cThen finally, if marriage is religious, \\u201cshouldn\\u2019t I believe in the religion? \\u201cI\\u2019ve been to more weddings of my friends \\u201cwhere the people on the altar don\\u2019t believe \\u201cin the religion of the church they\\u2019ve invited us to! \\u201cSome of them even go to classes with the priest \\u201cin advance, to more elaborately lie \\u201cabout believing in a religion they don\\u2019t believe in \\u201cjust to have a wedding in a fancy building! \\u201cThat is insane! That\\u2019s how I feel!\\u201d So I explain this to Jenny. And Jenny says, \\u201cwell, if you ever did want to get married, I would marry you.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwhy? Aren\\u2019t you listening to any of this?\\u201d And Jenny says, \\u201cthat\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d At this point, it was 5:00 in the morning, we\\u2019d been arguing all night, and we hadn\\u2019t slept. I had to catch a flight at 6:20 A.M. Out of Newark airport to Los Angeles for a show I was doing that night. At this point, I\\u2019m overtired, and I\\u2019m angry, and I\\u2019m late. I\\u2019m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase. And I walk out of our apartment. It\\u2019s 5:00 A.M., that part of the morning before the earth even exists, before they program The Matrix or whatever. You walk out of your apartment, part of the road isn\\u2019t even there. There\\u2019s a guy with a laptop going, \\u201cwe need a road, stat! What\\u2019s the code for building, tank?\\u201d You know, and I get to the airport. The news hasn\\u2019t even started yet. It\\u2019s just an anchor looking around like, \\u201cwhat are you up to?\\u201d And I get to the kiosk, and I print up my ticket, and I bring it to the security lady, and she looks at me, and she goes, \\u201cwell, that ain\\u2019t your gate.\\u201d Like, I guess they changed the gate, but the way she said it was as though I had participated in the decision of changing it. I was like, \\u201cI was not involved in this process. I wasn\\u2019t even C.C.\\u2019d.\\u201d Like, as though I had gone to the kiosk and been like, \\u201cB22. Like hell I\\u2019m flying out of B22.\\u201d And then I photoshopped my own ticket, printed it out, and been like, \\u201cthis is where I\\u2019m going.\\u201d You know, I\\u2019m not that aggressive as a traveler, so I was like, \\u201cwell, where is this gate?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cit\\u2019s in another terminal. You got to take a tram.\\u201d She points to the tram, and I start walking my roller suitcase, and I hear her say, \\u201cand you better run.\\u201d Like, I guess I was late at that point. So I started running. And the roller suitcase does not enjoy running. The roller suitcase was like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to run. I have wheels.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to run either, but this is what we have to do. \\u201cI tell you what, when we get to the hotel, I\\u2019ll walk you in circles for a few hours.\\u201d Then I\\u2026 I get to the tram, and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives. And it says zero minutes. I was like, \\u201cperfect. That\\u2019s exactly how long I want to wait.\\u201d But the tram\\u2019s riding away. I was like, \\u201cthat\\u2019s -1 minute!\\u201d Then it says ten minutes, and I\\u2019m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like, \\u201coh, great, I\\u2019m gonna miss my flight, \\u201cand then I\\u2019m gonna miss every flight from now on, \\u201cand I\\u2019m gonna miss my family reunion. \\u201cAnd then I\\u2019m not gonna have a family, and then I\\u2019m gonna be a crack whore.\\u201d And it\\u2019s like, all of a sudden, I\\u2019m a crack whore just because I miss this one flight. I can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and\\u2026\\nI get on the next tram ten minutes later, and I run to the gate, and I\\u2019m sweaty, and I\\u2019m out of breath, but I\\u2019m on time. And I\\u2019m so relieved that I sit down in a chair at the gate, and I fall asleep. And I wake up to the sound of the door shutting. I jump up, and the door is closed, and I am on the sad side of the door. The happy side has an airplane and a pilot. The sad side is me and the Cinnabon lady. Normally, I\\u2019d be very excited if it were just me and the Cinnabon lady. I\\u2019m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year. I think that\\u2019s an effective use of time. But in this instance, I needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane. And the Cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community. I was like, \\u201cdo you know these people?\\u201d She was like, \\u201call I know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun.\\u201d I ran up to the giant glass window. I started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy. I was like, \\u201cDrew Barrymore\\u2019s character, come back!\\u201d She didn\\u2019t come back, and I missed my flight. I got on the next one they could get me on. There was a stopover in Texas. You know how I feel about Texas. And, uh, I get to Los Angeles late that night, and I\\u2019d missed my show. I\\u2019d never missed one of my shows before, and I\\u2019m so angry. And Jenny\\u2019s calling me, but I\\u2019m not picking up the phone \\u2019cause I\\u2019m blaming this entire day on her. I get back to my friend Andy\\u2019s house, and I said, \\u201cAndy, this relationship is messing up my entire life!\\u201d And Andy goes, \\u201cyou\\u2019re right.\\u201d I go, \\u201cI know! I\\u2019m right!\\u201d He goes, \\u201cyeah, you\\u2019re right.\\u201d I go, \\u201cI know, I\\u2019m right! I got to tell her about this in the morning!\\u201d I drive out of Andy\\u2019s small road, and I\\u2019m t-boned. That\\u2019s the culinary way of describing it. In 1 1/2 seconds, I\\u2019m spun around, and I think I\\u2019m dead. No, wait, I\\u2019m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. Then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. 20 minutes later I\\u2019m sitting on a curb. At this point, the police have arri\\u2026 have arrived, as well as my friend, Andy, and that\\u2019s when I start crying. You know how when you drop a baby on the ground, it doesn\\u2019t\\u2026 Doesn\\u2019t start crying right away because it doesn\\u2019t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face? And then it\\u2019s like, \\u201coh, I guess I should be doing something \\u201cthat matches that. Waah!\\u201d I\\u2019m crying because I\\u2019m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that, in that moment, I might have ceased to exist. Like I said earlier, I don\\u2019t really believe in anything, so in my mind, that would have been the end of all things I\\u2019d experienced in my life. Every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion, and\\u2026 The officer comes over, and he says, \\u201cwhat happened?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI got hit by this car, \\u201cand then I heard nothing, and then I heard the other car skid out and drive away.\\u201d The officer points over to the light. The other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree. I can\\u2019t help but think, \\u201cthat\\u2019s karma. That\\u2019s a hit and run and hit.\\u201d And then the officer puts this form in my face, and he goes, \\u201csign this.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, what does it mean?\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cit means you\\u2019re okay and that we can leave.\\u201d I was really shaken up. I was like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m okay.\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cjust sign it,\\u201d which is a very unattractive quality. When someone just repeats a command that you\\u2019ve just said no to, and it\\u2019s unattractive, but very effective, you know. I signed it. Andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution, but we have to wait two hours \\u2019cause the other driver had beat us there, and\\u2026 Eventually, we\\u2019re with the doctor, and Andy says to him, he goes, \\u201cwell, was the other guy drunk?\\u201d And the doctor says, \\u201cwell, I can\\u2019t answer that.\\u201d And Andy says, \\u201cwas he?\\u201d He uses the technique we had learned earlier, and it works, you know. The doctor says, \\u201cwell, he\\u2019s heading to jail now.\\u201d And Andy and I flash each other a look like the hardy boys, like, \\u201ccase closed.\\u201d A few hours later, we\\u2019re back at Andy\\u2019s house, it\\u2019s probably around 3:30 in the morning, and I have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have near-death experiences. I say, \\u201cI need to call Jenny and tell her that we need to get married.\\u201d And Andy says, \\u201cMike\\u2026 Sleep on it.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno, no, no, this makes perfect sense.\\u201d And I pick up my phone, and I dial her number. And he puts his hand over the phone, and he says, \\u201cMike\\u2026 Sleep on it.\\u201d He saves me. The next morning, I fly back to New York, and a few weeks later, I get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that I just described. And it had found me at fault and that I owed\\u2026 And I\\u2019m not making this up\\u2026 $12,000 for the repairs on the other driver\\u2019s Mercedes S.U.V. And I was like, \\u201cwell, this can\\u2019t be happening.\\u201d I explained to the woman, \\u201cI think it\\u2019s a misunderstanding. \\u201cThe other guy was clearly drunk. It was definitely not my fault.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry, but unless they change the accident report, you owe this money.\\u201d So I requested the accident report, and I\\u2019m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight. I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever seen one of these things before\\u2026 But it\\u2019s a little bit like homework for cops. And officer timson not so good with the homework. He consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two, vehicle one and vehicle two. At one point, so badly that he says P-1\\u2026 that\\u2019s me\\u2026 started to go, but all of a sudden V-1\\u2026 That\\u2019s me also\\u2026 Came at a high rate of speed, crashing into him. Now, I\\u2019m pretty self-destructive as a person, but I would never crash into my own car with my own car, nor would I understand how you could do that. This part is even crazier. The other driver\\u2019s statement at the scene of the accident was, \\u201cI was on Venice going\\u2026 uh, I\\u2019m not too sure. \\u201cI was going away from the beach. \\u201cI was driving. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what happened. \\u201cDid I hurt anyone? \\u201cI don\\u2019t know where I was going, \\u201cbut I came from home. I had a sip of beer.\\u201d Which is really everyone\\u2019s favorite quantity of beer. Just the one sip, right? That\\u2019s what they serve these days at the home/beach/pub.\\nSo all of it\\u2019s mine. The officer makes one key mistake. He checks the box that finds me at fault. So I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI need to get officer Timson on the phone, so we can clear up this misunderstanding.\\u201d The problem is he keeps ducking my calls, and I know \\u2019cause I\\u2019m calling two or three times a day, leaving messages, calling departments next to his department, so he knows I\\u2019m trying to reach him. And finally, after a month of this, I get him on the phone, and I\\u2019m so relieved. And I explain this misunderstanding. And he listens to me, and he says, \\u201cdo the right thing, and pay for the guy\\u2019s car.\\u201d I know, and, I mean, that\\u2019s what I said. I go, \\u201caren\\u2019t you listening to any of this?\\u201d I go, \\u201cand this guy was clearly drunk. \\u201cI mean, he nearly killed me. \\u201cInches from where he hit, \\u201cand I would be dead right now. \\u201cAnd he wants me to pay for his car? \\u201cDon\\u2019t you see how crazy that is, just as one human being to another?\\u201d And he says, \\u201cdo the right thing, and pay for the guy\\u2019s car.\\u201d And he hangs up the phone. And at this point, this stops being about money, and it\\u2019s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law. This is Chinatown! So I started printing up Google maps of the scene of the accident and California state driving law. I\\u2019m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators. There\\u2019s only one lawyer who would consider the case. And he was an accident lawyer, and he said, \\u201cdid you have any loss of income from the accident?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno,\\u201d and he says, \\u201cdid you have any loss of income from the accident?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno. This isn\\u2019t about money.\\u201d And he doesn\\u2019t take the case, and this is when I start going completely mad.\\nI\\u2019m up to about 4:00 or 5:00 A.M. every night just surfing the web. I get a subscription to a site called netdetective.com, which is a great site for vigilantes who have $29.95. So now I know this guy\\u2019s name, I know where he lives, I know what he does for a living. And in my mind, it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller. Like, \\u201cJim Bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this, \\u201cbut Jim Bosworth had another thing coming: Mike Birbiglia.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna track down Jim Bosworth. \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna sue Jim Bosworth, and I\\u2019m gonna sue the entire Los Angeles police department!\\u201d At this point, people stopped talking to me entirely. My friends would call me like, \\u201chey, what\\u2019s going on?\\u201d I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cI\\u2019ll tell you what\\u2019s going on!\\u201d I\\u2019d tell them this whole story. And they\\u2019d be like, \\u201cyou should get a lawyer.\\u201d I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cthis is way past lawyers! A lawyer wouldn\\u2019t even touch this!\\u201d \\u2018Cause he wouldn\\u2019t.\\nThe only person who would talk to me at this point was Jenny. One night, we were out to dinner at a restaurant, and she\\u2019s talking to me, but I\\u2019m not listening \\u2019cause I\\u2019m writing down ideas I have for the case on my napkin. I\\u2019ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection, and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in, the laws the other driver broke, and the phone numbers I\\u2019m gonna call that week. And I\\u2019m so angry, I\\u2019m writing over my own handwriting to the point where I\\u2019m ripping through the napkin. And Jenny looks at me, and she says, \\u201cwhat are you doing?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, this is my case.\\u201d And she says, \\u201cwell, why don\\u2019t you work on that in the morning?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, which part of this napkin don\\u2019t you understand?\\u201d Jenny says, \\u201cMike\\u2026 \\u201cYou\\u2019re right, \\u201cbut it\\u2019s only hurting you, \\u201cand I\\u2019m just so glad that you\\u2019re alive, and I think that we should focus on that.\\u201d She only has to say it once, and I give up the case, and I pay for this guy\\u2019s car. July 7, 2007, Jenny and I went to city hall and got married. I still didn\\u2019t believe in the idea of marriage, and I still don\\u2019t. But I believe in her, and I\\u2019ve given up on the idea of being right. Thank you guys very much. Thank you. Thank you guys so much!

[Upbeat music playing] Hello! Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down. [Chuckles] Thank you, Boston. I appreciate that. [Whooping] Uh, that\\u2019s very sweet of you. [Man] Love you! I\\u2019m at the end of the tour right now. I\\u2019m very happy to be on tour because I now have a child. Ah, so\\u2026 any time out of home is good for me. Um, I got my girlfriend pregnant after knowing her for two months. So\\u2026 [Audience cheering] Thank you. Thank you. Life decisions. And she\\u2019s a nice girl, and I love her in a way, sure. My problem with my girlfriend is, she\\u2019s very sweet, but she\\u2019s shit at telling stories, and I\\u2019m awesome at telling stories, so it really bothers me when she talks. And I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019ll be a problem in the future, but it\\u2019s a problem now and I don\\u2019t see it getting better. Um\\u2026 I\\u2019ll give you an example, right? I was in the car, and my son Hank was asleep in the back seat, and we\\u2019re driving along, and on the radio comes Madonna, and my girlfriend just slips into conversation, \\u201cOh, I used to party with Madonna.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cYou fucking what, when?\\u201d And she went, \\u201cI used to party with Madonna.\\u201d Now, I should fill you in a little bit on this. My girlfriend used to be a model in Miami, right? I\\u2019m not bragging. I didn\\u2019t get the model years. I didn\\u2019t get those years. I\\u2019ve seen the photos. Very impressive. Um\\u2026 So, I said, \\u201cSo you used to party with Madonna. Madonna used to have big parties and invite models over, right?\\u201d And she went, \\u201cNo, no, it would just be me and a few other people.\\u201d I go, \\u201cYou need to elaborate on this story right now.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cOh, okay, I used to date the center for the Miami Heat.\\u201d As soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an NBA center, even if this guy\\u2019s even slightly in proportion\\u2026 a lot of things flood through your head. First thing is, \\u201cThat\\u2019s why your cunt\\u2019s so fucked up.\\u201d That\\u2019s a big one. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why our child came out while you were walking. I understand.\\u201d So she said, \\u201cI used to date the center for the Miami Heat. His best friend was Dennis Rodman. Dennis Rodman used to go out with Madonna, and we used to go over to Madonna\\u2019s house.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cThis one time, the four of us were over at Madonna\\u2019s house, and we were all fucked up on drugs, and one thing led to another\\u2026\\u201d And then I went, \\u201cShut the fuck up!\\u201d And she went, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I said, \\u201cI know what \\u2018one thing led to another\\u2019 means! You all started fucking each other!\\u201d And she went, \\u201cWe did. We started\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cJust shut up!\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cWhat do you care for?\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re the mother of my child! I don\\u2019t wanna picture you being fucked by a 7\\u20192\\u2033 NBA player while you\\u2019re licking out Madonna\\u2019s muscular vagina and Dennis Rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock, going\\u2026\\u201d [Moaning] And she goes, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re being silly. What do you care for? You\\u2019ve partied way more than I have in my life.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cThat is not true. I\\u2019ve gotten wasted way more than you have, but I have, in no way, partied way more than you have. Often, I get wasted just by myself. I wouldn\\u2019t call it a party.\\u201d For most of my career, I was a struggling comedian, right? And this is how struggling comedians party, right? It\\u2019s 5:00 a.m., Monday, right? We\\u2019re in a one-bedroom apartment. Seven of us are standing around a coffee table, trying to stretch out two grams of coke. One of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories\\u2026 and the rest of us are talking about where women might be. One of us has come up with a plan. The plan goes like this, \\u201cWell\\u2026 nurses will be finishing their shift soon. Maybe if we just stand out the front of the ER, they\\u2019ll appreciate seven funny guys.\\u201d [Chuckles] I don\\u2019t\\u2026 You know, I\\u2019ve never partied like a model. I have partied twice in my life. Twice. Like, really partied. I\\u2019ve had good nights out, but I\\u2019ve really partied twice. If you really party, and most people never experience this, it\\u2019s an amazing thing. It happens in Vegas. It can only happen in Vegas, and it\\u2019s gotta involve celebrity, right? I\\u2019m not famous, but the people around me were super famous, and I was at this party in the night club, and they took me in. And then there\\u2019s the night club, but then there\\u2019s the real night club out the back, which is, like, the size of this stage. It\\u2019s only a little room. And you go back there and you can just\\u2026 They encourage you to take drugs in the open, and you\\u2019re just doing it off a key, [Sniffs] and they\\u2019re going, \\u201cNo, dude. Use the table. Don\\u2019t use your\\u2026\\u201d And I go, \\u201cOh, oh. Oh, sorry. Um\\u2026\\u201d And it\\u2019s confusing at first, and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room. Just bring \\u2019em in like, \\u201cHuh?\\u201d And you can do this. You can go\\u2026 \\u201cUh\\u2026\\u201d Like that. And they\\u2019ll drag these women away. It is the best thing you\\u2019ll ever do with your life. When you party that hard as a man, there\\u2019s a lot of remorse \\u2019cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money. You wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover, and you go to your friends. You go, \\u201cOh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I spent $5,000.\\u201d When a hot girl parties that hard, she wakes up in the morning and goes, \\u201cOh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I made $5,000.\\u201d And that\\u2019s a vastly different emotion that\\u2026 I don\\u2019t think women will never\\u2026 Yeah, okay. This is the thing. In America, at the moment, they\\u2019re trying to raise the minimum wage to, I don\\u2019t know, $16 an hour or something like that, and whenever they bring up this argument, they always go, \\u201cAnd still to this day, women only earn 70% of what men earn in the workplace.\\u201d And of course, that\\u2019s disgusting. How dare women earn so much? Like\\u2026 a lot of things that I say tonight will be jokes that I don\\u2019t actually mean, but this is something I\\u2019m really passionate about. Women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace. I\\u2019m sorry. I\\u2026 [Audience whooping] I\\u2019m not being a misogynistic bastard, right? I\\u2019m not saying that women don\\u2019t work as hard. I\\u2019m sure they do. I\\u2019m not saying they don\\u2019t do as good a job. What I\\u2019m saying is they don\\u2019t deserve to earn as much money as men. Right? Men need that extra 30% to buy meals and drinks and Jim Jefferies tickets and all that shit! [Audience cheering] Now\\u2026 I\\u2019m sure there\\u2019s women in this room that are saying, \\u201cOh, I pay for my drinks. I bought my own ticket.\\u201d And don\\u2019t think we don\\u2019t appreciate the uglies, \\u2019cause we do. Right? We do. But there\\u2019s little things in society that you can\\u2019t change. Men have extra expenses that you\\u2019ll never understand. There\\u2019s holidays that are just for women. Like Valentine\\u2019s Day is just for women. They say it\\u2019s for romantics. They say it\\u2019s for couples or something like that. It\\u2019s just for women. There\\u2019s no man who gets excited by Valentine\\u2019s Day. There\\u2019s no man that when he sees the Valentine\\u2019s Day decorations go up in the shopping mall, he goes, \\u201cOh, Valentine\\u2019s Day is coming!\\u201d Valentine\\u2019s Day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head, and it goes like this, \\u201cHow much money do I have to spend today so that you won\\u2019t act like a cunt?\\u201d It doesn\\u2019t stop there. Mother\\u2019s Day! Mother\\u2019s Day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old. My girlfriend\\u2019s first Mother\\u2019s Day. And she went, \\u201cOh, I wonder what I\\u2019ll get for Mother\\u2019s Day.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cProbably fucking nothing. He\\u2019s got no money. He\\u2019s six months old. What do you think he\\u2019s gonna buy you?\\u201d Within an hour, her friends were over at the house, just by coincidence, telling me what a bad person I was and how important Mother\\u2019s Day is to a new mum, you know? And so, I went and bought her a cappuccino machine \\u2019cause I assumed that\\u2019s what Hank would have wanted her to have\\u2026 and I wrote a card. I\\u2019m not a bastard. I wrote a card. I\\u2019m right-handed. So I got my left hand. Every new dad knows this. You get the crayon and you go, [Imitating child] \\u201cHappy Mother\\u2019s Day. Love, Hank.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cH-A-N\\u2026\\u201d And then I did the \\u201cK\\u201d back-to-front because he\\u2019s a fucking moron. See, now I know there\\u2019s people in the room, they\\u2019re thinking, \\u201cWell, fathers have Father\\u2019s Day.\\u201d Father\\u2019s Day is bullshit. It\\u2019s fucking shit, Father\\u2019s Day. Father\\u2019s Day came around and my girlfriend went, \\u201cWhat do you want for Father\\u2019s Day?\\u201d And I went, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want anything. Don\\u2019t even worry about it. I don\\u2019t want anything.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cCome on. You gotta have something.\\u201d I said, \\u201cHonestly, I don\\u2019t want anything.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cCome on.\\u201d And I went, \\u201cIt\\u2019s my fucking money. Just don\\u2019t touch it. Just leave my money alone. How hard is this? How about, for 24 hours, you don\\u2019t touch my fucking money? That would be a gift.\\u201d That\\u2019s why every single father has that one Father\\u2019s Day gift that they cherish, and it\\u2019s shit! It\\u2019s, like, a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handle\\u2019s too big, and it says, \\u201cI heart Dad.\\u201d And they keep that for 20 fucking years, this mug. And do you wanna know why they like it? Every now and again, they look at it and go\\u2026 \\u201cThat cost me nothing, that mug.\\u201d [Audience whooping] See\\u2026 wouldn\\u2019t it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff, but didn\\u2019t cost anything, that everyone could participate in, right? I\\u2019ve got it, right? April 18th\\u2026 Anal Sex Day. [Men cheering loudly] It\\u2019s good, isn\\u2019t it? Everyone\\u2019s girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on April 18th. It\\u2019s nice. A month before, you\\u2019d be walking around the shopping center going, \\u201cOh, the decorations are up!\\u201d [Men whooping] And it\\u2019s good \\u2019cause if your bird didn\\u2019t take it in the ass, you could do the same thing that women do on Valentine\\u2019s Day when they don\\u2019t get a gift. You could go like, \\u201cOh, me mate, Jason, his wife took it in the ass twice. Yeah, obviously, they\\u2019re more connected than we are. They\\u2019ve, uh\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, I don\\u2019t do much merchandise after my shows and stuff, but I\\u2019m thinking of bringing out some April 18th T-shirts. Not even putting \\u201cJim Jefferies\\u201d on them or anything. Just T-shirts that say, \\u201cApril 18th.\\u201d \\u2018Cause it\\u2019s good, right? You\\u2019re in a bar. You\\u2019re a guy. You see a guy at the other end of the bar with an April 18th, and you go\\u2026 Fucking friends for life, right? But even better, you see a girl with an April 18th T-shirt. The weird thing is I\\u2019m bigging-up anal sex here, and I don\\u2019t even really like fucking girls in the ass that much. I\\u2019m not even a huge fan. I much prefer the cunt. I think it\\u2019s a much more\\u2026 I think that a cunt is a much more purpose-built thing to fuck. But, you know, anal sex\\u2026 Oh, you know\\u2026 I do it. I get involved, \\u2019cause I feel like I have to. You know, I\\u2026 But I\\u2019ve never been a big fan of the ass fucking, I, uh\\u2026 When I watch it on porn, it seems very inviting. The girl\\u2019s taking it so fluently in her ass, and she seems to be having fun, and, uh\\u2026 But the thing is, you can\\u2019t smell porn. You don\\u2019t smell porn. You just\\u2026 You just watch it. They never\\u2026 And it\\u2019s different, porn. It\\u2019s different. They clean the girl\\u2019s asshole. They pump water into it until it\\u2019s very hygienic. I\\u2019m sure. And the girl seems to be so happy. She\\u2019s like\\u2026 You\\u2019ve got it in her pussy, you\\u2019re fucking her, and then she\\u2019s like, \\u201cPut it in my ass.\\u201d She\\u2019s inviting. It\\u2019s like you\\u2019re doing her a favor in porn. And then she\\u2019s like\\u2026 She says things\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know, things like, \\u201cI\\u2019m enjoying that. Keep putting it in my ass. Fuck my ass. I love a cock in my ass.\\u201d And\\u2026 And the experience I\\u2019ve had in my own life has been vastly different. I\\u2019ve\\u2026 My experience has been a lot of crying. Now, although that can help you come at times, it\\u2019s not what you want\\u2026 It\\u2019s not what you want for every day. I like the girl who acts like she\\u2019s enjoying it. Like, you know when your girlfriend\\u2019s like, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna act like I enjoy it.\\u201d She does that whole, \\u201cYeah. Oh, no, that\\u2019s good.\\u201d [Moaning] Ahh! \\u266a I\\u2019m having a good time \\u266a And then they\\u2019re always going, \\u201cAre you done? Are you close to done?\\u201d You never fuck a pussy and they go, \\u201cAre you almost done? Finish this.\\u201d Like that. If you\\u2019re fucking ass, they don\\u2019t want you\\u2026 They want it all over, quick. And they do other things, the porn girls. I don\\u2019t know how much they get paid. I\\u2019m sure it\\u2019s more than what the men get paid. It\\u2019s the opposite bit of society. Um\\u2026 But they do a thing called \\u201cATM.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know if you know what that is, kids. That stands for \\u201cass to mouth.\\u201d That\\u2019s where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus, and she\\u2019ll put it directly in her mouth, and she\\u2019ll say something like, \\u201cI love the taste of my ass. Let me taste my ass.\\u201d And then the man, as a favor to this woman, puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work\\u2026 [Applause] she\\u2019s been doing. Now, I had a drunken night with my ex-girlfriend where she thought she\\u2019d be all wild and try that. Once again, vastly different experience. I\\u2019m not a big fan of the ass fucking, and I don\\u2019t know of any man, if they\\u2019re truthful, really is. Now, there\\u2019s women in the room who are thinking, \\u201cWell, why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass?\\u201d [Woman shouting] What a good question. [Woman whoops] Women, the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because\\u2026 we know you fucking hate it. [Cheering] So\\u2026 I\\u2019m a father. Um\\u2026 I love my son! I love my son the same way that I love cigarettes. I like to hold him for five minutes every hour, and the rest of the time, I\\u2019m thinking about how he\\u2019s fucking killing me. He\\u2019s a good little boy. No, he\\u2019s a great little fella. I really like him. Um\\u2026 My girlfriend super loves him, though. It\\u2019s fucking creepy. And\\u2026 I\\u2019m glad I have a son. That worked out good for me. I wouldn\\u2019t be a good father to a girl. It wouldn\\u2019t be good for me. Nothing weird. Wouldn\\u2019t fuck it. I\\u2026 I just don\\u2019t get along with women. You know how it is. I don\\u2019t want them in my house, and\\u2026 So\\u2026 Because you dream, see\\u2026 For example, okay? When Hank was born\\u2026 the couple over the road, within two weeks of Hank being born, had a baby girl, and rightly or wrongly, the first thing that went through my head was\\u2026 \\u201cAw, that\\u2019s great. I hope Hank fucks that one day.\\u201d That\\u2019s what I think\\u2026 \\u2018Cause that\\u2019s what I think about my son. I hope when he\\u2019s of age, he just fucks everything. I don\\u2019t care if my son is gay or straight. All I care about is, when he is of age, that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires. That is my dream for my son! [Audience cheering] But never in the history of fathers and daughters, has a father held his baby girl and gone, \\u201cOh, I hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life. I hope you\\u2019re never shy of a cock. I hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up.\\u201d Right, you know\\u2026 And it\\u2019s not just me. Women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well. My girlfriend goes to the gym every morning. I go there very occasionally, and when you go to the gym, there\\u2019s a little daycare cr\\u00e8che thing in the gym where you can hand your child off, and inside that daycare, there\\u2019s, like, three women in their 50s. They\\u2019re very nice ladies, and you hand your kid off and he plays. Then when you finish your workout, you come and get him. And there\\u2019s a woman that works there who just loves my son. She sees all the other kids, but she loves Hank, and Hank fucking loves her, and the two of them light up when they see each other. And it\\u2019s super cute, I bring Hank up the stairs, and he starts going, \\u201cUh, uh!\\u201d Trying to reach at her, all right? And she does this, she goes, \\u201cEveryone, my boyfriend\\u2019s here. Here\\u2019s my boyfriend. Give him here. He\\u2019s my boyfriend.\\u201d And then she kisses him, and she goes, \\u266a My boyfriend gives me kisses My boyfriend gives me kisses \\u266a It\\u2019s fucking adorable. But I tried doing that with a baby girl\\u2026 Let\\u2019s say you go to the gym and there\\u2019s a daycare, and me and a couple of my mates are working there. \\u201cHey, everyone\\u2026 me girlfriend\\u2019s here. Give her here. Give her here. She\\u2019s my girlfriend. My girlfriend gives me kisses. You know that, right? She\\u2019s always giving me kisses. Enjoy your workout. Don\\u2019t worry about a thing.\\u201d [Applause] [Cheering] So\\u2026 Also\\u2026 it\\u2019s just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter. It\\u2019s just little things. Even when they\\u2019re babies, it\\u2019s just easier. There\\u2019s a wiping technique when you\\u2019re wiping a baby\\u2019s ass. I don\\u2019t know if you have children, but this is how you do it. The baby lays on its back. You put their feet together. You lift the feet up, and then you go in and wipe. With a boy, you can wipe like that. Up and down, side to side, whatever the fuck you want, right? With a girl, you gotta wipe downward and away. Downward and away. It\\u2019s very important that you wipe away from the cunt. Very important. \\u2018Cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts. They do. They fucking hate it. Boys don\\u2019t give a shit. Fucking\\u2026 My son will have shit all over his dick and balls, and I\\u2019ll be cleaning it off under the foreskin, and he\\u2019ll be laughing like it\\u2019s the best day ever. Even at my age now, I find it funny if I have shit on my dick. If I fuck my girlfriend in the ass, I pull out, I\\u2019ve got shit on my dick, I\\u2019ll ring me mate Jason up and go, \\u201cHey, Jason\\u2026 It\\u2019s happened again. I got shit on my dick.\\u201d And he\\u2019ll tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick, and we\\u2019ll laugh and laugh and laugh. But never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and she\\u2019s thought, \\u201cOh, I can\\u2019t wait to call Karen.\\u201d [Chuckles] [Laughs] When you\\u2026 When my girlfriend got pregnant\\u2026 When you meet\\u2026 When you haven\\u2019t got a child, couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children. Whenever you meet couples with children they\\u2019re always like, \\u201cIt is the most fulfilling thing I\\u2019ve ever done with my life. My heart grows larger and larger every day.\\u201d And then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant, those same people went like this, \\u201cYou\\u2019re never gonna sleep again! [Laughs maniacally] Forget about it. It\\u2019s over. You\\u2019re not gonna sleep.\\u201d They\\u2019re constantly telling you you\\u2019re not gonna sleep. Raising a baby is not that hard. I\\u2019ll tell you what, it\\u2019s easier than a coke habit. I had a coke habit for seven-and-a-half fucking years! At least it\\u2019s not me who wakes up crying anymore! I can sleep through other people crying. I\\u2019ve had girlfriends. That\\u2019s like white noise to me. I find it soothing. See, me and my girlfriend, just two months, we went, \\u201cFuck it! Let\\u2019s have a kid.\\u201d Fucking did it, right? These other people, man\\u2026 You know these couples, and they date from high school, and then they go out for a bit longer, and then after being together for like, seven years, they go, \\u201cWe\\u2019re getting engaged. You wanna come to the party?\\u201d And you wanna say, \\u201cNo, you\\u2019re really boring and we hate you.\\u201d But you go, \\u201cOh, okay, great. You\\u2019re still together, are you? You fucked one person, have you? Oh, how exciting.\\u201d And\\u2026 And then what they do is they don\\u2019t have a kid right away because they\\u2019re still not ready. \\u201cWe have to see how our careers are going and shit.\\u201d And what they do is they get a dog, and then they act like the fucking dog\\u2019s their baby. They refer to it as their fucking baby. They send you a Christmas card of them holding the dog\\u2026 and it says, \\u201cFrom our family to yours.\\u201d And then you have a barbecue, and you invite them, the humans, right? Then they come over. This fucking dog runs in, jumping over everything, and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cWhat the fuck is this shit?\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe had to bring him. We bring our baby everywhere.\\u201d And you go, \\u201cWell, your baby is biting my actual baby. Can you control\\u2026\\u201d And then, eventually, they decide they\\u2019re gonna have a kid \\u2019cause they\\u2019ve learned so much from the dog, and then they bring the kid back, and the dog runs up, like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s happening? A new person.\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cFuck off. We don\\u2019t love you anymore. We\\u2019re going.\\u201d And they think they\\u2019ve learnt something from the dog, and they haven\\u2019t learnt anything. What happens if your girlfriend\\u2019s away on work and the dog dies? You go off, you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog\\u2026 try to pass it off as the same dog. What happens if your girlfriend\\u2019s away on work and the baby dies? Very hard\\u2026 to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have. Easier if you\\u2019re black or Asian. [Audience cheering] Boston, no! No! No! Shut up! I will not put up with racism at my shows, okay? I\\u2019m not saying \\u2019cause they look the same. I\\u2019m saying \\u2019cause they\\u2019re easier to purchase. [Audience cheering] [Audience whooping] If Angelina Jolie and Madonna have taught us anything\\u2026 it is that you can buy black and Asian people. I\\u2019m yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from Norway with a child, going\\u2026 \\u201cYolanda, quick, get Hans. Bring him over. Come on.\\u201d [Jeffries chuckles] I\\u2019m gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit. Uh\\u2026 Gun control. Now\\u2026 No, wait. Before you\\u2026 Don\\u2019t get excited because the other people have guns. The anti-gun people are like, \\u201cYeah! Do it, Jim!\\u201d No, let\\u2019s just\\u2026 [Shushes] Now, before I start saying this, I wanna say this, right? I believe in your right as Americans to have guns. I\\u2019m not trying to stop you from having guns. All I\\u2019m saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion. My opinion on the\\u2026 Oh, it doesn\\u2019t matter. I don\\u2019t like guns, right? I\\u2019m gonna say some things that are just facts, right? In Australia, we had guns, right? Right up until 1996. In 1996, Australia had the biggest massacre on Earth. It still hasn\\u2019t been beaten. And\\u2026 Now, after that, they banned the guns. Now, in the 10 years before Port Arthur, there was 10 massacres. Since the gun ban in 1996, there hasn\\u2019t been a single massacre since. I don\\u2019t know how or why this happened, uh\\u2026 Maybe it was a coincidence, right? Now, please understand that I understand that Australia and America are two vastly different cultures with different people, right? I get it. In Australia, we had the biggest massacre on Earth, and the Australian government went, \\u201cThat\\u2019s it! No more guns!\\u201d And we all went, \\u201cYeah, all right, then. That seems fair enough, really.\\u201d Now, in America, you had the Sandy Hook massacre where little, tiny children died, and your government went, \\u201cMaybe\\u2026 we\\u2019ll get rid of the big guns?\\u201d And 50% of you went, \\u201cFuck you! Don\\u2019t take my guns!\\u201d [Whooping] So, here\\u2019s where it gets confusing, right? Now, as I said, I am all for your Second Amendment rights. I think you should be able to have guns. It\\u2019s in your constitution. What I am not for is bullshit arguments and lies. There is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun, and this is the argument\\u2026 \\u201cFuck off. I like guns.\\u201d It\\u2019s not the best argument, but it\\u2019s all you\\u2019ve got. And there\\u2019s nothing wrong with it. There\\u2019s nothing wrong with saying, \\u201cI like something. Don\\u2019t take it away from me.\\u201d But don\\u2019t give me this other bullshit. The main one is, [In American accent] \\u201cI need it for protection. I need to protect me. I need to protect my family.\\u201d Really? Is that why they\\u2019re called \\u201cassault rifles\\u201d? Is it? I\\u2019ve never heard of these fucking \\u201cprotection rifles\\u201d you speak of. Protection? What the fuck are you talking about? You have a gun in your house, you\\u2019re 80% more likely to use that gun on yourself, than to shoot someone else. And people think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019d never happen to me.\\u201d You don\\u2019t know that, because you know what?\\n\\u266a From time to time We all get sad \\u266a \\n\\u266a One day you\\u2019re happy Then you\\u2019re sad \\u266a \\n\\u266a And then, uh-oh \\u266a\\nProtection. I had a break-in in Manchester, England, where I was tied up, I had my head cut. They threatened to rape my girlfriend. They came through the window with a machete and a hammer, and Americans always go, [In American accent] \\u201cWell, imagine if you had a gun.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAll right. I was naked at the time. I wasn\\u2019t wearing my holster. I wasn\\u2019t staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through.\\u201d What world do you live in where you\\u2019re constantly fucking ready? You have guns \\u2019cause you like guns! That\\u2019s why you go to gun conventions! That\\u2019s why you read gun magazines! None of you give a shit about home security. None of you go to home security conventions. None of you read Padlock Monthly. None of you have a Facebook picture of you behind a secure door going, \\u201cFucking yeah!\\u201d Like you\\u2019re going to be ready if someone comes into your house. You have it at all fucking times. By the way, most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking TV! You think that people are coming to murder your family? How many fucking enemies do you have? Jeez, you think a lot of yourself if you think everyone\\u2019s coming to murder you. See, if you have it readily available, it becomes unsafe. You have it in your bedside table, one of your kids picks it up, thinks it\\u2019s a toy, shoots another one of your kids. Happens every fucking day, but people go, \\u201cThat\\u2019d never happen in my house \\u2019cause I\\u2019m a responsible gun owner. I keep my guns locked in a safe.\\u201d Then they\\u2019re no fucking protection! Someone comes into the house, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cWait there, fuck-face! Oh! You\\u2019ve come to the wrong house here, buddy boy. I tell you what. I\\u2019m gonna fuck you up! Okay. Is it 32 to the left or 32 to the right? Your mother\\u2019s birthday? Why the fuck would I know your fucking mother\\u2019s birthday? Maybe if you didn\\u2019t leave the window open [In whining voice] \\u2018because it\\u2019s too hot in here,\\u2019 we wouldn\\u2019t be getting fucking murdered, right?\\u201d I find the NRA to be hard work. The fact that they always think the answer is more guns. After Sandy Hook happened, the NRA said, and I quote, \\u201cNone of this would have happened if the teachers had guns.\\u201d I\\u2026 I think they\\u2019re forgetting what school was like. Does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to\\u2026 Whenever she came into school, that relief teacher came, you and your friends would see her and go, [Chuckling] \\u201cOh, we\\u2019re gonna make her cry.\\u201d And then she\\u2019d stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking, and you\\u2019d go, \\u201cYou\\u2019re never getting married, are you, Miss? Never gonna happen for you.\\u201d Then she\\u2019d get back to her 1967 Volkswagen Beetle, and she\\u2019d be crying over the steering wheel, just, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t they like me?\\u201d Let\\u2019s give that cunt a gun and see how things work out! [Audience cheering] And then they go, \\u201cOh, well, answer to that, we\\u2019ll just add more guns.\\u201d They go, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll put an armed security guard at every school across America.\\u201d Yeah, that\\u2019ll work out. The average security guard in America earns $16 an hour. Not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero! Someone comes onto the school and\\u2026 [Mimicking machine gun] And you\\u2019ve got Kevin. Now, I\\u2019m sure Kevin\\u2019s shit-hot at Call of Duty, but it might not fucking cut it, ladies and gentlemen. Now, I understand that when I\\u2019m doing this joke in this room, 50% of you agree with me, 50% of you don\\u2019t agree with me, and I do respect the people who don\\u2019t agree with me. Don\\u2019t think I don\\u2019t. Out of the 50% that don\\u2019t agree with me, 20% of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and it\\u2019s not to be taken seriously, and they\\u2019re laughing along \\u2019cause it\\u2019s just funny jokes, right? And then the next 20%, have sort of phased out a little bit. They\\u2019re looking around, going, \\u201cWonder how they got that chandelier up there?\\u201d And then\\u2026 there\\u2019s the last 10%. And they\\u2019re fucking furious. Right now, in this room and the people watching at home\\u2026 10% of you are fucking seething. Just\\u2026 And for a couple of reasons. First reason, I\\u2019m making good points. [Audience cheering] Second reason. Second reason. Second reason, and this is the big one, I\\u2019m foreign\\u2026 and that\\u2019s pissing the fuck out of you right now, and your brain is on a loop and you can\\u2019t fucking turn it off, and it\\u2019s just going around in a circle, and you\\u2019re just going, \\u201cIf you don\\u2019t like it, go home! If you don\\u2019t like it, go home!\\u201d And my answer to that is, \\u201cNo.\\u201d I came here legally. I pay my taxes. I\\u2019ll say whatever the fuck I want. Your First Amendment means that I can say the Second Amendment sucks dicks. And\\u2026 unless you\\u2019re an American Indian, you\\u2019re a fucking immigrant as well, so fuck off. People get so precious about it. I understand that to Americans, your constitution is very important. I respect it, but please understand that every country has one as well. It\\u2019s no more special than any other constitution. We have one in Australia. I don\\u2019t know what it says. I\\u2019ve never seen it. If there\\u2019s a problem, we\\u2019ll check it, but everything\\u2019s going fine. And don\\u2019t get me wrong. I get that the constitution is important to you. I have had\\u2026 Fucking, I get it, right? I\\u2019ve had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as I\\u2019m leaving the theater, going, [In American accent] \\u201cYou cannot change the Second Amendment!\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, you can. It\\u2019s called an \\u2018amendment.'\\u201d If you can\\u2019t change something that\\u2019s called an \\u201camendment\\u201d, see, many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution. And if you don\\u2019t know what a thesaurus is, get a dictionary and work your way forward. Don\\u2019t think your constitution is set in stone. You\\u2019ve changed things before. You used to have prohibition in there, right? And then people were like, \\u201cHey, who likes getting fucked up? Yeah, I like getting fucked up, too. Let\\u2019s get that one out. Let\\u2019s get that one out.\\u201d You used to have this other thing in America called, uh\\u2026 slavery! And then Lincoln came along and went, \\u201cThat\\u2019s it. No more slaves!\\u201d And 50% of you went, \\u201cFuck you! Don\\u2019t take my slaves!\\u201d And the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns. \\u201cWhy should I have my slaves taken off me? I\\u2019m a responsible slave owner. I\\u2019m trained in how to use my slaves safely. Just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesn\\u2019t mean that my rights should be taken away from me. I\\u2026 I use my slaves to protect my family! I keep my slaves locked in a safe!\\u201d That\\u2019s the thing. \\u201cWhy should I have my guns taken off me? I\\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\\u201d Look, I agree with you. If you\\u2019re a responsible gun owner and you don\\u2019t fuck around with them, then you should be allowed your guns. You really should. But that\\u2019s not how society works. We have to play to the 1% that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us. We have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving, right? I take drugs like a fucking champion, right? [Audience cheering] We should all be allowed to take fucking drugs, but we can\\u2019t, can we? Because Sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids. Oh! \\u201cOh, thanks, Sarah. You fucked it up for everyone.\\u201d Right? Everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it, right? But we can\\u2019t because Jonathan got drunk and ran over a family. \\u201cThanks, Jonathan! Now I have to drive at 30, you fucking idiot!\\u201d See, that\\u2019s the thing. \\u201cWhy should I have my guns taken off me, I\\u2019m responsible, just because that guy\\u2019s crazy?\\u201d Who\\u2019s to say you\\u2019re not crazy? That\\u2019s the thing about crazy people. They don\\u2019t know they\\u2019re crazy. That\\u2019s what makes them crazy. The only thing you know for sure on this Earth is, \\u201cI think, therefore I am.\\u201d You know that you exist. Anything past that is open to interpretation, right? You know you exist and that\\u2019s it. Right now, I think I\\u2019m in Boston talking to 1,200 people. That\\u2019s what I think I\\u2019m doing, but there is a good to fair chance that I\\u2019m in a mental home, standing in front of a white wall, going, [Slurring speech] \\u201cI hate guns. I hate guns. I hate guns.\\u201d [Audience applauding] See, one of the better arguments is, \\u201cWell, if you take the guns away, then only the criminals will have guns.\\u201d Not true. When they banned the guns in Australia, it worked. When they banned them in Britain, it worked, okay? The Bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in Sandy Hook costs, like, $1,000 American and you can buy it in Walmart. It\\u2019ll be delivered to your house. That\\u2019s it, man. 1,000 bucks, right? That same gun in Australia on the black market costs $34,000. Now if you have $34,000, you don\\u2019t need to be a criminal. You\\u2019ve got $34,000. You\\u2019re a great little saver. Keep going. So that covers the criminals, but that doesn\\u2019t cover the people who wanna murder your family, that are coming after you and your family. It kind of does. The people who do the massacres, it covers them \\u2019cause they go\\u2026 The kid at Colorado who thought he was The Joker, let\\u2019s say that he had some social issues. The kid at Sandy Hook was Asperger\\u2019s as fuck. Right? I don\\u2019t know if you know a lot about the black market, but you can\\u2019t just rock up at the docks going, [Slurring speech] \\u201cGuns! Who wants to sell me a gun?\\u201d Now, I\\u2019m gonna wrap this up. We won\\u2019t talk about it anymore. Now\\u2026 See, the one thing that I do really agree with with the right to bear arms, I really agree with\\u2026 That the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government. In case the government became a bunch of cunts, you could all get your guns and fight back, and that\\u2019s why it was written. \\u2013 [Audience cheering] \\u2013 Yeah! And that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets. But you do know the government has drones, right? You get that? You\\u2019re bringing guns to a drone fight! If we went back to muskets, I\\u2019m all for it! Keep the Second Amendment. If we all have muskets\\u2026 Muskets are awesome! Every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times. You know what\\u2019s good about the musket? It gives you a lot of time to calm down. Someone calls your wife fat, and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cFuck you, buddy! Ah, you\\u2019re not a bad guy. You\\u2019re all right.\\u201d Now\\u2026 after the show, we\\u2019re gonna go out, have a big party around Boston, see how it goes. I\\u2019m not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore. My girlfriend has said that\\u2019s a no\\u2026 \\u2019cause I don\\u2019t behave myself in there, so I\\u2019m not allowed to go to them anymore. \\u2018Cause strip clubs aren\\u2019t what women think they are. [Stammers] It used to be like\\u2026 Okay, so, when a man goes to a strip club, it\\u2019s all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible. That\\u2019s what men want to see. Women, when they go to their Magic Mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are\\u2026 women wanna see a guy, \\u201cHey, ladies. He\\u2019s a fireman.\\u201d And he comes out with his hose and like that\\u2026 And whenever a stripper takes their clothes off, they\\u2019ve still got the fireman\\u2019s hat on or a tool belt on or policeman\\u2019s gun on a holster, right? Because even when a man\\u2019s naked, a woman wants to know that he has a job. When men watch strippers, we want them to have a job, and that job\\u2019s stripping. We want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money, and just go\\u2026 \\u201cYou can\\u2019t take care of your kids.\\u201d It\\u2019s\\u2026 And when men get private dances in these strip clubs, I don\\u2019t know\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms, but basically, it\\u2019s dry humping. There\\u2019s no dancing. The girl gets in front. She gets where your cock is, pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it\\u2026 and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face, and you go\\u2026 That\\u2019s what a private \\u201cdance\\u201d is, right? I don\\u2019t know if there\\u2019s private dancing in female strip clubs. [Stammering] I can\\u2019t imagine that there would be. I don\\u2019t imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going\\u2026 She goes, \\u201cHow was it?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cWell\\u2026 he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals\\u2026 and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead. I got to go to the ATM.\\u201d So Legit got canceled. [Audience booing] Yeah. I know. I know it. Who would\\u2019ve thought it would\\u2019ve struggled on that great FXX channel that everyone knew about? The first season is on Netflix. This special is being recorded for Netflix. So you can go watch it there if you\\u2019re watching the special. It was\\u2026 I\\u2019m very proud of it. We had two great seasons of really good television, and if people didn\\u2019t\\u2026 Now\\u2026 The whole TV show is based around one standup routine that I used to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that I took to a brothel, which is a true story. And so, when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who\\u2026 In the end, we used DJ Qualls, and DJ Qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie Road Trip. He\\u2019s the skinny white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow, and he\\u2019s the white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow. Now\\u2026 the great thing about DJ is\\u2026 he already looks disabled. He has that \\u201clatter stages of AIDS\\u201d thing going on. It\\u2019s great for casting. Anyway, but\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t want DJ to begin with. I wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic, and the Actors\\u2019 Union of America said, \\u201cYou cannot do that.\\u201d Because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy, I think, are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired. And I said, \\u201cAll right, what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer?\\u201d And they sent me a list. And on this list, I said, \\u201cCan you get rid of all the contagious ones? And what have we got left?\\u201d So I saw every disabled actor in Hollywood, and I\\u2019ll be honest with you, not that many of them. I don\\u2019t know why. Maybe they\\u2019re just lazy. They don\\u2019t wanna work. Maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly. And none of them were very good, either. Everyone we saw, none of them were very good \\u2019cause acting is all about what you do with your hands. None of them knew what to do with their hands, and\\u2026 they all came in. Until this one guy came in. I had seen a lot of people that day. This guy was the most disabled person I\\u2019d ever seen in my life. He was like\\u2026 Think of the most disabled person you\\u2019ve seen, then double it. \\u2026really super disabled. He was shaped like a pretzel. He was being carried in by this big Russian nurse, carried him in. He made that great disabled sound of\\u2026 [Groans] That one. I just loved him. Anyway\\u2026 so he comes in for the audition\\u2026 and I\\u2019m sitting there, and we\\u2019re doing the lines together, and at first, I didn\\u2019t know if he was mentally all there either, so I was being a little bit patronizing. I was going, \\u201cThank you so much for coming in.\\u201d And then we did the dialog together, and I didn\\u2019t have to worry about a thing. This kid was funny. He was smart. His timing was impeccable. I thought he was just great, and I helped him out of the room, and I come back to the director and I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s our guy. That\\u2019s who we gotta pick.\\u201d And he agreed, but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room. So the next bloke wheels himself in. Now, obviously, he\\u2019s just a paraplegic if he\\u2019s wheeling himself in, which means the waist down, and that didn\\u2019t really suit me because\\u2026 paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance. But I thought\\u2026 \\u201cIf he\\u2019s a good enough actor, maybe he can quad-up for the role.\\u201d So he comes in\\u2026 He comes in, I shake his hand, and his leg slightly comes out at the same time. And I went, \\u201cWhoa! What\\u2019s going on there, kicky?\\u201d And he goes\\u2026 \\u201cOh, you got me! I\\u2019m not disabled.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re fucking what now?\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cI\\u2019m not disabled. I just really wanted the role, so I rented a wheelchair.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cJust shut up. So let me\\u2026 This is how your day has mapped-out thus far. You woke up this morning. You drove to the wheelchair rental place. You rented a wheelchair. You carried it out, I assume. You put it in the trunk of your car. You drove here. You got the wheelchair out. You carried it up three flights of stairs. You went to the waiting room. You put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse. Then you sat in it and practiced your lines.\\u201d And he went\\u2026 \\u201cYeah.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re a fucking asshole, mate. Get the fuck out of here.\\u201d And I kicked him out. And later on that day, I\\u2019m sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors I\\u2019m gonna call to tell them they\\u2019ve got parts, and I\\u2019m holding this disabled guy\\u2019s headshot, and I just think, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna call this guy up. I\\u2019m gonna change his life. This is an awesome moment, right?\\u201d And I\\u2019m looking at it, and he looks super handsome in his headshot. He looked really like\\u2026 And I thought, \\u201cThis has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history.\\u201d The shutter on his camera has gotta be like\\u2026 [Mimicking camera shutter] Like\\u2026 [Audience applauding] And then I read the guy\\u2019s biography\\u2026 and then it dawned on me. \\u201cThis guy\\u2019s not disabled either! I hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair! This cunt rented a nurse!\\u201d Do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse? I\\u2019m all for a method actor. Get into character three hours before, but once you finish the audition, stand up and go, \\u201cTa-da!\\u201d And we would have gone, \\u201cThat was very good.\\u201d But I\\u2019ll tell you what you don\\u2019t do. Don\\u2019t make me carry you to your car! I carried him down three flights of stairs going, \\u201cYou did very good.\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cThank you, Jim.\\u201d [Laughing] [Chuckles] I was, uh\\u2026 I go to a therapist\\u2026 \\u2019cause I get depressed. So I got a therapist every now and again. I literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind.\\u201d Like just out of the movies, right? And she went, \\u201cRed,\\u201d and I went, \\u201cBlue.\\u201d And then she went, \\u201cCooking,\\u201d and I went, \\u201cFood,\\u201d and all that type of stuff. We went like this forever. And then she went\\u2026 For the last question, she went, \\u201cAnd what\\u2019s your favorite thing in the world?\\u201d And I went\\u2026 \\u201cComing on a girl\\u2019s face.\\u201d Now\\u2026 Now, I could\\u2019ve said things like\\u2026 \\u201cIce cream\\u201d is a good answer. \\u201cHank\\u201d would\\u2019ve been an excellent answer. But I said, \\u201cComing on a girl\\u2019s face.\\u201d And I\\u2019ve had six months to think about my answer, and I stand by it. \\u2013 I\\u2026 \\u2013 [Cheering] I\\u2019m not proud of it. I hate myself for thinking it. It\\u2019s such a horrible thing to do to another human. When a girl\\u2019s on her knees and you\\u2026 It\\u2019s so\\u2026 And as an atheist, I believe in Darwin and all the things that he wrote, but he never had a bit where he explained that. There was never a bit in his book where he went, \\u201cWhen a caveman loves a cavewoman, he\\u2019ll ejaculate on her face so that flies won\\u2019t come near.\\u201d There was never that\\u2026 never that moment. But, by golly, if it\\u2019s not fun. I find it\\u2026 To\\u2026 Look, to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time, may I say, \\u201cBravo!\\u201d Don\\u2019t\\u2026 don\\u2019t think what you do\\u2026 has gone unnoticed. We notice. We appreciate your work. I think you deserve a parade of some kind. During Memorial Day, after the Vietnam vets, before the First Gulf War guys, we could bring in, \\u201cAnd here\\u2019s the women who take a load on their face.\\u201d And you could march out, and married men would stand there going, \\u201cGod bless you, ladies.\\u201d [Audience cheering] I enjoy your acting that you do. The standard tongue out and the\\u2026 Like that\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know why, but I enjoy\\u2026 I know it\\u2019s a lie. I know you\\u2019re not excited, but I still appreciate the effort is what I enjoy. I love the look because it\\u2019s such a, \\u201cOh, jeez, I\\u2019m excited, too. When this come hits my face, there\\u2019s a good chance I\\u2019ll also orgasm. Anything could happen in this crazy world.\\u201d But this is what redeems us as men. This is what redeems us. Just know that the second the come shoots out of our cock and hits your face, our bodies flood with remorse. The next 20 seconds is the nicest we will ever be to you. [Men whooping] I go from being an animal to the sweetest guy on Earth. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou fucking slut\\u2026 Oh, I love you. Ah\\u2026 Uh, all right. No, no, no. Put your tongue back in. Um\\u2026 Keep your eyes shut. Just keep them shut. Uh\\u2026 All right, I\\u2019m going to get a towel. I\\u2019ll get a towel. I\\u2019ll get you a towel. All right. You\\u2019re a wonderful mother to our child.\\u201d [Laughs] [Audience cheering] See\\u2026 this is what kills me. My son will one day watch this DVD. And I\\u2019m the guy who\\u2019s meant to teach him right from wrong, and I\\u2019m there wiping come off his mother\\u2019s face. I think I did something illegal with my son the other day. I think it might be illegal. Tell me if this is illegal. All right? I\\u2019m in the shower. My girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning, and when she came back, I was in the shower, and Hank ran up, and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like, \\u201cArgh!\\u201d Like that. And I went\\u2026 [Vocalizing] And I saw his little face and I went, \\u201cHello, Hankie.\\u201d And then in the condensation, I drew a little bowtie on him\\u2026 and a little suit\\u2026 and then I gave him a voice bubble that said, \\u201cI love my daddy. Love, Hank.\\u201d But I did it so I could read it. Well, of course he could read the \\u201cK,\\u201d and\\u2026 then I stepped out. I stepped out of the bathroom and I went, \\u201cG\\u2019day, Hankie!\\u201d And he slapped my cock and he ran off. Now, is that illegal? I don\\u2019t know. Is it illegal because, A, a child touched my cock, or because, B, I found it really funny and I\\u2019ve been telling everyone. And I can\\u2019t get angry at him because his whole life, he\\u2019s been lying on mats with things dangling over. He\\u2019s been training for this his entire life. I think I\\u2019ve, uh\\u2026 I think I\\u2019ve become American, more American than I am Australian lately, and there was a moment where I tipped over where I went, \\u201cOh, I think like an American person now.\\u201d And I\\u2019m happy to do it. I just\\u2026 I\\u2019ll tell you what happened. I was flying around\\u2026 I was doing a tour of Australia, and I was flying domestically around Australia, and I\\u2019m so used to airports and stuff here in America that\\u2026 Okay, what happens is, when you go\\u2026 I was flying Sydney to Melbourne. When you fly domestically in Australia, you go up to the machine, put your name in, prints your ticket out, it prints your bag thing, you put the bag thing on your bag yourself, and then there\\u2019s a conveyor belt underneath. You throw your bag on. Bag fucks off. You don\\u2019t speak to anyone. Then I go up to the gate bit, and the lady\\u2019s going, \\u201cTickets, please.\\u201d And I\\u2019m holding my ID out like a fucking simpleton. \\u2018Cause I get through airports quick, man. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cFucking there you go.\\u201d And she went, \\u201cPut your ID away. I don\\u2019t need to see that.\\u201d And I went\\u2026 \\u201cI think you do.\\u201d And she went, \\u201cI don\\u2019t\\u2026 Why would I need to see your ID?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI might be a terrorist.\\u201d And she went, \\u201cWould showing me your ID stop you from blowing the plane up?\\u201d \\u201cNo, I\\u2019d probably still blow the plane up.\\u201d So then I get up to the TSA conveyor belt thing, and I\\u2019m so good at the airports. I\\u2019m already taking my shoes off as I\\u2019m walking, right? And all the Australians behind me assume that I\\u2019m American, and they\\u2019re losing their fucking shit. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, for fuck\\u2019s sake! One of these cunts, eh?\\u201d And the TSA guy goes, \\u201cHey, mate, what are you taking your shoes off for?\\u201d And I went\\u2026 [Shouting] \\u201cI don\\u2019t know! Maybe they\\u2019re bombs?\\u201d And he went\\u2026 \\u201cBut they\\u2019re not, are they?\\u201d I put me shoes back on. I get my laptop out. Everyone\\u2019s going mental. And the TSA guy says, very politely, but extraordinarily sarcastically, he goes, \\u201cJeez, mate. That\\u2019s a nice computer. Why are you showing it to everyone?\\u201d \\u201cIt might also be a bomb.\\u201d And then the guy said the most Australian thing I\\u2019ve ever heard come out of anyone\\u2019s mouth ever. He went\\u2026 \\u201cOh, come on, mate. You wouldn\\u2019t have two bombs.\\u201d [Audience laughing] [Chuckles] I\\u2019m not even quite sure what that means, but it does make some type of sense. All right. Oscar Pistorius. If you haven\\u2019t been following the case, you\\u2019re missing out. This is the greatest thing since OJ Simpson. You\\u2019re fucking missing out, mate. If you don\\u2019t know who Oscar Pistorius is, let me fill you in. Oscar Pistorius is a legless man from South Africa, known as the Blade Runner. He ran in two Olympics, the disabled and the able-bodied Olympics in one year. No one has ever done that. He\\u2019s an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and able-bodied people alike, and on Valentine\\u2019s Day last year, he shot and killed the hottest girl on Earth\\u2026 and that\\u2019s when he became an inspiration to me\\u2026 \\u2019cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long. Let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there. You can\\u2019t just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want. [Mock tearfully] People have feelings, you cunts. Now, there\\u2019s a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day. One of the theories is that they found in her phone\\u2026 He went through her phone, and on her phone, he found some text messages from a South African rugby player on Valentine\\u2019s Day, right? Now, I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever been to South Africa, but in South Africa, rugby is more popular than legless running. It goes, rugby, legless running, cricket. Legless running\\u2019s their second sport. You wouldn\\u2019t have thought that. Anyway\\u2026 I\\u2019m going to reenact what I believe happened that day. To do that, I will now be doing a South African accent. Now I know, many of you can\\u2019t tell the difference between my accent and a South African accent. Here\\u2019s the difference. Picture my accent, but I\\u2019m punching a black person. What I\\u2019m trying to say is South Africans are horrible people. So\\u2026 she\\u2019s coming out of the shower. She\\u2019s been drying her hair. She\\u2019s listening to Rodriguez or something. She comes out. He\\u2019s laying on the bed. He looks up at her, he\\u2019s holding the phone, and he goes, [In South African accent] \\u201cWhat the fuck is this? I\\u2019ve been through your phone. You have been texting a rugby player.\\u201d And she\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh! Fuck you! Who the fuck do you think you are?\\u201d \\u201cWho am I? I\\u2019m Oscar Pistorius, the greatest legless runner that has ever been. That\\u2019s who the fuck I am.\\u201d \\u201cWell, I would rather be with a rugby player. At least he is a whole man, not a three-quarter man like you.\\u201d \\u2013 [Audience exclaiming] \\u2013 I know. [Audience laughing] \\u201cOh! Fuck you!\\u201d \\u201cNo! Fuck you! I\\u2019m leaving you!\\u201d And then she storms out of the room, and then he was like\\u2026 \\u201cYou fucking bitch! [Grunts] I hate you! [Grunting] You will rue the day\\u2026 that you left Oscar Pistorius, the Blade Runner! Don\\u2019t go anywhere! [Grunting] I hate you!\\u201d That\\u2019s where he keeps his legs. All right. Then he put the blades on. \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re in trouble, missy. I tell you. I go to my gun safe.\\u201d She locked herself in the bathroom. He shot her through the bathroom door. Seems like overkill, doesn\\u2019t it? Bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them, but Oscar\\u2019s one of the few men on Earth that couldn\\u2019t kick the door in, right? He was wearing the blades, so\\u2026 Boing! Ah! So\\u2026 I think Oscar will probably go to prison. Now\\u2026 in South Africa, one in four people have AIDS. I assume it may even be worse in the prison population. Now, can I say this? Look\\u2026 I\\u2019ve never raped a man. I hate that I have to put \\u201ca man\\u201d in that sentence, but whatever. I\\u2019ve never raped a man, but\\u2026 if I was going to rape a man, it would be a legless Olympian\\u2026 \\u2019cause in prison, it\\u2019s all about getting one up on other people, and making people think you\\u2019re tough and all that. Like, \\u201cYou want to fucking rape me? I just raped an Olympian, bitch. Is that what you fucking want?\\u201d There\\u2019d be a wonderful moment\\u2026 when you\\u2019re in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a Terminator movie. [Chuckling] You know what I like about that joke? So often when you tell a joke, the rapist is the villain in the story, but not in that one. Not in that one. He\\u2019s the hero. All right, we have to get going soon. Before I leave, \\u2013 I thank you very much for coming. \\u2013 [Audience groaning] No, I said, \\u201csoon,\\u201d not \\u201cover.\\u201d It\\u2019s just soon, you cunts, so calm down. [Chuckles] [Man whistles] I always\\u2026 I always find that weird when someone, like, whistles like that. What do they think is going to happen? Like, I\\u2019m going to go, \\u201cFucking you know me, mate. I was enjoying claps and cheers, but what I needed was a high-pitched squeal noise. Thank God you came along to pick up my spirits.\\u201d [Man] Love you! All right, final story. Now, I was in South Africa again. Jeez, I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ll be working in South Africa after this special comes out. I used to do, like, one tour in South Africa every year, and I just don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019ll be invited this time. They\\u2019ll be like, [In South African accent] \\u201cWe don\\u2019t like him. He\\u2019s no good.\\u201d Anyway, so, I\\u2019m in South Africa, and I had to fly back from Cape Town to Los Angeles, which is, like, a 26-hour flight. You\\u2019ve to go up to London and go across. Cunt of a trip. Um\\u2026 But it was all right \\u2019cause I had a business class ticket, so I didn\\u2019t give a fuck. And when I travel economy, I try to dress up nice \\u2019cause I like to look good in case someone recognizes me and I might get an upgrade. But when I\\u2019ve already got a business class ticket, I try to look like a bag of shit\\u2026 \\u2019cause it\\u2019s important to me that everyone else in business class doesn\\u2019t want me there and they\\u2019re annoyed by my presence. So\\u2026 I\\u2019m wearing a white T-shirt that\\u2019s got brown stains on it with a hole in the side. I\\u2019m wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out. So, anyway, I go up to the counter, up to the business thing with the thing, and I go, \\u201cHello,\\u201d and the lady goes, [In South African accent] \\u201cOh, Mr. Jefferies, I\\u2019m so sorry, but you have been downgraded.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou what now?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cBusiness class is full. You have been downgraded.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI understand that business class is full. I bought one of the tickets that made it full.\\u201d And she went, \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, sir. There\\u2019s nothing I can do.\\u201d And then I just went, \\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\\u201d Now, you know when you\\u2019re dealing with customer service people, and they want you to swear, \\u2019cause as soon as you swear, they don\\u2019t have to engage with you anymore. They can act like they\\u2019re the first adult never to hear a swear word, and they can get really offended, right? So I went, \\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\\u201d And she went, \\u201cPlease do not speak to me that way! I have done nothing wrong!\\u201d And I said, \\u201cAre you, a white South African, telling me you\\u2019ve done nothing wrong?\\u201d Anyway\\u2026 tensions rose. The manager comes over. Big fat cunt called Simon Fulcher, right? He walks over and goes, [In South African accent] \\u201cWhat is wrong here? What is wrong?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI bought a business class ticket and I want a business class ticket.\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cWhat do you want me to do? Make a new chair for you? There are no more seats. I can\\u2019t do anything.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cI\\u2019ll tell you what I can do. Go up to the executive lounge. Have some peanuts. Enjoy a beverage. Listen to Rodriguez, and if something opens up, we will move you back up to business class. So I thought, \\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing I can do.\\u201d So I walk off with my ticket. I\\u2019m walking through the airport like, \\u201cFucking British Airways, bunch of fucking cunts.\\u201d Right? I get up to the counter. And the woman behind the counter said, \\u201cTickets, please.\\u201d And I hand over my ticket and she goes, [In South African accent] \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, sir, but this is for business class passengers only. Your ticket says \\u2018economy\\u2019 on it.\\u201d And I said\\u2026 [Inhales sharply] \\u201cI bought a business class ticket, but you people have downgraded\\u2026\\u201d And as I was doing my little speech, she looked past me and went, \\u201cNext.\\u201d [Audience exclaiming] \\u201cListen here, you fucking cunt.\\u201d [Audience laughing] All right? Now, you say \\u201ccunt\\u201d in any foreign country, people lose their fucking shit. Security came from everywhere. I was going, \\u201cDon\\u2019t you fucking come near me, cunt!\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI want to speak to Simon Fulcher,\\u201d like I\\u2019m\\u2026 And they go, \\u201cAll right.\\u201d They ring the manager up, and then they go\\u2026 He goes, \\u201cIs it the pale Australian man?\\u201d And the guy went, \\u201cYes.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve had problems with him. Let him through.\\u201d Right? So I go through. I\\u2019m sitting there, I\\u2019m eating my peanuts. And I\\u2019m just angry now, going, \\u201cFucking British Airways. Fucking cunts, fucking\\u2026\\u201d Like that. And in walks in a group of Americans, about 30 of them. You know the type, right? They all\\u2026 And whenever I see Americans abroad\\u2026 I\\u2019ll do my impersonation of any American abroad. When Americans are abroad, you\\u2019re just pointing out shit you see. You\\u2019re just walking around going, [In American accent] \\u201cOh, this is great! Look at that. That\\u2019s a chair right there. Okay. Oh, what\\u2019s that over there? Okay. Wonderful. Great.\\u201d Right? And this group walked in, and one of the women in the group went like this, she went, [In American accent] \\u201cDid anyone else see that Australian guy speaking to that lady out there? Some people have no class.\\u201d And I put my head around the pylon, and I went, \\u201cYou can fuck off and all! You don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019ve been through! I\\u2019ve been downgraded!\\u201d And as I said that, 18 other people who were given the same lie that I was given, that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class, the penny dropped. None of us are getting promoted. They all lied to us, and we formed an angry militia in seconds. It was like a scene out of Braveheart, and they all stood up and went, \\u201cFucking downgraded!\\u201d And the woman in the group was doing this, \\u201cDon\\u2019t speak to me that way. Who the hell do you think you are?\\u201d And all the men in the group were like, \\u201cHey, why don\\u2019t you shut the fuck up? Just shut the fuck up.\\u201d \\u266a It doesn\\u2019t matter These people seem very angry, so \\u266a And a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down. And, sometimes, Americans, sometimes, you can seem a little insincere. And he came up and he went, [In American accent] \\u201cHey. Hey. Yeah, I get it. [Exhales sharply] Downgraded, yeah. That really grinds my gears, I tell you that. Yeah, I would write a strongly-worded letter. I really would.\\u201d And then I thought, at least this guy\\u2019s being nice, and I said, \\u201cLook, mate, don\\u2019t worry about it. It\\u2019s not like it\\u2019s your fault.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cWhy are you in such a big group anyway?\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cOh, we\\u2019re in Neil Diamond\\u2019s band. That\\u2019s Neil Diamond\\u2019s backup singer you just called a cunt there.\\u201d And as he said that, Neil Diamond walked around the corner like a fucking superhero\\u2026 and I reacted like he was one. I went, \\u201cNeil Diamond!\\u201d And Neil Diamond went, [In husky voice] \\u201cHey, what\\u2019s going on?\\u201d And then, for a second there, there was a bit of my brain that thought maybe Neil Diamond could solve problems. And I went, \\u201cNeil! Me and all these people, we\\u2019ve been downgraded!\\u201d And Neil went, \\u201cOh! Oh, right. Uh, well, maybe that\\u2019s our fault. We decided to come back a day early.\\u201d \\u201cYou can fuck off and all, Neil Diamond!\\u201d And then a fight breaks out amongst the Neil Diamond band and the downgraded. Punches are thrown. Not by me. I don\\u2019t know if you have the Internet, but I\\u2019m not much of a fighter. I\\u2019m an excellent scurrier-awayer. I get down. \\u201cHey, what have you got there? Hiya!\\u201d Anyway, the airport police came. Three people were arrested from the downgraded\\u2026 but three people were arrested from the Neil Diamond band, and that meant that three seats opened up in business class.

Hi. Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, \\u2019cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming. Um\\u2026 It\\u2019s a very exciting day for me. It\\u2019s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought\\u2026 is \\u201cFuck you.\\u201d \\u201cFuck you. I don\\u2019t even know you, but fuck you!\\u201d \\u2018Cause I\\u2019m straight up jealous. I\\u2019m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there\\u2019s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through. And then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don\\u2019t have insomnia yet. They don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don\\u2019t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It\\u2019s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don\\u2019t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It\\u2019s coming. You don\\u2019t have HPV yet, you\\u2019re a fucking loser, all right? That\\u2019s what that says about you. A lot of men don\\u2019t know that they have HPV, because it\\u2019s undetectable in men. It\\u2019s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men\\u2019s bodies and says, \\u201cBoo!\\u201d in women\\u2019s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that\\u2019s gonna turn into cervical cancer\\u2026 \\u2026or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I\\u2019m gonna die\\u2026 or you\\u2019re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We\\u2019ll find out. Um, I can also tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I\\u2019m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I\\u2019m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that\\u2019s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That\\u2019s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I\\u2019m a horrible person, I\\u2019m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I\\u2019m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I\\u2019m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator\\u2019s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, \\u2019cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you\\u2019re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don\\u2019t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82\\u2026 manual. The manual. She don\\u2019t even know\\u2026 where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don\\u2019t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson\\u2019s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, \\u201cYou never know when you might need this.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cBut\\u2026 I do know\\u2026 that I\\u2019m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.\\u201d \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that\\u2019s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.\\u201d I grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I\\u2019m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They\\u2019re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he\\u2019s\\u2013 he\\u2019s much better looking than me, he\\u2019s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, who is that?\\u201d And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, I\\u2019m gonna trap his ass.\\u201d \\u201cGoing to trap his ass!\\u201d And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, \\u201cAll right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.\\u201d When, really, it\\u2019s a public park\\u2026 \\u2026that has hosted many reggae fests\\u2026 \\u2026and has even accidentally let\\u2026 two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing\\u2026 for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to\\u2026 It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had\\u2026 We had so much chemistry. He was like, \\u201cHey, wassup?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWassup?\\u201d And we\\u2013 The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, \\u201cHey, can you drop me off?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhere?\\u201d He was like, \\u201cAt the park.\\u201d And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, \\u201cOh, no!\\u201d \\u201cI just fucked a homeless dude! Again!\\u201d My husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It\\u2019s\\u2026 too much. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very\\u2026 You feel very picturesque when you\\u2019re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you\\u2019re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it\\u2019s very, you know, it\\u2019s hot hookin\\u2019 up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I\\u2019m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement\\u2026 \\u2026you know, just right there, through the money hole and just\\u2026 And then also, he\\u2019s so vulnerable down there. I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cI could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!\\u201d You know? But I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home\\u2026 and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don\\u2019t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It\\u2019s\\u2026 amazing. It\\u2019s what love is built on, you know? My last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, \\u201cHold it. You guys aren\\u2019t Mexican?\\u201d Asian-American men are very underrated. I don\\u2019t know why people don\\u2019t go for them. They\\u2019re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It\\u2019s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It\\u2019s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It\\u2019s all red and inflamed and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI did not ask to be exfoliated today.\\u201d \\u201cThis is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.\\u201d And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That\\u2019s where the umami flavor comes from. I think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he\\u2019s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we\\u2019re both half-fancy Asian\\u2026 \\u2026and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn\\u2019t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!\\u201d I was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not authentic, OK?\\u201d You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, \\u2019cause it don\\u2019t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused. I grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That\\u2019s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that\\u2019s like\\u2026 \\u2026a thousand percent of your daily fiber\\u2026 and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about\\u2026 \\u2026supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it\\u2019s funny, right, because he\\u2019s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do\\u2026 makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall\\u2026 and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house. Him and I had been dating for four years and I\\u2013 I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose\\u2026 because\\u2026 I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women\\u2019s intuition. That\\u2019s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man\\u2019s head. First passively and then if he doesn\\u2019t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you\\u2019re too old and it\\u2019s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, \\u201cShut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?\\u201d And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, \\u201cOh, my God! He proposed!\\u201d \\u201cIt came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something\\u2026 that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.\\u201d Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page\\u2026 he\\u2019s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday\\u2026 because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That\\u2019s how rotten I was. People are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I\\u2019m a completely different person. You\\u2013 Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I\\u2019m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We\\u2019ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I\\u2019ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he\\u2019d become dependent on me. \\u2018Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t. I straight up don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\\u2019ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she\\u2019s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don\\u2019t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re dumb women. We don\\u2019t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.\\u201d \\u201c\\u2018Cause we\\u2019re too stupid to have any real responsibility.\\u201d And then, all these women had to show off and be like, \\u201cWe could do it! We could do anything.\\u201d \\u201cBitch, shut up!\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t tell them the secret.\\u201d They ruined it for us, and now we\\u2019re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, \\u201cDouble-income household,\\u201d I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cBut, Ali, we have so many more options now.\\u201d Oh, you don\\u2019t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it? A lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they\\u2019ll get very judgmental about housewives that we\\u2019ll see on the street. And they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cLook at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat bitch is a genius.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s not a housewife, she\\u2019s retired.\\u201d I do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It\\u2019s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it\\u2019s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don\\u2019t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don\\u2019t gotta\\u2026 \\u2026ten times a day, every day\\u2026 like you\\u2019re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don\\u2019t gotta do that. They don\\u2019t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that\\u2019s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It\\u2019s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired \\u2019cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed \\u2019cause you\\u2019re paranoid that your co-worker\\u2019s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, no! Courtney\\u2019s listening. She\\u2019s waiting. She\\u2019s timing me.\\u201d And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it\\u2019s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don\\u2019t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don\\u2019t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don\\u2019t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want. You know, it\\u2019s\\u2013 it\\u2019s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, \\u201cYou need to get to work on time.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYou need to eat bananas.\\u201d \\u201cI saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don\\u2019t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.\\u201d My father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, \\u201cHey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhy you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don\\u2019t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, \\u2018I do,\\u2019 what I really meant was, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019m done.'\\u201d I\\u2019m done. I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore and I\\u2019m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I\\u2019ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That\\u2019s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just\\u2026 Let\\u2019s redecorate. I gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I\\u2019m a\\u2013 I\\u2019m a disgusting pervert. I\\u2019m a pervert. I\\u2019m a gross filthy animal. And I think it\\u2019s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that\\u2026 y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it\\u2019s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you. I broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, \\u201cUh, you\\u2019re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist\\u2026 and posted \\u2018Tiny Asian female seeking anal\\u2026\\u2019 the Internet would crash.\\u201d \\u201cAnd all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.\\u201d They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know\\u2026 freaked out about anal. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, I don\\u2019t wanna do that. I\\u2019m scared of\\u2013 of the pain.\\u201d You ain\\u2019t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You\\u2019re not scared of the pain. What you\\u2019re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You\\u2019re scared that he\\u2019s gonna see that and that\\u2019s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can\\u2019t help you now. But don\\u2019t worry, \\u2019cause when he puts it in the butt, all he\\u2019s thinking about is, \\u201cI just put it in her butt.\\u201d \\u201cI gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.\\u201d You\\u2019re\\u2013 If you\\u2019re married, you\\u2019re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don\\u2019t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you\\u2019ll feel like you\\u2019re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I\\u2019m a little bit\\u2026 \\u2026stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, \\u201cOh, my God! It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m going back in time!\\u201d \\u266a A whole new world \\u266a It was magical. A big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to\\u2026 Now, if you haven\\u2019t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your\\u2013 Just give your man a little\\u2013 a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you\\u2019ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You\\u2019ll get a lot of \\u201cNo! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don\\u2019t\\u2013 No! I don\\u2019t! I don\\u2019t! No!\\u201d They get all squirmy wormy because\\u2026 they\\u2019re scared. They\\u2019re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they\\u2019re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man\\u2019s eye like he\\u2019s discovered nirvana. And it\\u2019s like you\\u2019re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know? My husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When\\u2013 When I\\u2019ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. \\u201cHey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?\\u201d I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cYes, I know you respect me and that\\u2019s why you need to abuse me. OK?\\u201d \\u2018Cause it\\u2019s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their\\u2013 Glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 It\\u2019s because we\\u2019re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t wanna die! Don\\u2019t kill me! I don\\u2019t wanna die!\\u201d But I also don\\u2019t want to be sure that I\\u2019m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just\\u2013 Just choke me enough so that I can\\u2019t talk. \\u2018Cause if I can talk, I\\u2019m gonna tell you what to do. And I\\u2019m tired of being the boss. I\\u2019m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I\\u2019m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it. Sheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word \\u201cbossy\\u201d in elementary schools, because according to her, it\\u2019s sexist to use the word \\u201cbossy,\\u201d because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re bossy,\\u201d you\\u2019re supposed to say, \\u201cYou have executive leadership skills.\\u201d Which is a very roundabout way of saying: \\u201cYou\\u2019re a little cunt.\\u201d I\\u2019m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I\\u2019m talking about? I\\u2019m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That\\u2019s the kind of income bracket I\\u2019m striving for. That\\u2019s when you know you\\u2019ve made it, when you\\u2019re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango\\u2026 \\u2026Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess. I have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran. So, I don\\u2019t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It\\u2019s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics\\u2026 don\\u2019t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There\\u2019s\\u2013 None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That\\u2019s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they\\u2019ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cGuys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby\\u2019s a little piece of shit. It\\u2019s so annoying and boring.\\u201d And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s hilarious. I identify.\\u201d And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper \\u2019cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby\\u2019s head shredding it up. She\\u2019s busy. So, I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, \\u201cAli, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become\\u2013 You\\u2019re gonna disappear, and you\\u2019re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s the dream.\\u201d That\\u2019s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know? Another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, \\u201cWhy are you gonna have a kid? Why don\\u2019t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s cool\\u2026 until my husband dies.\\u201d Which he\\u2019s definitely gonna before me. Because I\\u2019m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I\\u2019m a billion. I\\u2019m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase \\u201cblack don\\u2019t crack.\\u201d Well, Asian don\\u2019t die. We don\\u2019t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we\\u2019re such bad drivers? Because we\\u2019re trying to die. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!\\u201d \\u201cImma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna make a right turn\\u2013 I changed my mind, it\\u2019s a U-turn!\\u201d \\u201cI changed my mind again. It\\u2019s a O-turn!\\u201d Every time I get into a car accident\\u2026 \\u2026I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, my God, not again!\\u201d I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn\\u2019t see that it\\u2019s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There\\u2019s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there\\u2019s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with me, but I\\u2019m still here, you know? I need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It\\u2019s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. \\u2018Cause she knows that she\\u2019s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I\\u2019m just kidding. She doesn\\u2019t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I\\u2019m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn\\u2019t around to support me anymore. I\\u2019m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That\\u2019s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don\\u2019t give a fuck. They got no shame. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna recycle\\u2026 go bald\\u2026 go to the park, do this shit.\\u201d They do that \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a free activity. For them. They do it in their\\u2013 their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who\\u2019s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity. I also decided to have a kid because uh, I\\u2019m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it\\u2013 And it scared me. Like, I\\u2019m only 33 and\\u2026 \\u2026my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It\\u2019s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just\\u2026 \\u201cI slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what kind of mother I\\u2019m gonna be. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that\\u2026 is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker\\u2019s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. \\u201cUh, mmm.\\u201d They watch Property Brothers, scratch, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s crackin\\u2019? Mmm.\\u201d Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, \\u201cWhen can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026smell my fingers?\\u201d Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, \\u2019cause you gotta check that it\\u2019s all good in the hood. If it\\u2019s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD. When my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, \\u201cOh, my God, that\\u2019s so hot. You guys doin\\u2019 a lot of fuckin\\u2019?\\u201d No, dude. That\\u2019s\\u2013 That\\u2019s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in\\u2013 When you\\u2019re in your 30s, and you\\u2019ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin\\u2019. It tells you when it\\u2019s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not fuckin\\u2019. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it\\u2019s like, \\u2018Release the Kraken!'\\u201d And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um\\u2026 yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn\\u2019t even have sex, \\u2019cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cOK, it\\u2019s go time,\\u201d and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s not because they\\u2019re in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s because they\\u2019re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn\\u2019t have to see the expression on my face that says, \\u201cPlease, hurry the fuck up.\\u201d And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It\\u2019s when they get that\\u2026 that stupid-ass look on their face\\u2026 \\u2026where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just\\u2026 And then, because we\\u2019re hippies, I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cHey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?\\u201d And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him\\u2026 and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards\\u2026 to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That\\u2019s right. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\\u2019m very grateful to be pregnant and to be\\u2026 this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, my God. That\\u2019s so dark and terrible. I can\\u2019t believe that.\\u201d I\\u2019m 33. Girl, when you\\u2019re 33, you\\u2019ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It\\u2019s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn\\u2019t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom\\u2013 She\\u2019s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, \\u201cUh, yeah. Where I\\u2019m from, that\\u2019s like losing a pair of shoes. It\\u2019s whatevs, OK?\\u201d And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, \\u201cOh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you\\u2019re having twins.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo!\\u201d And then she said, \\u201cBut what I don\\u2019t see is a heartbeat.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cYes!\\u201d \\u201cThe Lord is mysterious!\\u201d Don\\u2019t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I\\u2019ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won\\u2019t let their husbands watch when they\\u2019re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, \\u201cYou look.\\u201d \\u201cYou watch the whole thing.\\u201d And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyonc\\u00e9. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That\\u2019s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted. I\\u2019m scared about giving childbirth, though. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m very, very scared of childbirth. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That\\u2019s a white hippie witch\\u2026 \\u2026that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser S\\u00f6ze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, \\u201cAli, did you know that you\\u2019re gonna poop on the table?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, I look forward to it.\\u201d I\\u2019m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can\\u2019t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you\\u2013 that that happens because when you\\u2019re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that\\u2019s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That\\u2019s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn\\u2019t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. \\u201cHey, can you wash the dishes?\\u201d \\u201cNo!\\u201d \\u201cCan you water the plants?\\u201d \\u201cI am not doing jack shit anymore. I\\u2019m busy makin\\u2019 a eyeball, OK? Are you makin\\u2019 a foot? I didn\\u2019t think so. You change the channel.\\u201d I can already see how there\\u2019s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor\\u2019s appointments with me. \\u201cOh, my God. I can\\u2019t believe he comes to all your doctor\\u2019s appointments. He is so supportive.\\u201d Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I\\u2019m the star of the show. There\\u2019s nothing for the camera to see if I\\u2019m not there. But he\\u2019s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I\\u2019m a bad mommy. You know, I\\u2013 I\\u2013 I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I\\u2019m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis\\u2026 to keep him down so that he doesn\\u2019t believe that he\\u2019s worthy of another woman\\u2019s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don\\u2019t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn\\u2019t know that. I didn\\u2019t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big\\u2013 they get big, like fingers. Like, \\u201cYou, you. You owe me money, you.\\u201d My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I\\u2019m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it. Now that I\\u2019m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy\\u2019s all wet again. But it\\u2019s different. It\\u2019s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, \\u201cWhy is it different?\\u201d And I looked it up, and my pussy\\u2019s all wet again because my\\u2013 my body\\u2019s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That\\u2019s not the same. When it\\u2019s straight up soldier glue, when it\\u2019s Neosporin. So, you know, I\\u2013 I, in\\u2013 previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who\\u2019s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he\\u2019s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron\\u2019d my ass. And now, if I don\\u2019t work, we die. Why else do you think I\\u2019m performing seven and a half months pregnant? All right, I\\u2019ve been Ali Wong.

Thanks. Thank you, guys. Hey, Seattle. Nice to see you. Look at this. Look at us. We\\u2019re here. This is crazy. It\\u2019s insane. So about five years ago, pretty much everyone who I know started to get married, and that was strange for me because I don\\u2019t really believe in the idea of marriage. And that would have been fine, except I have a problem where sometimes when I think that I am right about something, it can be a real source of tension between me and the person I\\u2019m arguing with. And the reason it\\u2019s a source of tension is that I\\u2019m right. And so I remember distinctly talking to my friend Dana, and she goes, \\u201cWell, you don\\u2019t believe in marriage for you, but, of course, you believe in it for other people.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo, I think it\\u2019s insane, you know, for anyone.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cWhy?\\u201d\\nAnd I said, \\u201cWell, first of all, it just seems doomed.\\u201d You know, 50% of marriages end in divorce. That\\u2019s just first marriages, by the way. Second marriages, 60% to 62% end in divorce. Third marriages, 70% to 75% end in divorce. That\\u2019s a learning curve.\\nSecond of all, monogamy\\u2019s impossible, or at the very least, not a sure thing. When I say that, I think people assume that I\\u2019m implying that men are incapable of being faithful. I think women are just as incapable, but for more sophisticated reasons, you know. I mean, with men, we\\u2019re just really simple. We have a very simple sexuality. When I say that, my female friends are like, \\u201cWell, we like sex just as much as you do.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cSure, but it\\u2019s different.\\u201d And they say, \\u201cHow?\\u201d And I say, \\u201cHave you ever masturbated while driving a car?\\u201d\\nNumber three\\u2026 I\\u2019m never gonna be happy. Why would anyone want to be a part of that? I think that\\u2019s not brought up often enough. I, um, I didn\\u2019t know that would be the reaction. Oh, no, that\\u2019s the hopeful part. The, uh\\u2026 I had one ally in all this, which is my friend Andy, and he\\u2019s a comedian as well. Not only did we decide we weren\\u2019t gonna get married, we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married. Yeah, we were pretty good at it. Like, we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages, you know. We were\\u2026 we were pretty good. I mean, we weren\\u2019t like the best in the world. I\\u2019m sure there are better in Europe. But we were\\u2026 we were solid, you know. Like, so, like, for example, at point my friend Alex was about to get engaged. And so we just took him to dinner. And during dessert, we gave him a long, hard stare. We said, \\u201cAre you sure this is what you want to do?\\u201d And then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we weren\\u2019t friends anymore. So February 27, 2007, I\\u2019m at Andy\\u2019s house in Los Angeles. And earlier in the night, I got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone, and it was a bad one because I knew that I was right. And Andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation \\u2019cause he\\u2019s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether you\\u2019re right. He says stuff like, \\u201cShe sounds crazy.\\u201d Like, even if what she\\u2019s saying isn\\u2019t that crazy, like, you\\u2019d be like, \\u201cShe only eats whole wheat bagels.\\u201d He\\u2019d be like, \\u201cShe sounds crazy!\\u201d You\\u2019d be like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not even the crazy part!\\u201d You know. So I\\u2019m telling him about his argument. And he goes, \\u201cYou\\u2019re right.\\u201d I go, \\u201cI know. I\\u2019m right.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cYeah, you\\u2019re right.\\u201d I go, \\u201cI know I\\u2019m right. I got to tell her about this in the morning.\\u201d And I get in my rental car to head back to my hotel, and I\\u2019m driving out of Andy\\u2019s small road, and I\\u2019m t-boned! I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019re familiar with this term, uh\\u2026 This is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driver\\u2019s side at a 90-degree angle, like a t-bone steak. And in 1 1/2 seconds, I\\u2019m spun around, and I think I\\u2019m dead. No, wait, I\\u2019m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. And then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. I know. Let me tell you how this argument started. I met Jenny in St. Louis. My friend Andy and I were working for her company. They were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches, which is really my demographic. I, uh\\u2026 No, I was very nervous about this. I was actually kind of about to go onstage, and I was, like, scrawling notes on my napkin. A lot of times I\\u2019ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary. And Jenny looked at me, and she goes, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI\\u2019m writing my set list.\\u201d And then she goes, \\u201cI think it\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo, it won\\u2019t be fine.\\u201d And then she was like, \\u201cI think it will be okay.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cWhy do you think that?\\u201d And she said, \\u201cWell, you look so nervous, I think they\\u2019ll feel sorry for you.\\u201d But Jenny has this really soft, sweet voice, like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything. At one point, she said, \\u201cIt seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage.\\u201d Normally, I\\u2019d be offended by that, but in this instance, I was like, \\u201cYou are right. That is a great point. You are beautiful, you know.\\u201d She re\\u2026 she really was. You know, from the moment I met Jenny, I knew I wanted to sleep with her at least once. Stay with me. Uh, I mean\\u2026 I mean that in, like, in the most meaningful way. Like, that was the most that I was capable of in my life at that point. I\\u2026 I\\u2019d jus\\u2026 I\\u2019d just come off a really long, difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married, and\\u2026 and then we weren\\u2019t. And then when we weren\\u2019t, I was so heartbroken, I just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely, you know, and\\u2026 But from the moment I met Jenny, I just wanted to be with her. And I didn\\u2019t\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t think it was gonna happen. Like, I don\\u2019t have that kind of confidence. I actually think of myself as a sex maybe, which is to say that if I\\u2019m seeing a girl, she\\u2019d think, \\u201cI\\u2019d have sex with him, maybe.\\u201d You know, and I\\u2019m\\u2026 I\\u2019m not ashamed of that. There were periods in my life where I was a sex never. Or a sex with self always. Yeah. And often. Surprisingly often. Yeah, I just don\\u2019t give off a great first impression. Like, I\\u2019ll give you an example. Like, this is the shirt I decided to wear tonight. Like, I didn\\u2019t\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt. I mean, this is my \\u201cA\\u201d outfit. My \\u201cB\\u201d outfit was naked. I like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that I might be a fixer-upper. I\\u2019ve reached this point in my life I don\\u2019t really look in the mirror before I leave my apartment. I glance at it to make sure I\\u2019m not bleeding. You know what I mean? Like\\u2026 But I don\\u2019t stare at the mirror. If I stare at the mirror, I get angry. Like, I feel like I\\u2019m complaining about a bad call a ref just made. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cCome on!\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re blind if you\\u2019re leaving the house like that!\\u201d And the ref is God, and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline. And it\\u2019s a close game \\u2019cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast, and I\\u2019m all riled up. I\\u2019m about to charge the field. And the guy comes by with fried dough. And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNext time.\\u201d You know, that\\u2019s how I go for fried dough, \\u2019cause I have a problem. I just\\u2026 This is ridiculous. Can you follow me over here for a second? I\\u2019m gonna jump off stage. This is only in Seattle where someone is wearing no shoes? No shoes or socks? What? Who are you people? What is wrong with you? I would expect that behavior from this guy, but not you, sir, not you! What is this? Where do you think you are? From Seattle! Yeah, Seattle. So I\\u2019ve been going, uh, recently to a women\\u2019s exercise class. I-I\\u2019ve given up on having a traditional male physique. And so now I\\u2019m going for strong, independent woman. And, uh\\u2026 It\\u2019s going pretty well, you know. I\\u2019m not as good in the class as you might think. Sometimes I\\u2019ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isn\\u2019t looking. But then when she looks over, I always have to strike a pose as though I\\u2019ve been doing what everybody else has been doing. It reminds me of the Olympics. You know how they do gymnastics, how they\\u2019ll have those\\u2026 The girls will do those crazy flips and twirls. And every once in a while\\u2026 And I\\u2019m not saying I root for this to happen, but sometimes they\\u2019ll fall, and it\\u2019s ugly \\u2019cause they\\u2019re rolling around like, \\u201cI\\u2019m in a lot of trouble. Like, I don\\u2019t even know how I got here.\\u201d But at the end of that, no matter what\\u2026 And I totally fall for it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cthat can\\u2019t possibly be the same loser \\u201cFrom moments ago. \\u201cI mean, that\\u2019s a completely different person. \\u201cThis person has much better posture, for starters.\\u201d I really wanted Jenny to come out with me and Andy that night in St. Louis \\u2019cause we were going out to one of these famous Irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak. And so I thought that might work to my advantage. I don\\u2019t know, and, uh\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t have the nerve to ask her myself, and so I convinced Andy to ask her for us. And, uh\\u2026 Pfft. Which\\u2026 yeah, I don\\u2019t know if that was the best idea \\u2019cause, uh, we\\u2019re heading\\u2026 We\\u2019re in the car heading to the pub, and Jenny says, \\u201cOh, I left my I.D. at the hotel.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cOh, we can just swing back and get it.\\u201d And she\\u2019s like\\u2026 she\\u2019s like, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cNo, it won\\u2019t be fine \\u2019cause it\\u2019s St. Patrick\\u2019s day, and there\\u2019s bouncers.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019ll be okay.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo, it won\\u2019t be okay.\\u201d And then we get to the pub, and it was fine. Like, the bouncer just kind of waved her through, which has not been my experience with bouncers. For me, bouncers are like prison guards. And for Jenny, they\\u2019re like birthday clowns like, you know, \\u201cWhat can I do to make your day better?\\u201d\\nYou know, and that\\u2019s\\u2026 We\\u2019re at the pub, and it had taken so much convincing for Andy to get Jenny to come out there. By the time she came out, she thought she was on a date with him. And, yeah, that wasn\\u2019t the idea. And so I said\\u2026 I had to convince him to fall away as the night went on, like the red rockets on the space shuttle. And eventually, she realized she was on a date with me, and she was not happy about that. But, uh\\u2026 But she warmed to me as the night went on \\u2019cause she was drinking, and then, like\\u2026 No, by the end of the night, we were laughing and having a good time, and we\\u2026 I caught a break, which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends, and she and I were stuffed in this little back seat together. And it was really quiet, so I could hear her soft voice. And she told me she had just come off a long, difficult breakup, and I told her about my breakup. And for a moment there in the back seat, it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart, and\\u2026 We get back to the hotel, and I offer to walk her to her room, and she says, \\u201cSure.\\u201d We get to her door, and I didn\\u2019t want this night to end. And so I build up the courage to lean in to kiss her, and she says, \\u201cOh, no, thank you.\\u201d Which I thought was polite\\u2026 But disappointing. I mean, there\\u2019s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because you\\u2019re really putting yourself out there. You\\u2019re just like, \\u201cI think we should connect mouths,\\u201d you know, and\\u2026 The other person\\u2019s like, \\u201cI do not think we should connect mouths.\\u201d And those are\\u2026 They\\u2019re two very different mouth agendas, you know. And then you just feel so stupid. You\\u2019re like, \\u201cI never should have suggested we connect mouths, you know.\\u201d This is a sore subject for me. I have sort of a long history of failed kisses. Like, I\\u2026 I remember growing up, like, when people started making out. Like, in my time in Massachusetts, it was in seventh grade. I remember\\u2026 I remember it like it was yesterday \\u2019cause I was shocked. I was like, \\u201cPeople we know are just making out with other people we know?\\u201d \\u201cBut how?\\u201d You know. It seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden. I was like, \\u201cI am not doing that.\\u201d And collectively, all the girls in my class were like, \\u201cThat is fine. \\u201cYou are not on the list. \\u201cYou\\u2019re not exactly a first-round draft pick for our new activity.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cPerfect.\\u201d It seemed so gross to me. And it still does kind of. Like, sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t like when I see two dudes making out in the street.\\u201d And I feel that way about anyone. Like, making out is just sloppy. It\\u2019s like watching a dog eat spaghetti. That\\u2019s how I make out. Is that right? Does anybody know if that\\u2019s right? Okay, good. So\\u2026 In seventh grade, I was like, \\u201cI\\u2019m not gonna make out with anybody.\\u201d And that was fine for a while, but increasingly, it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts. It was like, the make-out club and the non-make-out club. And these were informal organizations, of course. I mean, I would be sad if that were school-sanctioned, like, \\u201cwe call this meeting of the non-make-out club to order. \\u201cFirst order of business, Nintendo. \\u201cSecond order of business, why doesn\\u2019t anyone like us? Meeting adjourned.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know, it was a sad group, and we were losing good guys by the day. I feared\\u2026 I feared that soon I would be the lone member of the non-make-out club, so I was like, \\u201cI got to try to get into the make-out club.\\u201d But it was a very intangible goal. I didn\\u2019t really talk to a lot of girls, and\\u2026 There was one girl who sat in front of me in class named Lisa Bazetti who I had a huge crush on, but she was way out of my league. Like, she had many suitors. She had\\u2026 I don\\u2019t\\u2026 The rest of the show is in old English. Uh\\u2026 She doth had many suitors! Uh, no, she had many, you know, admirers. And there were three of us, really, and I was in third place in all the trade publications, but I had one advantage over these other guys, which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework, thanks to alphabetical order. Bazetti, Birbiglia. One time I said something on the phone that made her laugh, and I was like, \\u201cOh, this is great. I got to do that more.\\u201d And one time we were on the phone, and she was laughing so hard, I remember so well \\u2019cause she goes, \\u201cMike, you got to stop. I\\u2019m gonna pee myself.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cWow.\\u201d This was the closest I\\u2019d ever come to a vagina. So spent the next 15 years trying to get Lisa Bazetti to pee. And that\\u2019s how I ended up here. Yeah. That\\u2019s how we all ended up here, in a sense. So\\u2026 uh\\u2026 So here\\u2019s what happened with Lisa. One time I built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me, and she said yes. I couldn\\u2019t believe it. Like, all of a sudden I thought, \\u201cWell, maybe this will be like \\u201cone of those romantic comedy montages. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll go to the carnival, we\\u2019ll get stuck \\u201cOn the top of the Ferris wheel, we\\u2019ll make out. \\u201cIt\\u2019ll all take a minute and a half, and it will be set to Phil Collins song.\\u201d But I think that when you\\u2019re 12 years old, you just don\\u2019t understand certain things about your digestive system. You don\\u2019t know that you shouldn\\u2019t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler. Cotton candy being the most insane of these items. It\\u2019s basically saying, \\u201cWe\\u2019re gonna take sugar, \\u201cwhich everyone knows is bad, but then we\\u2019ll dress it up like insulation.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure \\u201cwhat the selling point is there. Is it the sugar or the insulation?\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe already sold it.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cwell done, way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know if you have the scrambler here in Seattle. I imagine you might. It travels on a truck. It is a very mobile scrambling unit. The premise is very simple. You just sit on a two-person pod with the person you are in love with, and that pod goes in a circle, which is part of a larger circle, which is part of an even grander circle. As I understand it, it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients. It was called the \\u201cshits of pants-erator,\\u201d and it was wildly successful. And then it was co-opted by the carnival workers of America. Cwoa. And they said\\u2026 They said, \\u201cWe like it, but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff.\\u201d And then one guy says, \\u201cWell, what about the \\u2018I think I\\u2019m gonna die-erator\\u2019?\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s good, \\u201c\\u2019cause it gets across the essence of how you feel \\u201cwhen you\\u2019re on the machine. \\u201cPlus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea, \\u201cwhich is a nice homage \\u201cto the original intention of the machine, \\u201cbut we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff.\\u201d And then one guy goes, \\u201cwell, what about the scrambler? \\u2018Cause it scrambles you!\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe get it, Frank, but who\\u2026\\u201d Frank is a maniac. This guy can\\u2019t be stopped, but every once in a while, he\\u2019s got a good idea. \\u201cBut who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment?\\u201d And this one guy goes, \\u201cwell, I have a nephew who\\u2019s 16 years old \\u201cand smokes pot 24 hours a day. I feel like he might be available.\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201che sounds amazing. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t even need to interview him. He sounds completely qualified.\\u201d\\nI sit down with Lisa on the scrambler, and I\\u2019m feeling good. Like, she\\u2019s snuggling up close to me, and I\\u2019m thinking\\u2026 I\\u2019m thinking like, \\u201cthis could be it. \\u201cThis could be where it\\u2019s all gonna happen. This is very special.\\u201d And then they put that bar seat belt down. And the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment. It\\u2019s not a Ralph Nader approved item. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s saved lives. I think the only thing it\\u2019s ever done is in a scrambler accident, it\\u2019s just sort of held someone\\u2019s esophagus down to the pavement, making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident. First rule of scrambler accident, don\\u2019t talk about scrambler accident. That\\u2019s from scrambler club. Well, I knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that I was going to throw up for sure. And I even said to the 16-year-old stoner, I was like, \\u201chey, actually\\u2026\\u201d And then he was gone. Apparently, he doesn\\u2019t enjoy the second halves of sentences.\\nSo then I\\u2019m scrambling, and\\u2026 As I am scrambling, I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cI need to come up with a plan of some kind. I\\u2019m not going down without a fight.\\u201d My first plan was very simple. It was just don\\u2019t look at Lisa, don\\u2019t look at any other people. I was like, \\u201cdon\\u2019t look at Lisa, \\u201cdon\\u2019t look at any other people. \\u201cDon\\u2019t look at Lisa, \\u201cdon\\u2019t look at any other people. I need a new plan.\\u201d And\\u2026 The new plan was I needed to tell the scrambler operator\\u2026 That he needed to stop the ride, but\\u2026 The mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window. So I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI got to tell him he\\u2019s got to stop the ride. \\u201cI got to tell him he\\u2019s got to stop the ride. \\u201cI got to tell him he\\u2019s got to stop the ride. Please stop the ride!\\u201d And I\\u2019m back! \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure he heard me. \\u201cI got to say it louder. Please stop the ride! \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure he\\u2019s paying attention. I think he might be smoking pot right now.\\u201d The third time I said, \\u201cplease stop.\\u201d And then I started throwing up, and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler, just\\u2026 Popcorn, peanuts\\u2026 Insulation. Really, insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa. I did not look at Lisa. But I\\u2019m pretty sure she was staring at me because I was a spectacle at that point. I was spectacular. And we did not make out. I did not lose my mouth virginity that evening. Two years later, it gets worse. Um\\u2026 I\\u2019m at the St. John\\u2019s high school, what they call a cattle call dance. This is an all boys catholic school I attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty St. John\\u2019s gymnasium like cattle, which is a friendly way to describe women, you know. So\\u2026 Cattle shows up at 8:00. We\\u2019ll make out with the cattle. Cattle goes home at 10:00. Then we go out for burgers. Completely separate from the cattle analogy. It was a horrible affair. It was just like this room chock-full of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out. At this point, I was, indeed, the lone member of the non-make-out club, but it was actually worse than that \\u2019cause I had to lie to my friends and tell them I had had my first kiss \\u2019cause it was, like, this really tough, all boys school. And so when they would ask, like, \\u201coh, have you had your first kiss?\\u201d I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cyeah, like, all the time. Like, every\\u2026 every week.\\u201d I always feared at some point there\\u2019d be a follow-up question like, \\u201coh, yeah? What\\u2019s it like?\\u201d And I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cyeah, you know, it\\u2019s just like licking an ice cream cone.\\u201d And they\\u2019d be like, \\u201cno, it\\u2019s not. It\\u2019s like sucking on a rocket pop.\\u201d And I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cah, wrong frozen dessert analogy.\\u201d I\\u2019m at the dance, and I\\u2019m flanked by my friend Sam Ricciardi. And we\\u2019re introduced by our friend Tom to these girls from his town. They were the last two cows at the dance. They were like, \\u201cmoo!\\u201d And we were like, \\u201cmoo!\\u201d And then Sam says one of these phrases I think we\\u2019ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat. He says, \\u201cyou get that one.\\u201d Which I know it\\u2019s the worst turn of phrase, but I\\u2019m comfortable saying it \\u2019cause I know I\\u2019ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me, \\u201cyou get that one.\\u201d And then her friend goes like, \\u201coof.\\u201d You know, or even worse\\u2026 or even worse, like, \\u201cyou owe me,\\u201d which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance. I would hate to hurt someone\\u2019s credit score, you know. So he goes\\u2026 he goes, \\u201cyou get that one.\\u201d And then I\\u2019m just fast dancing with this girl, Sandra, to young mc\\u2019s bust a move. And I\\u2019m not great at fast dancing, but they had the strobe light going, so it\\u2019s only catching me one out of every five\\u2026 Hey! So she\\u2019s losing interest, but at 1/5 the speed. And then I\\u2019m saved by a slow song, Stairway to Heaven, which is a classic make-out anthem. Led Zeppelin, eight minutes long. What\\u2019s great about slow dancing is you can\\u2019t really mess it up \\u2019cause it\\u2019s just sort of a slow-motion hug. Like, the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it. She\\u2019d be like, \\u201cwhat are you doing?\\u201d And I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t pick up on social cues,\\u201d you know. But it\\u2019s such a long song, you know, Stairway, so I\\u2019m just trying not to fidget. I\\u2019m sort of a fidgety person. I feared if I fidgeted too much, I might initiate the head tilt too early. I didn\\u2019t know anything about making out, but I\\u2019d seen people do it. I could see there\\u2019s, like, a head tilt. I had heard there were tongues involved. And I could see that there was, like, some kind of space in between the two mouths. To me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing. What is happening in that space? There is no\\u2026 You know, there\\u2019s no video documentation of that area. It\\u2019s like the giant squid of making out. No one has seen it alive. They\\u2019ve only seen it washed up on the shore\\u2026 Which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy, but\\u2026 So I\\u2019m trying not to fidget. Then with 1 1/2 minutes left in stairway to heaven, the song hits that crescendo\\u2026 All around me, kids start to make the tilt. Just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me. And I was like, \\u201coh, no. I don\\u2019t want to be alone anymore.\\u201d And I make the slightest tilt. And then Sandra comes in strong, and then it\\u2019s an all-out mouth war. And she had artillery \\u2019cause she had braces. It was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork. As this oral atrocity is taking place, all I can think is, \\u201cI\\u2019m not alone anymore! I\\u2019m not in the non-make-out club!\\u201d And all I wanted to do was tell my friends, but I couldn\\u2019t because up until that point, I\\u2019d lied and said that I\\u2019d had my first kiss. I walked off the dance floor, Sam was like, \\u201chow\\u2019d it go, dude?\\u201d I had to be like, \\u201csame as always. Pretty smooth.\\u201d As the week wore on, I started to convince myself, \\u201cwell, maybe it did go well, \\u201cand I should call Sandra, and this could bud into a relationship of some kind,\\u201d but\\u2026 I got her number from Tom, and those conversations ended up being very brief, you know. We didn\\u2019t have a lot to talk about. I remember just being like, \\u201chey, you like full house? \\u201cMe neither. Cool. All right. Later.\\u201d You know what I mean? At certain points, I remember getting this vibe from her, kind of like, \\u201cwhy are you calling me?\\u201d And I remember thinking, \\u201coh, I\\u2019m probably reading into that one too much,\\u201d and\\u2026 And then she stopped calling me back. And I was like, \\u201coh, yeah, I read into that one perfectly.\\u201d But I just felt so dumb about the whole thing, and the worst part is I couldn\\u2019t even tell my friends, until one day I was\\u2026 I was standing by my locker with my friend Tom, and so I said to him, I was like, \\u201chey, what\\u2019s going on with Sandra? Like, she hasn\\u2019t called me back.\\u201d And Tom has this knowing grin on his face. I was like, \\u201cwhat?\\u201d Tom was like, \\u201cnothing.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cwhat?\\u201d Tom was like, \\u201cnothing.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cwhat?\\u201d Tom\\u2019s like, \\u201coh.\\u201d \\u201cI talked to Sandra, and she said \\u201cyou\\u2019re the worst kisser she\\u2019s ever kissed.\\u201d And it was so devastating \\u2019cause not only was it probably true, but I couldn\\u2019t explain to my friends why it was true. I couldn\\u2019t say, \\u201cthat makes sense. I\\u2019ve never done that before.\\u201d So instead I had to play it off. I had to be like, \\u201cyeah, that sounds about right. \\u201cI\\u2019m a terrible kisser. That\\u2019s kind of my thing.\\u201d So I lean in to kiss Jenny, and she says, \\u201coh, no, thank you.\\u201d She agrees to go out with me in New York. We were both living in New York, and she gave me her number, and I typed it in my phone, and from that point on, she would be \\u201cJen, Irish pub, nice.\\u201d A few weeks later, I took her out to a restaurant I couldn\\u2019t afford to show her how much money I could put on my credit card. We\\u2019re out to dinner, and she says to me, she goes, \\u201ceveryone hates me at work,\\u201d and I said, \\u201cwhy would they hate you? I love you.\\u201d She goes, \\u201cyou love me?\\u201d I go, \\u201cI mean, you seem cool.\\u201d I pulled it back. I didn\\u2019t want to show all my cards. Just about nine of them. One of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said, \\u201cyou know, sometimes I\\u2019ll date two people at once, and that way I\\u2019m never let down by either person.\\u201d I said, \\u201cthat seems like a really smart plan. Like, I\\u2019d like to do that as well.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cI\\u2019m still kind of seeing my ex-boyfriend, John, and you can see other people too, but you have to tell me if you\\u2019re seeing them.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201call right, sounds like a plan. \\u201cGot it. Break! I got to go find some more people, you know.\\u201d And so a few nights later, I\\u2019m in another city, and I do a show, and after the show, I went out to a bar, and I ended up making out with this random girl. Then a few nights later, I\\u2019m out to dinner with Jenny, and she says, \\u201chow was your trip?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cit was great. I did some shows, \\u201cand then one night I ended up making out with this random girl.\\u201d And that didn\\u2019t go over very well in the conversation. I could sense that something was wrong. And I was like, \\u201cbut I\\u2019m right about that, right? Like, I\\u2019m supposed to tell you if that happens, right?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cyeah, but it doesn\\u2019t mean \\u201cthat I won\\u2019t lose interest in you.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cthat\\u2019s a whole new clause! \\u201cThat\\u2019s a twist! What is this, the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects?\\u201d I said, \\u201care you still seeing John?\\u201d And she said, \\u201csometimes.\\u201d I said, \\u201cwell, don\\u2019t you see the contradiction in that?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cyes.\\u201d And it gets very quiet\\u2026 Because we were falling in love. Three weeks into my relationship with Jenny, I built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to Bermuda. I wanted to show her how much more money I could put on my credit card. Since I didn\\u2019t have a lot left, we went to Bermuda \\u2019cause it was the off season. You can get these great deals online. Because as it turns out, when it\\u2019s winter in New York, it is also winter\\u2026 In Bermuda, and, uh\\u2026 Jenny and I meet up at the airport, and she\\u2019s late, which is a big pet peeve of mine. I fancy myself as a professional traveler. I\\u2019m always two hours early, I have my pocket for my ticket and my passport, and I have laceless moccasins. I never tell jokes about bombs. And\\u2026 and Jenny\\u2019s late. And then we get to security, and I\\u2019m not making this up, she doesn\\u2019t have a license or a passport. And I said, \\u201cwhat do you mean?\\u201d I go, \\u201chow do you travel?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cwell, \\u201cusually, they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work I.D.\\u201d I don\\u2019t like to dwell on the differences between men and women, but I just can\\u2019t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport, and they would let him on the plane. But women get a pass on things like this that I find completely bewildering. I mean, if I were in charge of Al-Qaeda, for example, what\\u2026 what I would do is I would recruit attractive women because they\\u2019re just not stopped under any circumstances. Although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the 72 virgins and, you know, the women wouldn\\u2019t want that, unless they\\u2019re lesbians, although there\\u2019s an idea, you know. Al-Qaeda\\u2026 Al-Qaeda could recruit hot lesbians, although\\u2026 then they\\u2019d have to guarantee that the 72 virgins are also lesbians. I mean, what are the odds, you know? All 72 virgins are also lesbians, unless you think of sexuality as, like, a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity. Like the 72 virgins are like, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t even know I was a lesbian \\u201cuntil I had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist. \\u201cAnd now that\\u2019s all I\\u2019m into. \\u201cI used to be into these Afghani guys who are so crazy, \\u201cthey\\u2019d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me \\u201cand 71 of my friends. But now I don\\u2019t see Khalid in the same way anymore.\\u201d The point is, we went to Bermuda, and we\\u2019re on the flight\\u2026 On the flight, and the flight attendant comes over, and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us. And she says, \\u201ccongratulations on your honeymoon.\\u201d And we said, \\u201coh, no, thanks. We\\u2019re not on our honeymoon.\\u201d And she walks away, and Jenny says, \\u201cthat\\u2019s so funny. I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ll ever go on a honeymoon.\\u201d And I said, \\u201coh, really?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cyeah. I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019d ever want to get married in my life.\\u201d And I said, \\u201coh, really?\\u201d I go, \\u201cme too.\\u201d I said, \\u201cis that based on a principle, \\u201cor did you have a bad relationship? Like, what was your first boyfriend like?\\u201d And\\u2026 She told me about her first boyfriend Brian. It was\\u2026 they were at the same bus stop when they were 16, and they would make out on the bus, and they were together for six years. And they\\u2026 you know, their relationship got deeper, and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together. And I said, \\u201cthen what?\\u201d And she said, \\u201che died. He had leukemia.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, do you ever talk about this with anyone?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cno, I don\\u2019t really like to talk about it.\\u201d But these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where Jenny was opening up to me, and I was opening up to her. And every night we\\u2019d be up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and we were so happy, we\\u2026 At one point, I was like, \\u201cwell, we should do this again. \\u201cWe should go on another trip. And you could get a license or a passport.\\u201d Jenny said, \\u201cthat sounds great, \\u201cbut I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019d get a license or a passport \\u2019cause they don\\u2019t make me get one.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cyeah, but it\\u2019s the law.\\u201d You know. Jenny says, \\u201cyeah, I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ll get one \\u201c\\u2019cause they don\\u2019t make me get one, you know. That\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d That\\u2019s how Jenny argues things. Sometimes she\\u2019ll just say, \\u201cthat\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d And I\\u2019ll say, \\u201cthat\\u2019s not an argument.\\u201d \\u201cLike, we\\u2019re not even in an argument right now because you don\\u2019t have an argument.\\u201d And she\\u2019ll say, \\u201cI just won that argument.\\u201d And I\\u2019ll say, \\u201cthat\\u2019s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is.\\u201d And she\\u2019ll say, \\u201cI just won that argument,\\u201d again. \\u201cThat\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d You could see how this could be a little bit maddening, you know, uh\\u2026 On our final day on the trip, we got into an argument about essentially nothing. She noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel, and she said, \\u201cwe should play.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cyeah, but not, like, a game.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cwhy?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, \\u2019cause I\\u2019d win.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cno, I think I would win.\\u201d I go, \\u201cno. I know that I\\u2019d win, \\u201cand I know that what I\\u2019m supposed to say is that\\u2026 \\u201cThe guy says, \\u2018I\\u2019ll win,\\u2019 the girl says, \\u2018I\\u2019ll win,\\u2019 \\u201cand the guy lets her win, and then she likes him more. But I just don\\u2019t have that in me.\\u201d And Jenny goes, \\u201cyou don\\u2019t have to let me win. Let\\u2019s go out and play.\\u201d And so we went out and played basketball, and I just kicked her ass. I mean, it was just like\\u2026 It was just like\\u2026 10 to 1, you know, 11 to 1. I mean, I was having a good day, but still, I was just destroying her. And at one point, she literally said, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never met someone who\\u2019s so obsessed with the score.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cthe score is what makes it a game!\\u201d So we\\u2019re arguing this over lunch, and then, again, it comes up at dinner, and then we\\u2019re still arguing about it at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning about essentially nothing. And she said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t understand why you\\u2019re so obsessed with being right.\\u201d I go, \\u201cI\\u2019m not obsessed with it. I just am.\\u201d I said, \\u201cwhy do you think you\\u2019re right?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cthat\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d I said, \\u201cif you think I\\u2019m so wrong about everything, why are you even with me?\\u201d And Jenny says, \\u201cyou can\\u2019t choose who you love.\\u201d Which is true, but it doesn\\u2019t mean it\\u2019s good. I remember the first time I fell in love, I was in high school, and it was that first time where you fall in love, and you\\u2019re just like, \\u201cthis is it. I found her. I\\u2019m 17 years old, and I\\u2019m done, you know.\\u201d And\\u2026 Her name was Amanda, and she was, like, adorable and funny. And what was really exciting for me was that she was, like, a delinquent. Like, I was like this play-by-the-rules school citizen, and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid, which I thought was a really strong quality. Like, at one point, she was like, \\u201cit was totally messed up because it wasn\\u2019t even me. It was this other girl, and I was framed.\\u201d And I was just like, \\u201cawesome.\\u201d Like no one would ever frame me for anything. I just\\u2026 I thought it was like an opposites attract situation. She wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper. And I wanted to know what it was like to be cool. At one point, I was like, \\u201cdo you want to write an article for the newspaper?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to write an article. I want to do things people write articles about.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cgood answer.\\u201d\\nI find that when you fall in love, you tend to overlook certain red flags. One of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me, but then she would pull it back. She\\u2019d be like, \\u201cno one likes you at all. Only kidding.\\u201d Or, like, \\u201cyou\\u2019re like a nerd, but you\\u2019re not even smart. Just joking.\\u201d Can\\u2019t choose who you love.\\nSecond red flag with Amanda was that she was a liar. And I don\\u2019t\\u2026 I don\\u2019t mean that in an offensive way. Like, lying was kind of like a\\u2026 It\\u2019s like a sport at the school I was at. I transferred from the all boys school to this co-ed school. There was this one guy in my class named Keith Robbins who was a legendary liar. You\\u2019d know when he was lying \\u2019cause he would lick his finger like a bookie, and he would dart his eyes from side to side. And he\\u2019d go, \\u201cyeah, yeah, nice. Nice, you know.\\u201d And he wasn\\u2019t even handling money. Like, I don\\u2019t even know what this is about. And then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant. He\\u2019d be like, \\u201cyeah, my uncle\\u2019s Tony Robbins, \\u201cmotivational speaker. Yeah, nice, you know.\\u201d And\\u2026 We found out that that wasn\\u2019t even true. But even if that were true, that wouldn\\u2019t be impressive to a bunch of high school students. But I think that\\u2019s the jedi level of lying, is you lie about little stuff, and no one notices when you\\u2019re lying about big stuff. It\\u2019s like banking.\\nThe final red flag with Amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend. I know. I\\u2019m in the future also. I think we can all see now \\u2019cause we\\u2019re so smart, and Mike\\u2019s so dumb, and, uh\\u2026 You know, I can also see, in retrospect, that\\u2019s a much bigger red flag than I perceived it to be at the time, but I was so excited she was even with me at all. And she said she had another boyfriend at home, but they were in the process of breaking up, but it was a bad time \\u2019cause his parents were sick. And so I tried to be understanding of that. You know, I went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents. And I thought, \\u201cwell, this is the affirmation that I need. I\\u2019m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend.\\u201d And I drive my mom\\u2019s station wagon to Amanda\\u2019s parents\\u2019 house, and I walk in the front door, and there\\u2019s Amanda, and there\\u2019s her parents, and it\\u2019s going well. And a few hours go by, and this other guy comes over to the house, and his name is Scott. I\\u2019m assuming he\\u2019s, like, a family friend or a relative. And slowly I\\u2019m noticing similarities between Scott and things that Amanda has said about her other boyfriend. They\\u2019re both in their first year in college, and they\\u2019re competitive wrestlers, and\\u2026 It\\u2019s dawning on me that I\\u2019m hanging out with my girlfriend\\u2019s boyfriend. And it\\u2019s going pretty well. I mean, he\\u2026 He seemed like a nice guy. I could totally see what she saw in him. There was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom, she would hold on to my hand, and she would say, \\u201cI wish it were just you and me here.\\u201d And I remember thinking, \\u201cyou could make that happen.\\u201d The way she said it was as though she weren\\u2019t involved in the decision process, like, \\u201cI\\u2019d love to, but the boys in corporate\\u2026\\u201d\\nWell, the day took an even stranger turn when Scott suggested that we go hang out at his house. And I met his parents. It is indescribable meeting your girlfriend\\u2019s boyfriend\\u2019s parents for the first time. Part of you is angry for obvious reasons, but then part of you still wants to make a good impression. You know, you\\u2019re like\\u2026 \\u201cMaybe if this goes well, she\\u2019ll see that I\\u2019m good with adults in general!\\u201d As a side note, his parents seemed in perfect health. At one point, his dad even said to me, \\u201chow do you know Amanda?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwe\\u2019re just friends from school.\\u201d And I was so ashamed, and I felt so dumb. And I drove home, and I remember thinking, \\u201cI am never gonna let this happen to me again.\\u201d So\\u2026 Ten months into my relationship with Jenny, she invites me to meet her parents. And this was a tricky time. At this point, our relationship was intense, but casual, which is a dangerous relationship cocktail, and it was a hard thing to organize \\u2019cause I was away probably five days out of the week. And so we found a Sunday where I was coming back from a five-day stint in Texas, which was awful \\u2019cause it was\\u2026 In Texas. And I\\u2026 that\\u2019s\\u2026 That\\u2019s not to say I dislike Texas entirely. It\\u2019s such a large thing to dislike. And, uh\\u2026 But that week it felt like Texas just disliked me, and I just kind of disliked Texas back to the point where I developed a small drinking problem, which is\\u2026 which is very popular in Texas. I was performing at a comedy club. Now, comedy\\u2026 I love comedy clubs \\u2019cause they\\u2019re sort of a high-low entertainment proposition. Like, in some ways, though, they\\u2019re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word, and then some of them sell dildo straws, you know. Like, there\\u2019s 15 bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends, and they\\u2019re handing out gummy penises or whatever. That\\u2019s\\u2026 that\\u2019s actually a thing. I didn\\u2019t even realize that\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was\\u2026 was the gummy quality of the penis. I feel like if I were in charge of the candification of the penis, it would be hard candy. And then if\\u2026 And then, if you suck it down to the gummy part, then you just sort of put that off to the side. But I\\u2026 but that\\u2019s\\u2026 that\\u2019s not my job. I\\u2019m\\u2026 you know, I leave that to the experts, but I just\\u2026 I just do the comedy part. But I was performing at this club all week, and after the late show Saturday night, I was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things. And\\u2026 I\\u2019d been drinking all week, and, uh, I always try to be a team player, you know. So I was like, \\u201cwhatever I can do to help. I don\\u2019t see how this could end badly.\\u201d And, uh\\u2026 The next morning, I wake up in the my hotel room, and I\\u2019m hung over, and I\\u2019m groggy. And I roll out of bed, and I run to the airport to catch my flight. I\\u2019m still two hours early, and\\u2026 I land in New York, and I get a cab to Jenny\\u2019s parents\\u2019 house. And I walk in the front door, and there\\u2019s Jenny, and there\\u2019s her parents. And there\\u2019s her other sort of ex-boyfriend, John. And he wasn\\u2019t front and center. Like, he was just kind of around, like, he was in the pool, like, wading and doing laps, like, that kind of thing. But I pulled Jenny aside, I was like, \\u201cwell, what\\u2019s John doing here?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cwell, he and I aren\\u2019t still together, \\u201cbut when we were together, \\u201che became friends with my stepdad, \\u201cand he\\u2019s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cyou know, that\\u2019s not good. I feel like that gives him the edge.\\u201d Jenny\\u2019s staring at me. And I said, \\u201cwhat?\\u201d She says, \\u201cyou have a hickey on your neck.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s true.\\u201d And then I glance at the mirror next to me and realize that, in fact, I do have a hickey on my neck. And I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry.\\u201d And she says, \\u201cwhere is that from?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cthere was this bachelorette party, and I was drunk.\\u201d That sentence never comes out right. I mean, there\\u2019s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay, and\\u2026 We start arguing, and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment. I didn\\u2019t have a leg to stand on. I was like, \\u201cwell, what about John? What was he doing there?\\u201d She said, \\u201cyou have a hickey on your neck.\\u201d I said, \\u201cyeah, but at least I told you the truth.\\u201d And she said, \\u201ceventually.\\u201d And I said, \\u201ceventually is better than never!\\u201d And then she kneed me in the balls. I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever experienced this before. I\\u2019m sure half of you have not. Uh\\u2026 It\\u2019s like being electrocuted, except you don\\u2019t get to die. It\\u2019s like you want to die, but you can\\u2019t. And there\\u2019s a person in your face saying, \\u201cyou deserve this,\\u201d which they wouldn\\u2019t even do in electrocutions. I think they would deem that as inhumane.\\u00a0 Even in Texas.\\nJenny says, \\u201cI think that we should just break up. \\u201cYou know, it\\u2019s not just this. \\u201cI mean, you\\u2019re away a lot of the time. \\u201cAnd even when you\\u2019re here, you work at night, \\u201cand I work in the day. I just don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s gonna work out.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cokay.\\u201d\\u00a0 And we were apart for about six months, and I missed her so much, but I kept resisting calling her \\u2019cause I wanted to give her space. And every once in a while I\\u2019d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from \\u201cJen, Irish pub, nice.\\u201d And it would just say, \\u201chi.\\u201d And I\\u2019d write back, \\u201chi.\\u201d It was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another, but I think, in some ways, kept us together. And finally, on new year\\u2019s, I caved in, and I called her, I said, \\u201chey, I really miss you, and I want to see you.\\u201d And we got together for coffee. And we hit it off just like we used to, and we decided we would get back together. We had a great period there, you know. I took her to get a license and a passport. First, we went for her social security card, and then we took that to the D.M.V. And then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport. It was like the triple crown of identifications. Jenny was wildly identifiable. One night, she was heading back from my apartment to hers, and she stops. And I said, \\u201cwhat?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cI think that we should live together.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno, I really don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s a good idea. \\u201cYou know, I\\u2019ve just decided, you know, as a principle, \\u201cI\\u2019m not gonna get married or live with someone. It\\u2019s not personal.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cwell, unless we live together, \\u201cI just don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s gonna work out \\u201c\\u2019cause we just don\\u2019t see each other enough, \\u201cand I don\\u2019t think that we stand a chance. That\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d So we moved in together. And one day, Jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends, and she invites me to come along. And I said, \\u201coh, no, thanks.\\u201d That doesn\\u2019t go over so well. She says, \\u201cwhy?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, as you know, \\u201cI don\\u2019t believe in marriage, and so I don\\u2019t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it.\\u201d She said, \\u201cwell, what do you believe in?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\u201d She said, \\u201cwell, if you don\\u2019t believe in anything, how can you not believe in marriage?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, first of all, \\u201cyou know, it just doesn\\u2019t seem necessary. \\u201cI mean, is it\\u2026 you know, \\u201cmarriage is an archaic institution \\u201cinvented in the middle ages based on exchanging property. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to be a part of that. \\u201cSecond of all, I don\\u2019t even think we have \\u201ca common cultural understanding of what marriage even is. \\u201cI mean, one of me and Andy\\u2019s friends \\u201cwas about to get engaged, and we were skeptical, \\u201cand we said, \\u2018are you sure this is the person \\u201cyou want to be with for the rest of your life?\\u2019 \\u201cand he goes, \\u2018yeah, I think so.\\u2019 \\u201cand we said, \\u2018well, what if she gets in a car accident, \\u201cand she\\u2019s disfigured? Would you stay with her then?\\u2019 \\u201cand he said, \\u2018maybe\\u2019! \\u201cThat is not an acceptable answer! \\u201cThird of all, if I\\u2019m so in love, \\u201cwhy does it need to be written into a government contract? \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m not one of these like, \\u201c\\u2018I don\\u2019t want government up in my business\\u2019 kind of people! \\u201cI think the government does a nice job \\u201cdelivering the mail and suggesting I don\\u2019t eat poison, \\u201cbut I just don\\u2019t understand why they need to be involved \\u201cin my personal relationships. \\u201cThen finally, if marriage is religious, \\u201cshouldn\\u2019t I believe in the religion? \\u201cI\\u2019ve been to more weddings of my friends \\u201cwhere the people on the altar don\\u2019t believe \\u201cin the religion of the church they\\u2019ve invited us to! \\u201cSome of them even go to classes with the priest \\u201cin advance, to more elaborately lie \\u201cabout believing in a religion they don\\u2019t believe in \\u201cjust to have a wedding in a fancy building! \\u201cThat is insane! That\\u2019s how I feel!\\u201d So I explain this to Jenny. And Jenny says, \\u201cwell, if you ever did want to get married, I would marry you.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwhy? Aren\\u2019t you listening to any of this?\\u201d And Jenny says, \\u201cthat\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d At this point, it was 5:00 in the morning, we\\u2019d been arguing all night, and we hadn\\u2019t slept. I had to catch a flight at 6:20 A.M. Out of Newark airport to Los Angeles for a show I was doing that night. At this point, I\\u2019m overtired, and I\\u2019m angry, and I\\u2019m late. I\\u2019m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase. And I walk out of our apartment. It\\u2019s 5:00 A.M., that part of the morning before the earth even exists, before they program The Matrix or whatever. You walk out of your apartment, part of the road isn\\u2019t even there. There\\u2019s a guy with a laptop going, \\u201cwe need a road, stat! What\\u2019s the code for building, tank?\\u201d You know, and I get to the airport. The news hasn\\u2019t even started yet. It\\u2019s just an anchor looking around like, \\u201cwhat are you up to?\\u201d And I get to the kiosk, and I print up my ticket, and I bring it to the security lady, and she looks at me, and she goes, \\u201cwell, that ain\\u2019t your gate.\\u201d Like, I guess they changed the gate, but the way she said it was as though I had participated in the decision of changing it. I was like, \\u201cI was not involved in this process. I wasn\\u2019t even C.C.\\u2019d.\\u201d Like, as though I had gone to the kiosk and been like, \\u201cB22. Like hell I\\u2019m flying out of B22.\\u201d And then I photoshopped my own ticket, printed it out, and been like, \\u201cthis is where I\\u2019m going.\\u201d You know, I\\u2019m not that aggressive as a traveler, so I was like, \\u201cwell, where is this gate?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cit\\u2019s in another terminal. You got to take a tram.\\u201d She points to the tram, and I start walking my roller suitcase, and I hear her say, \\u201cand you better run.\\u201d Like, I guess I was late at that point. So I started running. And the roller suitcase does not enjoy running. The roller suitcase was like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to run. I have wheels.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to run either, but this is what we have to do. \\u201cI tell you what, when we get to the hotel, I\\u2019ll walk you in circles for a few hours.\\u201d Then I\\u2026 I get to the tram, and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives. And it says zero minutes. I was like, \\u201cperfect. That\\u2019s exactly how long I want to wait.\\u201d But the tram\\u2019s riding away. I was like, \\u201cthat\\u2019s -1 minute!\\u201d Then it says ten minutes, and I\\u2019m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like, \\u201coh, great, I\\u2019m gonna miss my flight, \\u201cand then I\\u2019m gonna miss every flight from now on, \\u201cand I\\u2019m gonna miss my family reunion. \\u201cAnd then I\\u2019m not gonna have a family, and then I\\u2019m gonna be a crack whore.\\u201d And it\\u2019s like, all of a sudden, I\\u2019m a crack whore just because I miss this one flight. I can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and\\u2026\\nI get on the next tram ten minutes later, and I run to the gate, and I\\u2019m sweaty, and I\\u2019m out of breath, but I\\u2019m on time. And I\\u2019m so relieved that I sit down in a chair at the gate, and I fall asleep. And I wake up to the sound of the door shutting. I jump up, and the door is closed, and I am on the sad side of the door. The happy side has an airplane and a pilot. The sad side is me and the Cinnabon lady. Normally, I\\u2019d be very excited if it were just me and the Cinnabon lady. I\\u2019m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year. I think that\\u2019s an effective use of time. But in this instance, I needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane. And the Cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community. I was like, \\u201cdo you know these people?\\u201d She was like, \\u201call I know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun.\\u201d I ran up to the giant glass window. I started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy. I was like, \\u201cDrew Barrymore\\u2019s character, come back!\\u201d She didn\\u2019t come back, and I missed my flight. I got on the next one they could get me on. There was a stopover in Texas. You know how I feel about Texas. And, uh, I get to Los Angeles late that night, and I\\u2019d missed my show. I\\u2019d never missed one of my shows before, and I\\u2019m so angry. And Jenny\\u2019s calling me, but I\\u2019m not picking up the phone \\u2019cause I\\u2019m blaming this entire day on her. I get back to my friend Andy\\u2019s house, and I said, \\u201cAndy, this relationship is messing up my entire life!\\u201d And Andy goes, \\u201cyou\\u2019re right.\\u201d I go, \\u201cI know! I\\u2019m right!\\u201d He goes, \\u201cyeah, you\\u2019re right.\\u201d I go, \\u201cI know, I\\u2019m right! I got to tell her about this in the morning!\\u201d I drive out of Andy\\u2019s small road, and I\\u2019m t-boned. That\\u2019s the culinary way of describing it. In 1 1/2 seconds, I\\u2019m spun around, and I think I\\u2019m dead. No, wait, I\\u2019m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. Then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. 20 minutes later I\\u2019m sitting on a curb. At this point, the police have arri\\u2026 have arrived, as well as my friend, Andy, and that\\u2019s when I start crying. You know how when you drop a baby on the ground, it doesn\\u2019t\\u2026 Doesn\\u2019t start crying right away because it doesn\\u2019t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face? And then it\\u2019s like, \\u201coh, I guess I should be doing something \\u201cthat matches that. Waah!\\u201d I\\u2019m crying because I\\u2019m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that, in that moment, I might have ceased to exist. Like I said earlier, I don\\u2019t really believe in anything, so in my mind, that would have been the end of all things I\\u2019d experienced in my life. Every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion, and\\u2026 The officer comes over, and he says, \\u201cwhat happened?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI got hit by this car, \\u201cand then I heard nothing, and then I heard the other car skid out and drive away.\\u201d The officer points over to the light. The other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree. I can\\u2019t help but think, \\u201cthat\\u2019s karma. That\\u2019s a hit and run and hit.\\u201d And then the officer puts this form in my face, and he goes, \\u201csign this.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, what does it mean?\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cit means you\\u2019re okay and that we can leave.\\u201d I was really shaken up. I was like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m okay.\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cjust sign it,\\u201d which is a very unattractive quality. When someone just repeats a command that you\\u2019ve just said no to, and it\\u2019s unattractive, but very effective, you know. I signed it. Andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution, but we have to wait two hours \\u2019cause the other driver had beat us there, and\\u2026 Eventually, we\\u2019re with the doctor, and Andy says to him, he goes, \\u201cwell, was the other guy drunk?\\u201d And the doctor says, \\u201cwell, I can\\u2019t answer that.\\u201d And Andy says, \\u201cwas he?\\u201d He uses the technique we had learned earlier, and it works, you know. The doctor says, \\u201cwell, he\\u2019s heading to jail now.\\u201d And Andy and I flash each other a look like the hardy boys, like, \\u201ccase closed.\\u201d A few hours later, we\\u2019re back at Andy\\u2019s house, it\\u2019s probably around 3:30 in the morning, and I have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have near-death experiences. I say, \\u201cI need to call Jenny and tell her that we need to get married.\\u201d And Andy says, \\u201cMike\\u2026 Sleep on it.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno, no, no, this makes perfect sense.\\u201d And I pick up my phone, and I dial her number. And he puts his hand over the phone, and he says, \\u201cMike\\u2026 Sleep on it.\\u201d He saves me. The next morning, I fly back to New York, and a few weeks later, I get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that I just described. And it had found me at fault and that I owed\\u2026 And I\\u2019m not making this up\\u2026 $12,000 for the repairs on the other driver\\u2019s Mercedes S.U.V. And I was like, \\u201cwell, this can\\u2019t be happening.\\u201d I explained to the woman, \\u201cI think it\\u2019s a misunderstanding. \\u201cThe other guy was clearly drunk. It was definitely not my fault.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry, but unless they change the accident report, you owe this money.\\u201d So I requested the accident report, and I\\u2019m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight. I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever seen one of these things before\\u2026 But it\\u2019s a little bit like homework for cops. And officer timson not so good with the homework. He consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two, vehicle one and vehicle two. At one point, so badly that he says P-1\\u2026 that\\u2019s me\\u2026 started to go, but all of a sudden V-1\\u2026 That\\u2019s me also\\u2026 Came at a high rate of speed, crashing into him. Now, I\\u2019m pretty self-destructive as a person, but I would never crash into my own car with my own car, nor would I understand how you could do that. This part is even crazier. The other driver\\u2019s statement at the scene of the accident was, \\u201cI was on Venice going\\u2026 uh, I\\u2019m not too sure. \\u201cI was going away from the beach. \\u201cI was driving. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what happened. \\u201cDid I hurt anyone? \\u201cI don\\u2019t know where I was going, \\u201cbut I came from home. I had a sip of beer.\\u201d Which is really everyone\\u2019s favorite quantity of beer. Just the one sip, right? That\\u2019s what they serve these days at the home/beach/pub.\\nSo all of it\\u2019s mine. The officer makes one key mistake. He checks the box that finds me at fault. So I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI need to get officer Timson on the phone, so we can clear up this misunderstanding.\\u201d The problem is he keeps ducking my calls, and I know \\u2019cause I\\u2019m calling two or three times a day, leaving messages, calling departments next to his department, so he knows I\\u2019m trying to reach him. And finally, after a month of this, I get him on the phone, and I\\u2019m so relieved. And I explain this misunderstanding. And he listens to me, and he says, \\u201cdo the right thing, and pay for the guy\\u2019s car.\\u201d I know, and, I mean, that\\u2019s what I said. I go, \\u201caren\\u2019t you listening to any of this?\\u201d I go, \\u201cand this guy was clearly drunk. \\u201cI mean, he nearly killed me. \\u201cInches from where he hit, \\u201cand I would be dead right now. \\u201cAnd he wants me to pay for his car? \\u201cDon\\u2019t you see how crazy that is, just as one human being to another?\\u201d And he says, \\u201cdo the right thing, and pay for the guy\\u2019s car.\\u201d And he hangs up the phone. And at this point, this stops being about money, and it\\u2019s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law. This is Chinatown! So I started printing up Google maps of the scene of the accident and California state driving law. I\\u2019m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators. There\\u2019s only one lawyer who would consider the case. And he was an accident lawyer, and he said, \\u201cdid you have any loss of income from the accident?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno,\\u201d and he says, \\u201cdid you have any loss of income from the accident?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno. This isn\\u2019t about money.\\u201d And he doesn\\u2019t take the case, and this is when I start going completely mad.\\nI\\u2019m up to about 4:00 or 5:00 A.M. every night just surfing the web. I get a subscription to a site called netdetective.com, which is a great site for vigilantes who have $29.95. So now I know this guy\\u2019s name, I know where he lives, I know what he does for a living. And in my mind, it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller. Like, \\u201cJim Bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this, \\u201cbut Jim Bosworth had another thing coming: Mike Birbiglia.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna track down Jim Bosworth. \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna sue Jim Bosworth, and I\\u2019m gonna sue the entire Los Angeles police department!\\u201d At this point, people stopped talking to me entirely. My friends would call me like, \\u201chey, what\\u2019s going on?\\u201d I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cI\\u2019ll tell you what\\u2019s going on!\\u201d I\\u2019d tell them this whole story. And they\\u2019d be like, \\u201cyou should get a lawyer.\\u201d I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cthis is way past lawyers! A lawyer wouldn\\u2019t even touch this!\\u201d \\u2018Cause he wouldn\\u2019t.\\nThe only person who would talk to me at this point was Jenny. One night, we were out to dinner at a restaurant, and she\\u2019s talking to me, but I\\u2019m not listening \\u2019cause I\\u2019m writing down ideas I have for the case on my napkin. I\\u2019ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection, and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in, the laws the other driver broke, and the phone numbers I\\u2019m gonna call that week. And I\\u2019m so angry, I\\u2019m writing over my own handwriting to the point where I\\u2019m ripping through the napkin. And Jenny looks at me, and she says, \\u201cwhat are you doing?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, this is my case.\\u201d And she says, \\u201cwell, why don\\u2019t you work on that in the morning?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, which part of this napkin don\\u2019t you understand?\\u201d Jenny says, \\u201cMike\\u2026 \\u201cYou\\u2019re right, \\u201cbut it\\u2019s only hurting you, \\u201cand I\\u2019m just so glad that you\\u2019re alive, and I think that we should focus on that.\\u201d She only has to say it once, and I give up the case, and I pay for this guy\\u2019s car. July 7, 2007, Jenny and I went to city hall and got married. I still didn\\u2019t believe in the idea of marriage, and I still don\\u2019t. But I believe in her, and I\\u2019ve given up on the idea of being right. Thank you guys very much. Thank you. Thank you guys so much!
